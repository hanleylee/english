# This elephant learned to use a hose as a shower. Then her rival sought revenge

Elephants love showering to cool off, and most do so by sucking water into their trunks and spitting it over their bodies. But an elderly pachyderm named Mary has perfected the technique by using a hose as a showerhead, much in the way humans do. The behavior is a remarkable example of sophisticated tool use in the animal kingdom. But the story doesn't end there.

Mary's long, luxurious baths have drawn so much attention that an envious elephant at the Berlin Zoo has figured out how to shut the water off on her supersoaking rival—a type of sabotage rarely seen among animals.

Both behaviors, reported today in Current Biologynone, further cement elephants as complex thinkers, says Lucy Bates, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Portsmouth not involved in the study. The work, she says, "suggests problem solving or even 'insight.'"

Many elephants enjoy playing with hoses, probably because they remind them of trunks, says Michael Brecht, a computational neuroscientist at Humboldt University of Berlin. But Mary takes the activity to another level. Using her trunk, the 54-year-old Asian elephant (Elephas maximus)—a senior citizen, given the average captive life span of her species of 48 years—holds a hose over her head and waves it back and forth. She also changes her grip on the hose to spray different parts of her body and swings it like a lasso to throw water over her back.

Brecht's graduate student, Lena Kaufmann, noticed Mary's hose use while studying other types of behavior in the zoo's elephants; the zookeepers told her Mary did this frequently. So Kaufman and her colleagues started to record the showering on video over the course of a year, testing how Mary reacted to changes in the setup.

When the team offered Mary hoses of different sizes, for instance, she used the smaller hose less because it was harder to manipulate with her trunk. The flexible way in which Mary could use hoses—fairly complex tools—for different purposes and her apparent understanding of water ballistics impressed the researchers, who hadn't seen anything like it in elephants.

Mary is "left-trunked"—the equivalent of left-handed in humans—so holding the hose made it easier for her to reach her left side. She tended to spray her right side with her trunk, because she preferred to curve her proboscis that way. But the other elephants in her enclosure never seemed to pick up on her technique. "It's really very much Mary that is so exceptional," Brecht says.

Because Mary was born in the wild and has previously lived in other zoos, it's unclear whether she learned how to shower from other elephants or invented the strategy herself. During the time Brecht and colleagues spent with her, they gave her extra time with the hose and showered her with praise. Mary enjoyed being the center of attention and seemed to rub her comrades' trunks in it, waving her showerhead around as if to say, "Hey, I have the hose, look!" Brecht says.

But unlike the scientists, the other elephants weren't impressed—particularly 12-year-old Anchali, who was born in the zoo. "She's really crazy about hoses," Brecht says, adding that caretakers had had to restrict Anchali's hose access when she was a baby because she would play with them so much she'd destroy them.

When the researchers started to give Mary extra shower time, Anchali seemed to resent it. "I think that may have increased the envy a bit," Brecht says. A few weeks after the experiments began, Anchali figured out she could interrupt her colleague's showers by picking the hose up with her trunk and kinking it to stop the water flow.

Brecht says his lab members didn't initially believe Anchali was smart enough to deliberately sabotage Mary. But several things convinced them that the pachyderm knew exactly what she was doing. Kinking the hose is a complex behavior that requires a lot of twisting and pressure. Over the weeks in which the researchers were studying Mary's showers, Anchali began to kink the hose more frequently and got better at it, suggesting she was practicing and learning. She also started to stand on the hose—something the caretakers had specifically trained the elephants not to do.

Anchali had a potential motive, too: Mary was occasionally aggressive toward the younger elephant, who seemed to retaliate by disrupting the shower around the same time as Mary stomped toward her or slapped her with her trunk. What's more, Anchali didn't kink the hose when other elephants were spraying themselves, suggesting she was targeting Mary in particular.

Bates says both behaviors suggest insight instead of simple trial and error. But that's a difficult thing to prove without more observations, she says. "Obviously we don't know if [Anchali's] original intention was to stop Mary's shower, but the fact she persevered and got better at doing this is quite compelling."

Bates says it's not clear whether Anchali was vengeful toward Mary or was just teasing her in the way that some apes do while playing. But she says the findings show the importance of monitoring the behavior of captive animals over time. "I am convinced that elephants—and possibly lots of animals—do all sorts of interesting things that we often miss, or dismiss as one-offs or anecdotes."
