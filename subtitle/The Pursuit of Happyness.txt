我是克里斯·迦纳    I'm Chris Gardner.
我第一次见到我父亲时 已经28岁了    I met my father for the first time when I was 28 years old.

它比X光机显像更精确一点点 但却贵了一倍    It gave a slightly denser picture than an x- ray for twice the money.
- 嘿 - 嘿 宝贝    - Hey. - Hey, baby.
- 怎么啦？ - 没...没事儿    - What happened? - No, nothing.
只是...我今天不能去接儿子    Look, I can't get Christopher today.
你得去 我七点还要上班    Oh, no, you don't, Chris. I'm back on at 7.
我知道 但我一定要去奥克兰    I know. I have got to go to Oakland.
所以我得先接他回家 做饭 给他洗澡...    So I gotta get Christopher home, feed him, bathe him...
哄他睡觉 然后七点前回到这儿？    get him in bed, and be back here by 7?

你是干什么？ 你是怎么干的？    What do you do? And how do you do it? 
- 我是股票经纪人 - 股票经纪人 哦 天哪    - I'm a stockbroker. - Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

周末我这车就借你了    I'll let you hang on to my car for the weekend.

他们全都看起来 超幸福的样子    They all looked so damn happy to me.
为什么我不能也满脸幸福？    Why couldn't I look like that? 
我尽量在六点前回来    I'm gonna try to get home by 6.
下班后要去一下证券行    I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm after work.
- 干嘛？ - 看看那里有没有工作    - For what? - I wanna see about a job there.

我在那儿有个会 带这个进去看上去很不正式    I have a meeting in there and I don't wanna carry that Iooking smalltime.
先给你1块钱 一会我出来再多给你点    Here is a dollar and I'll give you more money when I come back out.

申请表上“高中”之后还有3行线 用来填写接受过的其他教育    There were three blank lines after "high school" to list more education.
对我来说 根本就是多余    I didn't need that many lines.
快睡觉 不早了    Try and sleep. It's late.
这种魔方每面都是3英寸x3英寸    It' a puzzle measuring just 3 inches by 3 inches on each side...

这小玩意是1981年的送礼佳品    This little cube is the gift sensation of 1981.

再见    Bye.
那里写的是“辛” 但是实际上应该是“幸”    It's written as P- P- Y, but it's supposed to be an I in "happiness."
- 是形容词吗？ - 不是 是个名词    - Is it an adjective? - No, actually it's a noun.
但是字写错了    But it's not spelled right.
- “操”写对了吗？ - 对 那个写的对    - Is "fuck" spelled right? - Yeah, that's spelled right.
但是标语里没这词 所以别学    But that's not part of the motto, so you're not supposed to learn that.
那词是大人用来表达他们愤怒之类的    That's an adult word to show anger and other things.
- 别用那词 好吗？ - 好的    - But just don't use that one, okay? - Okay.
你书包背后写的是什么？    What's that say on the back of your bag?

那儿的人都戴牛仔帽 那种“10加仑”牛仔帽 （宽边软顶牛仔帽 因分量重而得名）    Everybody wears cowboy hats. And a ten- gallors a big hat.
我小时候很聪明 所以大家都叫我“无- 敌- 大- 头”    I was smart back then, so they called me Ten- Gallon Head.

一直看电视的话 我们就带他走    watching TV all day, we're taking him out of here.
你要是不喜欢海军片的话 就多花钱去别家幼儿园好了    Go pay more at other daycare if you don't like Navy TV.
反正你总是晚付钱 你抱怨 我还抱怨呢    You late pay anyway. You complain. I complain.
那能不能把狗带到楼上去？ 关到你房间或什么地方    Can you at least put the dog upstairs in your room or something? 
再见    Bye.
我在等维特公司 人事部主管杰·托斯特尔    I was waiting for Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...
他的名字听起来很可爱 就好像他会给我份工作 外加一个拥抱    whose name sounded so delightful, like he'd give me a job and a hug.
而我所要做的 就是让他知道 我精通数字 而且懂得待人之道    I just had to show him I was good with numbers and good with people.
- 早上好 托斯特尔先生 - 早上好    - Morning, Mr. Twistle. - Good morning.
- 托斯特尔先生 我是克里斯·迦纳 - 你好    - Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner. - Hi.
我得在你进去之前亲自把这个交给您 和您认识一下    I wanted to drop this off personally and make your acquaintance.
希望有机会能和您坐下聊聊    I thought I'd catch you on the way in. I'd love the opportunity to discuss...
我申请表上看起来比较薄弱的几点    what may seem like weaknesses on my application.
好的 我们要先看下你的申请表 克里斯 需要面试的话会通知你的    We'll start with this, and we'll call you if we wanna sit down.
- 好的 先生 祝您愉快 - 你也是    - Yes, sir. You have a great day. - You too.
嗨 你好    Hey, yeah, how you doing? 
我是克里斯·迦纳 找戴尔斯医生    This is Chris Gardner calling for Dr. Delsey.
我要晚一点才能来推销    Yeah, I'm running a little late for a sales call.
能不能...对 国立阿斯提公司    I was wondering if... Yeah, Osteo National.
对 我们能不能...半小时后？    Right. We can still...? Half an hour? 
太好了 没问题 谢谢    Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you, thank you.
嘿！嘿！    Hey! Hey! 
嘿！    Hey! 
我人生的这部分    This part of my life...
眼前的这部分    - Wait! ...this part here...
叫做“追赶”    it' called "Running."
嘿！嘿！    Hey! Hey! 
等一下！    Wait! 
嘿！等一下！    Hey! Wait! 
那是我被偷的仪器    That was my stolen machine.
除非跟她在一起的那家伙也是做这行的    Unless she was with a guy who sold them too.
不过可能性不大    Which was unlikely...
因为旧金山海湾地区 销售此仪器的仅我一家    because I was the only one selling them in the Bay Area.
我把所有的积蓄都押在这上面了    I spent our entire life savings on these things.
押在这个革命性的仪器上了    It was such a revolutionary machine.
- 亲爱的 你感觉到了吗？ - 当然了    - Can you feel it, baby? - Oh, yeah.
你在叫我一个人忙活    You got me doing all the work.
但是我没想到 医院的医生们    What I didn't know is that doctors and hospitals...
会认为它是没用的奢侈品    would consider them unnecessary luxuries.
我甚至请房东给我们照了相    I even asked the landlord to take a picture.
所以丢了一台仪器就意味着 损失了一个月的伙食    So if I lost one, it was like losing a month' groceries.
嘿！嘿！ 等一下 等一下！    Hey, hey! Wait! Wait! 
嘿！回来！    Hey, get back here! 
嘿 老兄 我...    Hey, man, l...
- 他是谁？ - 就是那个...    - Who's he? - He's that guy...

嘿    Hey.
嘿 妈    Hey, Mom.
1 2 3    One, two, three!     
- 是个篮球！ - 嗨 什么意思？    - That's a basketball! - Hey, hey. What do you mean? 
谁说这是篮球啊？    You don't know that that's a basketball.
有可能是“蚂蚁农场” 也可能是显微镜或别的什么    This could be an ant farm. This could be a microscope or anything.
- 不 不是的 - 拿不到了吧    - No, it's not. - There, there.
好吧 快打开吧    All right, come on. Open him up. Open him up.
- 纸有点厚 是吗？ - 是的 但是我能打开    - That paper's a little heavy, huh? - Yeah, but I got it.
你今天真应该在场的    You should've seen me out there today.
有个女孩偷了我的扫描仪 我就一直追她...    Somebody stole a scanner. I had to run the old girl down...
随便吧    Whatever.

你这是什么态度？    What the hell you got attitude about? 
- 随便什么？ - 每天都他妈的有逸闻    - "Whatever" what? - Every day's got some damn story.
嘿！罗伊！罗伊！    Hey, Roy. Roy! 
能不能没人的时候再拍毯子？    Can you beat your little rug when nobody's out here? 
尘土飞扬的    There's dust and shit all over.
- 我只是在打扫房间... - 嗨 等一下    - I'm trying to keep a clean house. - Hey, wait a second.
听我说 琳达 放松    Look, Linda, relax.
我们会渡过难关的 一切都会好起来的 好吗？    We're gonna come out of this. Everything is gonna be fine, all right? 
你以前就这么说过 我怀孕的时候 你就说：“一切都会好起来的”    You said that before, when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."
- 这么说你不再相信我了？ - 随便 我不在乎    - So you don't trust me now? - Whatever. I don't care.
- 出租！ - 托斯特尔先生    - Taxi! - Mr. Twistle.
- 是的 - 你好 我是克里斯·迦纳    - Yeah, hi. - Hi. Chris Gardner.
你好 有什么事吗？    Yeah, hi. Listen. What can I do for you? 
我一个月前交了份实习申请表    I submitted an application for the intern program about a month ago...
我想找机会和您坐下来简单谈谈...    and I would just love to sit with you briefly...
听着 我要赶去诺亚谷 克里斯    Listen, I'm going to Noe Valley, Chris.
- 你保重 - 托斯特尔先生    - Take care of yourself. - Mr. Twistle.
我正好也要去诺亚谷    Actually, I'm on my way to Noe Valley also.
我搭个车怎么样？    How about we share a ride? 
- 好吧 上车吧 - 好的    - All right, get in. - All right.
我在海军服役时为一个医生工作    So when I was in the Navy, I worked for a doctor...
他很喜欢高尔夫 每天都要花很多时间在那上面    who loved to play golf, hours every day...
我还得替他处理医疗事务    and I would actually perform medical procedures...
当他不在的时候    when he'd leave me in the office.
我习惯于做出抉择 而且...    So I'm used to being in a position where I have to make decisions and...
托斯特尔先生 听我说 这很重要    Mr. Twistle, listen. This is a very important...
对不起 对不起 这东西不可能拼出来的    I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This thing's impossible.
- 我可以 - 你不行 没人可以的    - I can do it. - No, you can't. No one can.
- 不可能的 - 我确定我能行的    - That's bullshit. - No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.
- 你不行 - 让我看看    - No, you can't. - Let me see it.
给我    Give it here.
哦 你真是拼的一团糟啊    Oh, yeah. Oh, wow, you really messed it up.
不好意思    Sorry.
看起来这些是围绕一个轴心转动 中间的这部分保持不动    It looks like it works around a swivel, so the center pieces never move.
所以说如果中间那片是黄色 这面就应该是黄色的    So if it's yellow in the center, that's the yellow side.
如果中间那片是红色 那么这面就应该是红色的    If it's red in the center, that's the red side.

想起了“独立宣言”    the Declaration of Independence...
想起了其中对生存权 自由权 以及追求幸福权利的描写    and the part about our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
我一直在想    And I remember thinking:
他是怎么知道要把“追求幸福” 那部分放进去的？    How did he know to put the "pursuit" part in there? 
也许幸福是只能去追求    That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue.
但是却永远也追求不到    And maybe we can actually never have it...
无论如何也追求不到的    no matter what.
他究竟是怎么知道的？    How did he know that?
