傍晚史塔克家要设宴为我们接风
Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

别扔下我独自应付

I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

我就知道你会这么说
I thought you might say that.

真有必要把她葬在这种地方？
Did you have to bury her in a place like this?

她应该安葬在风景优美的山丘上 头顶有阳光白云与她为伴
She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.

她属于这里
This is where she belongs.

每晚在梦中 我都要杀他一次

他是不是很慷慨啊？
Isn't he a gracious host?

请允许我介绍府上嘉宾
May I present my honored guests?

安达尔人及先民真正的国王 坦格利安家族的 韦赛里斯三世
Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

你看到他的头发有多长了没？
Do you see how long his hair is?

每当多斯拉克人在战斗中落败 他们便割去辫子 让全世界知道他们的耻辱
When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids so the whole world can see their shame.

卓戈卡奥一辈子都没吃过败仗
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

He's a savage, of course, but one of the finest killers alive.

请上前来 公主
Come forward, my dear.

见面仪式已经结束 可他还什么都没说呢！
The ceremony is over. But he didn't say anything.

您将率军渡过狭海 夺回您父王的王位
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea, and take back your father's throne.

全国上下的子民正偷偷举杯 向您致敬
The people drink secret toasts to your health.

他们会为真正的国王起而奋战
They cry out for their true king.

究竟何时完婚？
When will they be married?

很快 多斯拉克人不是拖泥带水的民族
Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.

他们真的连马都搞吗？
Is it true they lie with their horses?

你当我是笨蛋？
Do you take me for a fool?

我当您是王者
I take you for a king.

所谓王者无凡虑
Kings lack the caution of common men.

倘若我冒犯了您 我道歉
My apologies if I've given offense.

我很清楚怎么跟卓戈这号人打交道
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

我送他一个王后 他还我一支军队
I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

我不想当他的王后
I don't want to be his queen.

我想带咱俩一起回家 但我们的家早给人夺走了
I want us both to go home, but they took it from us.

你倒是说说看 好妹妹 我们怎么回家啊？
So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?

我们会带着军队 带着卓戈卡奥的千军万马杀回去
We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army.

只要能得到这支军队 就算得让整个卡拉萨 四万野蛮人 连同他们的马通通把你操上一遍… 我也会同意
I would let his whole tribe fuck you... All 40,000 men and their horses too if that's what it took.

那他就是有史以来最蠢的王子了
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

我们什么时候结婚啊？现在吗？还是得再等等？
When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?

别激动！婚事你父亲大人还没点头呢
Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.

他很快就要成为一人之下 万人之上的首相了
He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.

你当初不也是离家来这儿的吗？
You left your home to come here.

而我有朝一日将成为王后
And I'd be queen someday.

求你了 让父亲答应下来吧!
Please make father say yes!

这是我一辈子最大的心愿
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

我整日骑马赶回来 就是不忍心让你们独自应付兰尼斯特
Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.

你不去里面参加晚宴吗？
Why aren't you at the feast?

史塔克夫人认为若让私生子与王族同桌 对他们是种侮辱
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

好吧 长城上可没这些拘束
Well, you're always welcome on the wall.

私生子随时都有座
No bastard was ever refused a seat there.

你回去的时候带我一起走吧！
So take me with you when you go back.

长城又不会搬家 你不必…
The wall isn't going anywhere.

我该进去了 好给你父亲解围
I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests.

你叔叔可是守夜人？
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

你在这儿做什么？
What are you doing back there?

酝酿怎么跟你家人共度良宵呗
Preparing for a night with your family.

那你呢…你是奈德·史塔克的私生子 对吧？
And you... you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

我冒犯到你了吗?抱歉
Did I offend you? Sorry.

你确实是个私生子
You are the bastard though.

私生子小弟 让我给你一点建议罢
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

用它来武装自己 就没有人可以用它来伤害你
Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.

你又知道身为私生子是什么样子？
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

全天下的侏儒在他们父亲眼里都跟私生子没两样
All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.

你在宴会上 就像头困在笼子的熊
You at a feast... It's like a bear in a trap.

你认识他吗? 我当然认识
Did you know him? Of course I did.

说什么异鬼杀了他的伙伴
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

跟他同行的两名守夜人的确失踪了
The two he was with are still missing.

哼 多半是中了野人的埋伏
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

冰原狼在长城以南现身 异鬼出没的谣言 现在我哥哥也要去做首相了
Direwolves south of the wall, talk of the walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.

班杨叔叔 罗柏侄儿
Uncle Benjen. Robb boy.

你都好吗? 我很好啊
How are you? I'm good.

这是您第一次来北方吗 陛下？
Is this your first time in the north, Your Grace?

我敢说 跟君临相比 这儿一定严酷得紧
I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.

我还记得奈德第一次带我来这儿的时候我有多么恐惧
I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.

你真美啊
But you are a beauty.

多大了？ 十三岁 陛下
How old are you? 13, Your Grace.

挺高的啊 还在长个吗？
You're tall. Still growing?

我想是吧 陛下
I think so, Your Grace.

那你有过月事了吗?
And have you bled yet?

你的裙服 是你自己绣的？
Your dress, did you make it?

真是心灵手巧 日后也为我绣点什么吧
Such a talent. You must make something for me.

风传咱们两家要抱孙子了
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

你的女儿定会成为宫中的明珠
Your daughter will do well in the Capital.

这朵鲜花不应该埋没在这里
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.

让一让 听说咱们要做邻居了
Your pardon. I hear we might be neighbors soon.

但愿如此 不错 国王陛下有意赐予我一份莫大的荣誉
I hope it's true. Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

何不顺水推舟呢…我们才好继续举办比武会 以庆祝您走马上任
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title... if you accept.

跟您下场子切磋会很有趣
It would be good to have you on the field.

都是些老对手太无聊了
The competition has become a bit stale.

我不参加比武会 为什么？
I don't fight in tournaments. No?

年纪大了怕不方便吗?
Getting a little old for it?

我不参加比武会 是因为跟人真刀真枪干上的时候
I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real

我不想让对手知道我的本事
I don't want him to know what I can do.

她老是捣蛋
She always does this.

这是我最喜欢的裙子
This was my favorite dress.

她老是捣蛋 这一点也不好玩!
She always does it and it's not funny!

我属于这里 属于你 我无意南下去那个被称之为“都城”的老鼠窝
I belong here with you, not down south in that rats' nest they call a Capital.

我不会让他带走你的
I won't let him take you.

王命难违啊
The king takes what he wants.

谁能说个“不”字呢？
That's why he's king.

我会说 “听好了 死胖子”
I'll say, 'Listen, fat man.'

“不许你带走我老公”
'You are not taking my husband anywhere.

“他是要跟我厮守到老的”
He belongs to me now.'

他怎能长那么胖?
How did he get so fat?

不是吃就是喝 就成那样了呗
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.

鲁温师傅求见 陛下
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

请原谅 陛下 夫人
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

有飞骑深夜赶来…
A rider in the night...

你留下来 这封信来自鹰巢城
Stay. This was sent from the Eyrie.

她回鹰巢城去做什么?
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

结婚之后她就没在那儿待过
She hasn't been back there since her wedding.

她逃出了都城
She's fled the Capital.

她说琼恩·艾林乃是被人谋害
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

她还说国王的处境凶险万分
She says the king is in danger.

你妹妹刚做了寡妇 凯特
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

她根本不知道自己在说些什么
She doesn't know what she's saying.

此信若是落入他人手里莱莎就得掉脑袋
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter.

若她没有十足把握会甘冒这么大风险？赌上自己和儿子的性命吗？
Do you think she would risk her life...  her son's life...  if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?

如果此事属实如果兰尼斯特家族觊觎王位, 除了您 又有谁能保护国王呢？
If this news is true and the Lannisters conspire against the Throne, who but you can protect the king?

他们下毒手谋害了前任首相
They murdered the last hand.

你居然让奈德再去作牺牲品？
Now you want Ned to take the job?

国王马不停蹄地赶了一个月就是来向陛下求援的
The king rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark's help.

陛下是他唯一信任的人
He's the only one he trusts.

而您也曾誓言效忠您的国王
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

他为了劳勃戎马半生 问心无愧
He's spent half his life fighting Robert's wars.

你的父亲和兄长只去过南方一次…就是响应国王的召唤…
Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.

我何时可以跟卡奥谈判？
When do I meet with the Khal?

商议进军之事
We need to begin planning the invasion.

卓戈卡奥既已答应给您一顶王冠 您就一定能得到 何时?
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it. When?

当预兆显示战争吉利的时候
When their omens favor war.

我管他妈的多斯拉克预兆
I piss on Dothraki omens.

为夺回王位 我已经苦等了十七年
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

一场多斯拉克婚礼若没有闹出至少三条人命就算失败
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.

上前来吧，安达尔人乔拉
Come,Jorah the Andal.

薄礼一份 献给新的卡丽熙
A small gift, for the new khaleesi...

这是七国历史和歌谣传奇
Songs and Histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

你可是来自我的故国？
Are you from my country?

在下熊岛的乔拉·莫尔蒙爵士
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

曾为令尊效命多年
I served your father for many years.

诸神在上 我愿永远服侍真正的国王
Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.

这是龙蛋 丹妮莉丝殿下, 来自亚夏以东阴影之地
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

历经千万年而成化石 却依旧亮丽动人
The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.

乔拉爵士 我…我不知道多斯拉克语里 “谢谢”该怎么说？
Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say thank you in Dothraki.

多斯拉克人没有道谢一说
There is no word for thank you in Dothraki.

你会说通用语吗？
Do you know the common tongue?

你只知道这个词吗？
Is 'no' the only word that you know?

可不是嘛？ 我没吐别人一身已经是奇迹了
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other it'll be a miracle.

没有谁强迫你参加打猎
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

怎么？我可是最棒的猎人…“枪无虚发”的哦
The greatest in the land... my spear never misses.

掏了腰包那就不是打猎了
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

你的枪法没退步吧？
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?

不比当年了 但比你还是略胜一筹
No, but I'm still better than you.

我知道你很为难
I know what I'm putting you through.

谢谢你应允我
Thank you for saying yes.

若非不得已 我是不会请你出山的
I only ask you because I need you.

你是我真正的朋友
You're a loyal friend.

听见没？真正的朋友！
You hear me? A loyal friend.

如今也是我唯一的朋友
The last one I've got.

希望我别令你失望 不会的
I hope I'll serve you well. You will.

只要你别老是摆出这张阴沉的臭脸
And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time.

跟我走 孩子们！去猎几头野猪回来！
Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!

你不要命了吗？
Are you completely mad?

他瞧见我们了 没事 没事
He saw us. It's all right, it's all right.

没事 他瞧见我们了！
It's all right. He saw us!

我不是瞎子更不是聋子
I heard you the first time.

你这小鬼 挺能爬啊
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

今年几岁啦？ 十岁
How old are you, boy? 10.

好好想一想 我为爱情做了些什么
The things I do for love.

喝点水吧 孩子
You need to drink, child.

就没别的可吃吗？
Isn't there anything else?

多斯拉克人只有两样宝：
The Dothraki have two things in abundance:

草和骏马 可惜人不能吃草
Grass and horses. People can't live on grass.

在亚夏彼方的阴影之地 据说有一片鬼草原 鬼草的茎杆白得像白璃 夜里还会发光
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.

这种草会杀死其余的草
It murders all other grass.

多斯拉克人相信 有朝一日鬼草会占据全世界…那便是世界的末日
The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everythingthat's the way the world will end.

我们离开潘托斯还不远 陛下
We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace.

伊利里欧总督愿意继续款待您
Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality.

在他那儿您会住得舒适
You'd be more comfortable there.

我不在乎他的款待或者舒适生活
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.

我要盯着这个卓戈 直到他兑现交易 直到我得到王冠为止
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown.

如您所愿 陛下
As you wish, your Grace.

莫尔蒙 你就这么亡命天涯
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,

是怕回七国被砍头么？
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

你究竟怎么得罪奈德·史塔克的
What did Ned Stark want you for?

据说是跟奴隶贩子做交易？
Buying from a slaver?

不 我是把抓到的盗猎者 卖给了奴隶贩子
Selling to one some poachers I caught on my land.

你尽管放心 在我治下
Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.

人们才不会因为这区区小事而受罚
You can rest assured of that.

舅舅 昨晚的相好这么漂亮啊
Betterlooking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.

我妈妈在找你
My mother's been looking for you.

我们今天就要回君临了
We ride for King's Landing today.

出发之前 你得去拜见史塔克公爵和史塔克夫人 向他们表达你的慰问
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.

我的慰问对他们有什么用？
What good will my sympathies do them?

一点用都没有 但这是应尽的礼数
None. But it is expected of you.

大家已经注意到你刻意缺席了
Your absence has already been noted.

那小屁孩算什么东西
The boy means nothing to me.

我可不想去听老女人哭哭啼啼
And I can't stand the wailing of women.

你敢再说一句 我就再赏你一耳光
One word and I'll hit you again.

但首先你给我去拜见史塔克公爵夫妇 我要你在他们面前跪下 说你感到非常遗憾 说你愿意为他们赴汤蹈火 最后还要献上你最虔诚的祝祷 你听懂了没有？
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?

小少爷 王子是不会忘记您刚才的举动的
The prince will remember that, little lord.

哪天要是他忘了 你这条狗可要好好提醒他
If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.

啊哈 该吃早饭了
Ah. Time for breakfast.

我要面包 两条这种小鱼
Bread. And two of those little fish.

再配上一杯上好的黑啤酒
And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.

培根 煎焦一点
And bacon, burned black.

小弟弟 亲爱的老哥老姐
Little brother. Beloved siblings.

布兰会死吗？
Is Bran going to die?

你这话什么意思？ 学士说那孩子活下来的机会很大
What do you mean? The Maester says the boy may live.

老天真残忍 竟让一个年幼的孩子苟延残喘
It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.

这些事本该由诸神定夺
Only the gods know for certain.

我们能做的只是祈祷
All the rest of us can do is pray.

你们似乎对北国风光无动于衷啊
The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.

我仍不相信你要独自行动
I still can't believe you're going.

即便对你 这也太荒唐了
It's ridiculous even for you.

你的好奇心都哪去了？
Where's your sense of wonder?

对世界上最伟大的建筑 最英勇的守夜人战士 最可怕的异鬼巢穴就没有一丝兴趣么？
The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.

别说你想去当黑衣弟兄啦
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.

然后打一辈子光棍？那怎么成 从多恩领到凯岩城 全国的妓女都会抗议的
And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

放心 我不过是想爬上长城 对着世界的边缘洒泡尿罢了
No, I just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world.

别当着孩子们的面说这种粗话
The children don't need to hear your filth.

就算那孩子活下来 也成了跛子 甚至是个畸形怪胎
Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

我宁可干脆利落地去死
Give me a good clean death any day.

畸形怪胎…嘿 不是我多嘴
Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree.

死了就什么都没了 活着嘛…
Death is so final, whereas life...

活着起码充满各种可能
Ah, life is full of possibilities.

我真心希望那孩子活过来
I hope the boy does wake.

我想听听他还知道些什么
I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.

我亲爱的好弟弟 有时候我真不知道你站在哪一边
My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.

我最亲爱的哥哥 你这话好伤我的心
My dear brother, you wound me.

你难道不知我对我家人的感情有多深吗？
You know how much I love my family.

噢 请原谅我不及更衣 陛下
Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.

没关系 你是主我是客
This is your home. I'm your guest.

他真漂亮 是不是？
Handsome one, isn't he?

我夭折的头胎 也是个黑发的漂亮男孩
I lost my first boy, a little blackhaired beauty.

也是个战士… 和带走他的热病斗争到最后
He was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him.

这大概是你现在最不想听的话了
It's the last thing you need to hear right now.

劳勃发狂似地锤墙 直到满手是血 这是男人们表达悲伤的方式
Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care.

我那孩子长得就跟他一模一样
The boy looked just like him.

他那么小…
Such a little thing...

还是一只没长羽毛的雏鸟
A bird without feathers.

他们带走他时 劳勃抱住了我
They came to take his body away and Robert held me.

我尖叫着使劲挣扎 但他死死地抱住了我
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

就这样从我的世界里消失了 我再也没有见过他
They took him away and I never saw him again.

我没有去过墓窖 永远也不会去
Never have visited the crypt, never.

每天早晚 我都向圣母祈祷 祈祷她把孩子送回给你
I pray to the mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.

也许这次她能回应我罢
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

打把好剑去长城？
A sword for the wall?

我已经有一把好剑了 很好
I already have one. Good man.

那你使过它吗？ 当然使过
Have you swung it yet? Of course I have.

头一次砍人的感觉是最难忘的
It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man.

你突然意识到人不过就是 骨头支着的血肉皮囊
You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing.

让我提前跟你道个谢吧 保护芸芸众生免遭长城之外的
Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall

野人 异鬼等各路妖魔鬼怪的侵袭
Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot.

有你这样强壮的好人来牺牲奉献 我们怎能不心怀感激
We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.

我们保护王国都超过八千年了
We've guarded the kingdoms for 8,000 years.

你发过誓吗？
Have you taken your vows then?

请代表我向守夜人军团致敬
Give my regards to The Night's Watch.

在这样的精英部队里服役一定非常刺激
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.

茉丹修女说我没把衣服摺得漂漂亮亮的
Septa Mordane says I have to do it again.

所以得重新来过
My things weren't properly folded, she says.

谁管它们有没有摺好啊？！
Who cares how they're folded?!

反正这些衣服迟早也要乱成一团
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

还好你有帮手嘛
It's good you've got help.

我有样东西给你
I have something for you.

这东西必须妥善地藏好
And it has to be packed very carefully.

小心不要伤到自己
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

它好细啊 跟你一样
It's so skinny. So are you.

我请铁匠特别为你打造的
I had the blacksmith make it for you special.

它虽无法斩人首级 但只要你动作够快 却可以将敌人刺得千疮百孔
It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.

你以后要天天练习
You'll have to work at it every day.

还顺手吗？
Do you like the balance?

第一课：用尖的那端去刺敌人
First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.

我知道该用那一边刺人啦
I know which end to use.

我会想念你的
I'm going to miss you.

你知道 大凡好剑都有自己的名讳
All the best swords have names, you know.

珊莎有她的缝衣针
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

我也有我的“缝衣针”
I've got a needle of my own.

我来向布兰道别
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

我多希望 当你醒来时我能陪在你身边
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

但我这就得随班杨叔叔北上
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

加入黑衣军团
I'm taking the black.

我们总说要一起去看长城 等你好起来了 可以来黑城堡找我
I know we always talked about seeing the wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.

这期间我会加倍努力
I'll know my way around by then.

我会成为一名合格的守夜人弟兄
I'll be a sworn brother of The Night's Watch.

如果你不怕的话 我们甚至可以去长城之外冒险
We can go out walking beyond the wall, if you're not afraid.

十七年前 你不声不响地追随劳勃·拜拉席恩踏上征程
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

一年之后 你带着别的女人的儿子回到我身边
You came back a year later with another woman's son.

现在你又要离开我
And now you're leaving again.

这不过是男人为了荣誉找的借口
That's what men always say when honor calls.

这是他们搪塞家人 搪塞自己的谎话
That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves.

你当然可以选择
You do have a choice.

承受不了… 你得忍耐
I really can't. You can.

你跟布兰道别过了吗？
You've said goodbye to Bran

我知道他不会死
He's not going to die. I know it.

你们史塔克的命的确很硬
You Starks are hard to kill.

她待我很亲切 那就好
She was very kind. Good.

下次碰面 你就全身黑衣黑甲了
Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.

黑色一直很配我
It was always my color.

雪诺 多保重 史塔克 你也一样
Farewell, Snow. And you, Stark.

加入长城守军是至高的荣誉
There's great honor serving in The Night's Watch.

数千年来 史塔克家人前仆后继地守护着北境
The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years.

你没有我的姓 却流着我的血
You might not have my name, but you have my blood.

她知道我的情况吗？她可知我现在何处 又将去往何方？
Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going?

下次相见 咱们就来谈谈你母亲
The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother.

诸神在上 这才叫北国风光！
Gods, this is country!

我真想丢下他们 一路骑下去
I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.

正有此意
I've half a mind to go with you.

就咱俩如何？ 沿着这条国王大道 行侠仗义 晚上便找对儿酒店侍女暖床
What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.

二十年前我或许会考虑
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

当时咱们有仗可打 又都没老婆 现下可没那么风流快活了
There were wars to fight, women to marry we never had the chance to be young.

我倒是想起几桩风流事
I recall a few chances.

那个她…噢 叫什么来着？
There was that one... Oh, what was her name?

跟你一起的平民姑娘
That common girl of yours?

叫蓓卡？就是奶子大得你能把脸埋进去的那个
Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.

蓓茜 她明明是你的老相好
Bessie. She was one of yours.

蓓茜！感谢诸神 为蓓茜 也为她那对奶子
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits.

不对 你跟我提过一次 梅莉儿？
No. You told me once. Meryl?

就你私生子的娘
Your bastard's mother?

她一定不是个简单的姑娘 能让艾德·史塔克公爵忘却荣誉
She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.

你从来没告诉我她生什么样…？
You never told me what she looked like.

过的是朝不保夕的日子
None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.

妈的 你律己太严了 老是这德行
You're too hard on yourself. You always have been.

我发誓我要不是你国王 你刚才就要揍我了
I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.

你戴上王冠之后最操蛋的事
The worst thing about your coronation

就是我不能对你动手
I'll never get to hit you again.

相信我 这不是最操蛋的事
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

昨晚来了个信使
There was a rider in the night.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安刚嫁给一个多斯拉克马王
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.

那又如何？难不成我们该送份贺礼过去？
What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?

我看送把刀更好 一把锐利的好刀 拿在一个有胆量的人手里
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.

她不过是个孩子
She's little more than a child.

这个‘孩子’很快就会张开双腿 繁殖孽种了
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.

你暗示的是令人发指的事 噢 我令人发指？
Tell me we're not speaking of this. Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

她爹对你家人干的那些事 那才叫令人发指
What her father did to your familythat was unspeakable.

还有雷加·坦格利安对你妹妹… 对我心爱的女人干的那些事
What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved.

我要亲手宰掉每一个坦格利安家的人
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

你没法亲手宰掉这一个 对吧？
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?

这个卓戈卡奥 据说他手下有十万大军
This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.

多斯拉克人远在狭海对岸 即便百万大军又有何惧？
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.

劳勃 那些野蛮人没有船
They have no ships, Robert.

到现在王国里还有人叫我‘篡夺者’
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

倘若哪天那坦格利安臭小子带着多斯拉克大军渡海 这批人渣一定会拥护他 他渡不了海
If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him. He will not cross.

就算他真来了 我们也能协力把他赶回去
And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.

风雨欲来啊 奈德
There's a war coming, Ned.

也不清楚我们的对手 但我闻到了战争的味道
I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.

他们的选择…割卵蛋还是守长城
They were given a choice no doubtcastration or the wall.

多数人无疑还是舍不得那话儿
Most choose the knife.

对你的新兄弟们没啥好感？
Not impressed by your new brothers?

别忘了 做守夜人最妙的事 就是可以抛弃旧家庭 换来一批新弟兄呐
Lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one.

你读那么多书干嘛？
Why do you read so much?

看着我 然后告诉我你看到了什么？
Look at me and tell me what you see.

你看到的是个侏儒
What you see is a dwarf.

如果我生在普通农家 早被扔进树林里等死
If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.

我偏又生在凯岩城的兰尼斯特家
Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

众人对我万般期待
Things are expected of me.

你瞧 我爹干了二十年的御前首相…
My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.

你哥哥却把国王杀了
Until your brother killed that King.

是的 我老哥把国王给宰了
Yes, until my brother killed him.

人生就是这样变幻无常
Life is full of these little ironies.

我老姐嫁给了新任国王 我那脾气暴躁的外甥则会继承王位
My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him.

我空担着家族名誉 总得尽点心力罢？
I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree?

呵 老哥有他的宝剑 我则有我的脑袋瓜
Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind.

脑袋需要多读书 好比宝剑需要磨刀石
And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.

琼恩·雪诺 这就是为什么我读个不停啰
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

你的故事又是什么 私生子？
What's your story, bastard?

求我 或许我会讲给你听 侏儒
Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

一个一无所有的私生子小弟 怀着满腔热血 前去加入历史悠久的守夜人军团 途中结识了一帮英勇高尚的好兄弟…
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of The Night's Watch alongside his Valiant brothersinarms.

守夜人是保护王国免遭… 啊 是的是的 免遭古灵精怪 以及你奶妈告诉你的各种妖怪侵袭的惟一屏障
The Night's Watch protects the realm from ah, yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.

怎会相信这种屁话？
You don't believe that nonsense.

喝饱一肚子酒 感觉就舒坦了
Everything's better with some wine in the belly.

夫人 我们该清点帐目了
It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.

这样您才知道这次招待王室的开销
You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.

这些事找普尔说去
Talk to Poole about it.

普尔随史塔克大人南下了 夫人
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.

我们需要一位新总管 还有好些职务需要我们立刻决… 立刻决… 你觉得我在乎什么职务安排吗！
We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attentionI don't care about appointments!

我来安排
I'll make the appointments.

我们明早首先处理这事
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

您有多久没踏出这房间了？
When was the last time you left this room?

我得照顾他…
I have to take care of him.

母亲 他不会死的
He's not going to die, mother.

鲁温师傅说危险期已经过了
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.

布兰需要我 瑞肯需要您
Bran needs me. Rickon needs you.

根本搞不清事态 所以成天跟着我 抱着我大腿又哭又闹… 关上窗子罢！
He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, cryingclose the windows!

我受不了！他们别叫了！
I can't stand it! Please make them stop!

您留在这 我很快就回来
You stay here. I'll come back.

你不该在这儿
You're not supposed to be here.

这里不该有人
No one is supposed to be here.

这是为他好 反正他跟死人没两样
It's a mercy. He's dead already.

你们见过龙吗？卡丽熙 龙已经绝迹啦
Have you ever seen a dragon? Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

到处都一样？连东方也是？
Everywhere? Even in the east?

没有龙了 勇士们把龙都杀光了
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

大家都知道 大家都知道
It is known. It is known.

有个魁尔斯商人跟我说龙是从月亮里钻出来的
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.

他告诉我月亮是颗蛋 卡丽熙 天上原本有两个月亮
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky.

但其中一个运行得太靠近太阳 受不住高热 就爆炸了
But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

成千上万只龙从中涌出 他们吸收了太阳的火焰
Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.

月亮是女神 太阳的妻子
Moon is goddesswife of sun.

大家都知道 大家都知道
It is known. It is known.

魁尔斯商人干嘛跟你说这些？
Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?

男人开心起来话就多呗
Men like to talk when they're happy.

你哥哥把我买下给你之前 我天天哄男人开心
Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.

你干了几年？ 我九岁那年 就被母亲卖去妓院
How old were you? I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.

最初的三年我并没有接客 卡丽熙
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.

首先 必须学会取悦他们的办法
First you must learn.

你能教我如何取悦卡奥吗？
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?

当然可以 我也需要学上三年吗？
Yes. Will it take three years?

我告诉你们的事 绝不许外传
What I am about to tell you must remain between us.

我认为布兰绝非失足坠楼
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

而是被抛下去的
I think he was thrown.

这孩子以前从没出过事
The boy was always surefooted before.

有人对他连下两次毒手
Someone tried to kill him twice.

这是为什么？为什么要残害一个无辜幼儿？
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

除非是他看见了不该看见的事
Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.

看见了什么 夫人？ 我也不清楚
Saw what, my lady? I don't know.

但我敢以性命打赌 兰尼斯特家族脱不了干系
But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.

之前我们就有理由怀疑他们对王室的忠诚了
We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

您是否注意到刺客行凶用的匕首？
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

以他的地位不足以使用这么精良的武器
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

刀刃是瓦雷利亚钢打造 刀柄的材质是龙骨
The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.

一定是有人交给他的
Someone gave it to him.

他们来我家做客 竟敢图谋我弟弟？
They come into our home and try to murder my brother?

如果他们想要开战…
If it's war they want

倘若真有战事 我会与你并肩作战
If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.

怎么 你们要在神木林里宣战吗？
What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?

成何体统 开战之事岂可妄言
Too easily words of war become acts of war.

况且我们尚未查明真相
We don't know the truth yet.

此事必须报告史塔克大人
Lord Stark must be told of this.

这种事我不放心乌鸦传信
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.

我去君临走一趟 不行
I'll ride to King's Landing. No.

无论如何 临冬城都要有史塔克家的人当家
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

我自己去 母亲 您不能走
I will go myself. Mother, you can't.

我叫哈尔带一队守卫随您去
I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.

大队人马只会惹来不必要的注意
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

我不希望兰尼斯特家知道我南下的消息
I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.

起码让我跟您一道去
Let me accompany you at least.

国王大道对一个女人家来说太危险
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.

我已经为他向天上的七神祈祷了一个多月
I have prayed to the seven for more than a month.

他的性命就交给他们吧
Bran's life is in their hands now.

您必须看着他的眼睛
You must look in his eyes always.

眼睛是心灵的窗户 爱的窗户
Love comes in at the eyes.

据说里斯的爱格娜仅凭那对明眸 就足以消化男人
It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.

君王们为她万里跋涉
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia.

总督们为她变卖华美宫殿
Magisters sold their palaces.

卡奥们为她屠城灭国…只为了换得片刻春宵销魂
Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.

据说有上千人向她求过婚 她却一个也不要
They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.

好吧 听起来倒是个有趣的女人
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman.

我…我认为 卓戈不会喜欢我在他上面
II don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.

那您就该让他喜欢 卡丽熙
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

男人都爱尝鲜
Men want what they've never had.

多斯拉克人像公狗骑母狗那样骑他们的奴隶
And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.

您是奴隶吗 卡丽熙？
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

那就别像奴隶一样交欢
Then don't make love like a slave.

在帐篷外 他是高高在上的卡奥 但在帐篷里 您才是他的主宰
Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.

我…我认为 这不是多斯拉克人的方式
II don't think that this is the Dothraki way.

如果他只想遵循多斯拉克人的方式 又何必娶你呢？
If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?

今晚我要看着你的脸
Tonight I would look upon your face.

我有这么可怕么 小妹妹？
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

还是他让你发抖？
Or is it him there making you shake?

如果冒犯了您 我道歉 爵士先生
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.

为何他不愿跟我说话？
Why won't he speak to me?

“疯王”叫人用烧红的钳子把他舌头给拔了
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.

他这二十年来都不爱讲话
Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.

如今他改用剑说话
He speaks damn well with his sword though.

他就是伊林·派恩爵士 御前执法官
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.

王家刽子手
The royal executioner.

亲爱的小姐 你怎么了？
What is it, sweet lady?

是不是因为这只狗？
Does the hound frighten you?

你吓到我的小姐了
You're scaring my lady.

我要你高高兴兴地
I don't like to see you upset.

今天终于放晴了
The Sun is finally shining.

或许我不该再喝了
I probably shouldn't have any more.

父亲大人只准我们在宴会上喝一杯
Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.

我的公主爱喝多少就喝多少
My princess can drink as much as she wants.

别担心…有我在你不用怕
Don't worryyou're safe with me.

你们来这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

走开 你妹妹？
Go away. Your sister?

小子 你又是谁？米凯 大人
And who are you, boy? Mycah, my Lord.

他是屠夫的学徒 他是我朋友
He the butcher's boy. He's my friend.

杀猪的也想当骑士 是吗？
A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh?

屠夫小弟 把剑捡起来 咱们来瞧瞧你够不够格
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.

是她逼我的 大人 是她逼我这么做的
She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.

我是你的王子殿下 不是什么大人 我命令你把剑捡起来
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.

殿下 这不是剑 只是根棍子罢了
It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.

正如你也不过是个杀猪的
And you're not a Knight.

根本不是骑士
Only a butcher's boy.

你打的是我这位小姐的妹妹 你知不知道
That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?

住手！ 艾莉亚 你别插手！
Stop it! Arya, stay out of this.

住手 住手 不要打了！你们两个都住手！
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you.

你们把事情搞砸了 都搞砸了！
You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!

我劈死你 不要脸的烂货！
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

艾莉亚 你别欺负他！
Arya, leave him alone.

我的王子 我可怜的王子 看看她们做了什么好事
My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.

躺着别动 我这就回旅店 找人来帮忙
Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.

那只狼不在这儿 去溪边找找
The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.

你走罢 他们会为了乔佛里的事杀你的
You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.

那可是只冰原狼 我去下面搜
It's a direwolf. I'll check down here.

我听到什么动静
I think I heard a noise.

陛下！找到她了
My lord! They found her.

她被直接带到国王那里去了
She's been taken directly before the King.

谁带她去的？ 兰尼斯特家的人
Who took her? The Lannisters found her.

艾莉亚！ 好 我们赶紧回去
Aryaaa! Right, get back.

王后的命令是将她直接带到国王面前
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.

回去！回旅店
Back! Back to the inn.

对不起 对不起 对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

你这是什么意思？
What is the meaning of this?

找到我女儿为什么不第一时间通知我？
Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?

你竟敢用这种口气对国王说话！
How dare you speak to your King in that manner?

奈德 不好意思 我没有吓她的意思
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

但这桩事早点了结比较好
But we need to get this business done quickly.

你这野丫头和那杀猪的联手攻击我儿子
Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.

她那只野狼差点就咬断他一条胳膊
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

她只…只咬了他一下下
She just... Bit him a little.

而且是因为他先欺负米凯 小乔把事情经过都告诉我们了
He was hurting Mycah. Joff told us what happened.

你和那学徒一边用棍子打他 一边放狼咬他 事情不是这样的！
You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him. That's not what happened!

他们一起围攻我 她还把我的剑丢进河里
They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.

他说的是一回事 她说的却完全是另一回事
He tells me one thing, she tells me another.

七层地狱！你叫我怎么办？
Seven hells! What am I to make of this?

你的大女儿在哪儿 奈德？
Where's your other daughter, Ned?

珊莎 请上前来 亲爱的
Sansa, come here, darling.

告诉我们究竟是怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

原原本本地说 老老实实地讲
Tell it all and tell it true.

欺骗国王可是滔天大罪
It's a great crime to lie to a King.

我不记得了 事情发生得好快
I don't remember. Everything happened so fast.

骗子！骗子！ 艾莉亚！
Liar liar liar! Arya!

嘿！快住手！够了！ 骗子！骗子！
Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. Liar liar liar!

艾莉亚！住手！ 这丫头跟她那只脏东西一个野德行
Stop! Arya! She's as wild as that animal of hers.

你要我怎么办？打她几鞭游街示众吗？
What would you have me do, whip her through the streets?

该死 不过就是小孩打架 现在没事了
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

乔佛里手上一辈子都会留着疤痕
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.

一个小丫头就把你缴了械？
You let that little girl disarm you?

奈德 好好管教你女儿
Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined.

我也会好好管教我儿子 国王陛下 我乐意之至
I'll do the same with my son. Gladly, your Grace.

那只冰原狼又该怎么办？
And what of the direwolf?

那只欺辱你儿子的禽兽该如何处置？
What of the beast that savaged your son?

我倒是把那头该死的狼给忘了
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

陛下 那只狼一点影子都没有
We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.

我们还有一只狼
We have another wolf.

你不是说真的吧？ 冰原狼不是宠物
You can't mean it. A direwolf's no pet.

帮她弄条狗 她会快乐点
Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.

他不是说淑女吧 是不是？
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

不 不！不要碰淑女！淑女不咬人的！
No no, not lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!

她最乖… 淑女根本不在场！
She's good! Lady wasn't there!

你们不要欺负她！ 叫他们住手 不是这样的
You leave her alone! Stop them. Don't let them do it.

求求你 求求你…咬人的不是淑女！
Please please, it wasn't Lady!

这是你的旨意吗… 陛下？
Is this your command your Grace?

那只野兽在哪里？ 被拴在门外 陛下
Where is the beast? Chained up outside, your Grace.

伊林爵士 请你替…
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

带女孩们回房去
Take the girls to their rooms.

假如她非死不可 我要亲自动手
If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.

她来自北方
The wolf is of the north.

死也不能死在屠夫手里
She deserves better than a butcher.

这是那个屠夫学徒… 你骑马追杀他？
The butcher's boy you rode him down?

派席尔大学士刚刚召集御前会议
Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council.

恭请您大驾光临
The honor of your presence is requested.

好好安顿我女儿 我会回来吃晚饭
Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper.

乔里 帮我看好他们 是 大人
And, Jory, you go with them. Yes, my Lord.

您是否要换上更合适的衣服进宫…
If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...

谢天谢地 你终于到了 史塔克
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

朝廷是该找个严厉的北方人来整顿作风了
About time we had some stern, northern leadership.

你这算是在履行职责 保护王座么
About glad to see you're protecting the throne.

我正在想 它究竟被多少国王的屁股磨过
How many Kings' asses have polished it, I wonder?

国王拉屎 首相收拾
The King shits and The Hand wipes.

连一道划痕都没有 是啊
Not a scratch on it. I know.

无数人冲我身上招呼 可惜都碰不着
People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.

这只能说明你善于挑选对手
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

算是优点之一吧
I have a knack for it.

在这个大厅里 你的心情一定很复杂吧？
It must be strange for you coming into this room.

那件事发生时 我就站在这里
I was standing right here when it happened.

他们很勇敢 我是指 你哥哥
He was very brave, your brother.

他们不该那样死去
They didn't deserve to die like that.

谁也不该那样死去
Nobody deserves to die like that.

而你只是袖手旁观
But you just stood there and watched.

五百人站在这里袖手旁观
500 men just stood there and watched.

七大王国最有权势的贵族和骑士 你以为他们说过一句话 动过一根指头？
All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms you think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

这个站满了五百人的大厅跟墓窖一样沉寂
500 men and this room was silent as a crypt.

当然 除了惨叫以外 还有疯王的笑声
Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing.

后来 当我看着疯王死去时
And later...  when I watched the Mad King die,

我想起了他烧你父亲时的笑声…
I remembered him laughing as your father burned...

那有一丝正义的滋味
It felt like justice.

这就是你每晚讲给自己的睡前故事？
Is that what you tell yourself at night?

你是正义的使者？
You're a servant of justice?

你在疯王背后捅刀子 是为了给我父亲报仇？
That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

告诉我… 如果我向他当面挑战而不是“背后捅刀子” 你会更佩服我吗？
Tell me if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?

你真是他忠勇的卫士 只在不危及自身的时候
You served him well when serving was safe.

我听说了您在国王大道上遇到的麻烦事儿
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.

我们都在祈祷乔佛里王子能早日康复
We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

你们应该为屠夫的学徒祈祷
A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son.

蓝礼！你气色不错
Renly! You're looking well.

您看起来却一脸倦容
And you look tired from the road.

我本想让他们把会议推迟到明天 可…
I told them this meeting could wait another day, but

可我们应该以国事为先
But we have a Kingdom to look after.

史塔克大人 这些年来我一直想见您
I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark.

凯特琳夫人应该向您提起过我吧？
No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.

她是提过 贝里席大人
She has, Lord Baelish.

如果我没记错 你也认识我哥哥布兰登
I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.

我跟他很熟 至今身上都还留着他的纪念 从肚脐到锁骨
All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.

或许是你选错了决斗对象
Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.

我选的对象可不是他 大人
It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord.

我选的是凯特琳·徒利
It was Catelyn Tully.

一个值得男人拼搏的女人 相信您也同意
A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.

不好意思打断您 史塔克大人
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

多少年过去啦？
How many years has it been?

当初您还年轻 当初您还在辅佐另一位国王
You were a young man. And you served another King.

噢 我真健忘
Oh, how forgetful of me.

这个是您的了
This belongs to you, now.

不等国王吗？ 只怕等到凛冬降临之时 我老哥也不会赏脸现身
Without the King? Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.

陛下有太多事情需要操心
His Grace has many cares.

所以便将鸡毛蒜皮小事交给我们 以减轻负担
He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.

我们就是传说中的御前杂务会
We are the Lords of Small Matters here.

我老哥指示我们举办盛大的比武竞技 以庆祝史塔克大人出任首相
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.

优胜者赏四万金龙币
40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

居次者赏两万金龙币
20,000 to the runnerup,

射箭优胜也是两万
20,000 to the winning archer.

国库出得起这笔钱？
Can the treasury bear such expense?

还不是得伸手借
I'll have to borrow it.

想必兰尼斯特家会很乐意援手
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.

反正已经欠了泰温大人三百万金龙
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.

再借个八万算什么？
What's another 80,000?

你说王室负债高达‘三百万’金币？
Are you telling me the crown is three million in debt?

目前王室负债总额超过六百万
I'm telling you the crown is six million in debt.

你怎么会让国库沦落到这般地步？
How could you let this happen?

财政大臣只管找钱
The Master of Coin finds the money.

花钱的是国王和首相
The King and The Hand spend it.

琼恩·艾林绝不会允许劳勃 把国家搞破产
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

艾林大人固然精打细算 但恐怕国王陛下 不见得都听从睿智的谏言 我老哥最讨厌所谓的‘数铜板’
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear his Grace doesn't always listen. 'Counting coppers,' he calls it.

我明天就去跟陛下谈
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

这么铺张浪费的比赛 国家可负担不起
This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.

谈谈当然好 不过我们还是先着手订个计划吧
As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.

在我跟劳勃交涉之前 统统搁下来
There will be no plans until I speak to Robert.

诸位大人 请原谅 我…
Forgive me, my Lords. I'm

我长途跋涉 实在是累了 史塔克大人
I had a long ride. You are The King's Hand,

您是国王的首相 为您效劳是我们职责所在
Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.

噢！ 忍着点 就快好了
Ow! Please, it's nearly healed.

这丑死了 伤疤是王者的证明 你打败了一只冰原狼 你是你父亲一样的勇士
It's ugly. A King should have scars you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.

不 我跟他不一样 我没打败任何东西
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.

他咬我 我只会尖叫
It bit me and all I did was scream.

这事两个史塔克妞都看见了
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

这并非事实 事实是你杀了那野兽
That's not true. You killed the beast.

念着父辈的交情才饶了那两个丫头
You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father.

伊里斯·坦格利安在位时 你父亲不过是个反贼 叛徒
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor.

有朝一日你也会坐上铁王座 到时候你怎么说 历史就怎么写
Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.

我非娶她不可吗？
Do I have to marry her?

她那么年轻貌美
She's very beautiful and young.

你若不喜欢她 只需在重大场合把她牵出来溜溜 等时机成熟 再跟她造几位小王子 小公主
If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses.

你想搞浓妆艳抹的妓女 就去搞浓妆艳抹的妓女
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores.

你中意名门闺秀 就去找名门闺秀
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.

我的宝贝儿子 你是这世界的主人 世界将围绕你旋转
You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.

但你要向那史塔克女孩献献殷勤
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

我不想 你不想 但你得这么做
I don't want to. No, but you will.

在王者之路上 小恩小惠会为你扫清许多障碍
The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.

太纵容那些北方佬了
We allow the Northerners too much power.

他们自以为能跟我们平起平坐
They consider themselves our equals.

那你想怎么处理呢？
How would you handle them?

我要把他们的赋税加倍 再命令他们交出一万名壮丁以组建王家军队
I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the Royal Army.

凭什么每个领主都有权带兵？
Why should every lord command his own men?

这太原始了 跟山上的原住民有什么区别？
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

我们应该建立一支忠于王室的常备军 由久经沙场的老兵训练 而不是临到头来征集一帮从没摸过刀枪的农民
We should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown, trained by experienced soldiers instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.

如果北方人不愿纳税交人呢？
And if the Northerners rebel?

我要攻占临冬城 任命一位大忠臣来当北境守护 比如凯冯舅公
Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.

你觉得这一万北方精锐 到时候是为你而战还是支持自己的领主呢？
And these 10,000 Northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?

当然是为我！我是他们的国王
For me. I'm their King.

可你是在侵略他们的家园 你还要他们同室操戈 我不是要求他们 是…
But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers. I'm not asking.

一个外来人可以征服北境 却无法保住北境
The North cannot be heldnot by an outsider.

它过于辽阔 又桀骜不驯 当北境的冬天到来时 恐怕七神加在一起也无法挽救你和你的王家军队
It's too big and too wild. And when the winter comes, the Seven Gods together couldn't save you and your royal army.

真正的王者懂得何时蓄势
A good King knows when to save his strength...

何时克敌
And when to destroy his enemies.

你也同意史塔克是敌人？
The Starks are enemies?

那当然了 非我族类 其心必异
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

别敲了 小姐 赶紧吃东西
Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.

我在练习 练什么
I'm practicing. Practicing for what?

练怎么杀王子 艾莉亚 你给我停下！
The Prince. Arya, stop!

他是个骗子 懦夫 他杀了我朋友
He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.

杀你朋友的是猎狗
The Hound killed your friend.

去！王子怎么吩咐 猎狗就怎么做
The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.

你个骗子 如果你肯说实话
You're a liar, and if you told the truth

米凯就不会死了 够了！
Mycah would be alive. Enough!

怎么回事？
What's happening here?

艾莉亚太放肆了 没一点淑女样子
Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.

回房去 我待会儿找你谈
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

给你 亲爱的
That's for you, love.

弥赛菈公主的玩具都是这位师傅做的
The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

八岁起我就不玩娃娃了
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.

我可以先告退吗? 可你的东西几乎都没吃
May I be excused? You've barely eaten a thing.

没事 你去吧
It's all right. Go on.

养闺女比打仗还难哪
War was easier than daughters.

这把剑是谁的？ 我的
Whose sword is that? Mine.

我认得铸剑人的记号 这是密肯打的
I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work.

你怎么弄到这把剑的？
Where did you get this?

小淑女是不该玩剑的
Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.

而且我不想变成淑女
And I don't want to be a lady.

你要它来做什么？
Now what do you want with this?

啊 它还有名字…
Oh, a blade with a name.

你想拿这缝衣针来对付谁？
And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle?

你知道剑道的第一课是什么？
Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?

用尖的那端去刺敌人
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

这的确是剑术的精髓
That's the essence of it.

我想好好学
I was trying to learn.

我要米凯陪我练
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

都是我的错 别这样 我亲爱的孩子
It was my fault. No, sweet girl.

不 不 屠夫小弟不是你害的
No no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

我恨他们！我恨死他们了！
I hate them! I hate all of them.

我恨猎狗 恨王后 恨国王 还有乔佛里和珊莎
The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.

珊莎是被拖到国王和王后面前的…
Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen...

你希望她指证王子？
And asked to call the Prince a liar.

我还不是被拖去的！而且他本来就是个大骗子！
So was I! He is a liar.

嘘 宝贝 听我说
Shh, darling, listen to me.

珊莎跟乔佛里订过婚
Sansa will be married to Joffrey's someday.

她不能出卖未来的夫婿
She cannot betray him.

即便他有千般不对 她也得站在他那边
She must take his side even when he's wrong.

可你怎能让她嫁给这种人？
But how you can let her marry someone like that?

作为临冬城史塔克家族的一份子 你知道我们的族语
You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.

你生于漫长的盛夏时节
You were born in the long summer.

还未经历其他季节
You've never known anything else.

现在冬天真的要来了
But now winter is truly coming.

在冬天 我们必须保卫彼此 相互温暖 共享力量 珊莎她再怎么说也是你姐姐
And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.

我并非有意吓你 然而我也不想骗你
I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either.

我们来到了一个危险的地方
We've come to a dangerous place.

我们不能自相残杀
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

别拿剑刺你姐姐就好
Try not to stab your sister with it.

你想留着它 就得学会怎么用它
If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.

别听它叫唤 乌鸦就会说谎
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

我知道一个乌鸦的故事 我讨厌你那些故事
I know a story about a crow. I hete your stories.

我知道有个故事是讲讨厌听故事的小男孩
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.

我来说说“高个”邓肯爵士的故事吧
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the tall.

你最喜欢这个故事了
Those were always your favorites.

我最喜欢的才不是这个
Those weren't my favorites.

我喜欢的是那些吓人的
My favorites were the scary ones.

噢 我亲爱的孩子啊 你出生在夏季 哪里懂得真正的恐惧？
Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear?

当冬天来临 积雪百尺
Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

当长夜漫漫 终年不见天日 小孩生于黑夜 长于黑夜 死于黑夜
Fear is for the long night, when the Sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness.

当异鬼穿梭林间 那才是恐惧降临之时 小少爷
That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods.

几千年前 在一个长达一代人的长夜里
Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation.

城中的国王 和茅屋里的羊倌同样颤抖着被冻死
Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the Shepherds in their huts.

母亲们宁可闷死自己的孩子 也不愿见他们挨饿受冻 她们放声大哭 眼泪却冻结在脸颊上
And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.

你喜欢听的就是这种故事？
So is this the sort of story that you like?

在一片黑暗中 异鬼首度降临人间
In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time.

他们横扫城市和王国 骑着死马 带着大如猎狗的白蜘蛛四处狩猎…
They swept through cities and Kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as Hounds

你在给他说什么呢?
What are you telling him now?

说小少爷爱听的故事啊
Only what what the little lord telling wants to hear.

去用晚餐吧 我想和他独处一会儿
Get your supper. I want some time with him.

从前她跟我讲 天空之所以是蓝色的 全因我们住在蓝眼巨人马克比的眼睛里
One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant named Macomber.

还是什么也不记得？
You still don't remember anything?

我见你爬过上千回了
I've seen you climb a thousand times.

在风中 在雨中… 上千回地爬
In the wind, in the rain a thousand times.

你从没失足 可我确实摔下来了
You never fall. I did though.

是真的 是不是？ 鲁温师傅说我的腿…
It's true, isn't it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

永远不要说这种话 我宁愿去死
Don't ever say that. I'd rather be dead.

由这道门进出的人比较少 夫人
Fewer eyes back here, my Lady.

我已经阔别都城九年了
It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital.

即便九年前也没几个人知道我是谁
And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.

欢迎来到君临 史塔克夫人 可否随我们走一趟？
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?

为什么？我们没犯什么事啊
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

我们奉命护送您进城
We've been instructed to escort you into the city.

奉谁的命？这是… 请随我来 史塔克夫人
I don't know who's providing your instructions, but follow me, Lady Stark.

当我是暗巷里的婊子吗？ 你竟敢把我带到… 去去！
You take me for some backalley Sally you can drag into a pssst!

我没有不敬之意 尤其是对你
I meant no disrespect to you of all people.

你竟敢把我带到这种地方！
How dare you bring me here!

你疯了不成？
Have you lost your mind?

没人会上这儿来找你 这不正是你所期望的吗？
No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what you wanted?

安排在此地见面我表示歉意
I'm truly sorry about the locale.

你怎么知道我来了君临？
How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?

一位好朋友告诉我的
A dear friend told me.

史塔克夫人 瓦里斯伯爵
Lady Stark. Lord Varys.

阔别多年 今日相见真是令人欢欣鼓舞
To see you again after so many years is a blessing.

你怎会知道我来了？
How did you know I was coming?

我的职责便是打听消息啊 好夫人
Knowledge is my trade, my Lady.

我在想 您是否把那把匕首也带来啦？
Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?

我的小小鸟儿无处不在
My little birds are everywhere...

他们也给我传回来了
They whisper to me the strangest stories.

你知道匕首的主人是谁？
Do you know whose dagger this is?

毫无头绪
I must admit I do not.

哈哈 这真是历史性的一刻
Well well, this is an historic day.

我居然会知道 你不知道的事情
Something you don't know that I do.

放眼七大王国 这匕首只有一把
There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

直到乔佛里王子命名日那天的比武大会为止
At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last Nameday.

我和所有有常识的人一样 赌詹姆爵士会赢得长枪比试
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would.

所以当百花骑士把他刺下马时
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,

葛兰 让他见识见识农民的本事
Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of.

如果是真剑 你早没命了
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

咱们的雪诺大人可是长在城堡里 你们只配被他唾弃
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you.

你认为奈德·史塔克的野种 会跟你们一样流血吗？
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?

好吧 雪诺大人 看来你是这帮饭桶里最结实的一个
Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here.

去把自己收拾干净
Go clean yourselves up.

我今天已经看够了
There's only so much I can stomach in a day.

他有没有魅力不重要
I don't need him to be charming.

他能不能将这帮窃贼逃犯 训练成守夜人军团的汉子才是关键
I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of The Night's Watch.

那他进展如何呢 莫尔蒙司令？
And how's that going, commander Mormont?

有信鸦 带来奈德·史塔克儿子的消息
A raven came for Ned Stark's son.

我本想早点给你的
I meant to give you this earlier.

最近忘性太大
So forgetful these days.

今天早上有信鸦从临冬城飞来
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

或许您想与夫人分享吧？
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?

我夫人人在临冬城 是吗？
My wife is in Winterfell. Is she?

是你 我看的就是你
Yes, I'm looking at you.

这家店恰好是由我经营
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

你老婆在这里最安全
One of several such establishments I own.

嗯？你觉得很好笑是不是？
Huh? A very funny man.

啊 这帮姓史塔克的… 爆脾气 死脑筋
Ah, the Starks quick tempers, slow minds.

小杂种 你打破了我的鼻子！
You broke my nose, bastard!

把你从长城上扔下去 要多久才会着地呢？
If we threw you over The Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

我怀疑他们能不能在野狼光顾前找到你的尸体
I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.

你看什么看 半人？
What're you looking at, half man?

你的脸很有特点
You've got an interesting face.

嗯 令人过目难忘
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

我们长什么样关你屁事？
And what do you care about our faces?

把这么几颗有特点的脑袋插在枪上 来装饰君临的城门挺不错
It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing.

或许我该写信给我老姐 跟她分享这个点子
Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.

我们走着瞧 雪诺大人
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

大家都知道这是个什么地方 但没人告诉我真相
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me.

我父亲肯定知情 却仍然把我送来自生自灭
My father knew and he left me to rot at The Wall all the same.

葛兰的父亲
Grenn's father left him too...

在他三岁那年就把他丢到了农场外面
Outside a farmhouse when he was three.

派普不过偷了一轮奶酪
Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.

她老妹当时三天没吃饭了
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

他不想失去右手的话 就得来长城充军
He was given a choice: His right hand or The Wall.

我这两天都在跟总司令聊他们的故事
I've been asking the lord commander about them.

他们恨我 因为我比他们优秀
They hate me because I'm better than they are.

你很幸运 因为他们都没机会 接受临冬城教头罗德利克爵士的训练
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a MasteratArms like your Ser Rodrik.

我甚至敢断言 来这里之前 他们都没握过真剑
I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here.

哪怕只是暗示王后的弟弟涉嫌谋害你儿子 便已构成叛国罪
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.

我们有证据 我们有这把匕首
We have proof. We have the blade.

提利昂大人肯定会辩称匕首是被偷的
Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.

托你儿子那只狼的福 惟一能戳穿他的人被咬断了喉咙
The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.

培提尔答应协助我们调查真相
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.

他就像我失散多年的弟弟 奈德
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.

他不会辜负我的信任
He would never betray my trust.

为着她的缘故 我会尽量不让你送命
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

说来只有笨蛋才会这么做 但我就是没法拒绝你老婆的任何请求
A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.

你是一个真正的朋友
You're a true friend.

这话你可千万别告诉他人 免得我辛苦建立的名声毁于一旦
Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.

你怎能如此愚蠢？ 冷静点
How could you be so stupid? Calm down.

他是个孩子 他才十岁
He's a child10 years old.

你当时想什么呢？ 想咱俩啊
What were you thinking? I was thinking of us.

况且你现在抱怨怕是太迟了吧
You're a bit late to start complaining about it now.

那男孩到底说了什么？ 什么也没说
What has the boy told them? Nothing.

他什么也不记得了
He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.

那你吵什么吵？
Then what are you raving about?

万一他想起来了呢？
What if it comes back to him?

如果他把当时的情景告诉他父亲… 我们就说他在发梦 在骗人
If he tells his father what he saw we'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming.

我们怎么说都行
We'll say whatever we like.

还怕一个十岁孩子不成
I think we can outfox a 10yearold.

你有没有想过我丈夫？ 他么 必要时我跟他拼命
And my husband? I'll go to war with him if I have to.

歌手们说不定会写首歌
They can write a ballad about us:

《瑟曦的阴道之战》
'The War for Cersei's Cunt.'

如果他说出去 我就先宰了他
And if he does, I'll kill him.

再干掉奈德·史塔克 国王…把他们杀干净 直到天底下 只剩你和我
Him, Ned Stark, the kingthe whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.

我本想见见女儿们
I wish I could see the girls.

太冒险了 就看一眼…
It's too dangerous. Just for a moment.

等我们弄清敌人是谁再说吧
Until we know who our enemies are

肯定是他们干的 奈德 是兰尼斯特
I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters.

我打骨子里知道是他们干的
In my bones, I know it.

小指头有一点说得对
Littlefinger's right.

没有证据 我什么也做不了
I can't do anything without proof.

等你找到了证据…
And if you find the proof?

我将晋见劳勃
Then I bring it to Robert...

并期望他仍保有往日的英明
And hope he's still the man I once knew.

路上当心 嗯？
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

你脾气不好
That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.

我脾气不好？诸神在上 是谁昨天差点错杀可怜的小指头？
My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.

啊 过了这么多年
Yes, it's been a long time.

但每一张脸我都记得
But I still remember every face.

你记得你杀的第一个人吗?
You remember your first?

记得 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

没问过名字
Never learned the name.

一枪穿心
Lance through the heart.

我第一次杀人是在盛夏厅之战 对方是塔利家的小子
Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.

我的坐骑中箭 所以我徒步作战 蹚着泥浆蹒跚前进
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud.

这不开眼的名门之子 就这么直挺挺地朝我冲来 满以为可以凭借手中长剑 一举终结叛乱
He came running at me, this dumb highborn lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with single swing of his sword.

我用战锤把他撂下马来
I knocked him down with the hammer.

诸神在上 我当年可真壮！
Gods, I was strong then.

那一锤砸扁了他的胸甲
Caved in his breastplate.

大概把他每一根肋骨都打断了
Probably shattered every rib he had.

我踩在他身上 抡起锤子
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

就听他大喊：“等等！”
Right before I brought it down he shouted, 'wait!

唱歌的从来不说将死之人是怎么被吓得屎尿齐流
They never tell you how they all shit themselves.

歌谣里也不会把这些写进去
They don't put that part in the songs.

后来塔利家族和其他人一样 屈膝称臣
Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.

他应该和那些聪明的孩子一起 远远地躲在战场边缘 今天他才有资本嫌弃自己臭脾气的老婆 和忘本的孩子 每天夜里起来三遍 找把夜壶撒尿 倒酒！
He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine!

蓝赛尔 诸神在上 好个蠢名字
Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name.

哪个大舌头替你取的？太他妈蠢了！
Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter?

酒壶空了 陛下 什么叫空了？
It's empty, Your Grace. What do you mean it's empty?

里面没有酒了 这就叫空了？
There's no more wine. Is that what empty means?

顺便把你堂哥给我叫进来
Tell your cousin to get in here.

身边净他妈是些兰尼斯特
Surrounded by Lannisters.

合上眼睛看见的还是他们的金发 和那自鸣得意的傲慢嘴脸
Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces.

干这活儿伤你自尊了吧？
It must wound your pride, huh?

好一副气宇轩昂的风采…
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.

詹姆·兰尼斯特 伟大的泰温之子…
Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin...

他的国王在里面吃喝拉撒玩女人 他却在外头看着一扇傻不拉叽的房门
Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

我们在聊打仗的事
We're telling war stories.

除了老弱病残 你杀的第一个人是谁?
Who was your first kill, not counting old men?

是一名御林兄弟会的土匪
One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.

那天我在场
I was there that day.

你才十六岁 是个侍从
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

而你用一招回旋剑结果了西蒙·托因
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.

我没见过那么漂亮的招式
Best move I ever saw.

托因是个好战士 可惜他体力不支
A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.

没有 我一剑砍了他脑袋
I cut his head off, so no.

那伊里斯·坦格利安呢？
What about Aerys Targaryen?

被你背后捅刀的疯王有什么遗言？
What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back?

他有没有骂你是叛徒？
Did he call you a traitor?

有没有求你饶命啊？
Did he plead for a reprieve?

他念叨着他念叨了一整天的话…
He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours...

如果没事了 陛下…
If that's all, Your Grace...

多斯拉克人的奴隶是买来的吗？
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

多斯拉克人没有金钱观念
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

大多数奴隶是当礼物送给他们的
Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.

谁送的？ 作为城邦统治者 当马上民族来袭时 有两个选择：
From whom? If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices:

要么进贡 要么拼命
Pay tribute or fight.

答案显而易见
An easy choice for most.

当然 不是进贡就万事大吉
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

有时卡奥们觉得献上的奴隶太少 令他蒙羞
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given.

或者男奴太弱 女奴太丑
He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly.

有时卡奥们认为麾下的骑马战士好久没开杀戒了 需要满足欲望
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.

叫他们全部停下
Tell them all to stop.

你要整个部落停下？
You want the entire horde to stop?

直到我下令为止
Until I command them otherwise.

你说话越来越像个公主了
You're learning to talk like a Queen.

你竟敢命令我？命令我？
You give commands to me? To me?

你竟敢对真龙之子颐指气使 我可是七国之君
You do not command the Dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

蛮子和蛮子的小贱货没资格命令我 你听见了没有？
I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?

您要他的命吗？卡莉熙
Do you want him dead khaleesi?

卡丽熙 拉卡洛问您是否要他死
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

割他一只耳朵才能让他听得进话
Maybe the ear will listen if it is removed from the head.

拉卡洛认为您应该割他一只耳朵给他一个教训
Rakharo say you should take ear,to teach respect.

别伤害他 请别伤害他
Please please, don't hurt him.

跟他说我不希望我哥哥受伤害
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

卡莉熙不愿他受到伤害
Khaleesi does not want him harmed.

莫尔蒙！把这些多斯拉克狗杀了！
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

回去跟卡拉萨汇合吧 卡丽熙？
Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?

我想在这陪你看第一眼
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.

我破晓时就要走了 你要走？
I'm leaving this morning. You're leaving?

我是首席游骑兵
I'm the First Ranger.

近来有些令人不安的报告 什么样的报告?
There have been disturbing reports. What kind of reports?

我不愿相信的报告
The kind I don't want to believe.

我随你同去 我不会让你失望的
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

琼恩 你还不是游骑兵
You're no Ranger, Jon.

可我比他们都强… 你不比任何人强！
But I'm better than everyBetter than no one!

想得到什么样的待遇 就得证明自己有什么样的本事
A man gets what he earns, when he earns it.

等我回来再谈
We'll speak when I return.

熊的蛋蛋 加上… 噢 别逗了
A bear's balls. Oh, you're joking?

加上它的脑子 肠子和心肺 用它身上的油煎熟了
And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat.

当你身处绝境长城之外 一个星期没饭吃的时候 你什么也不会给狼剩下
When you're a hundred miles North of The Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.

熊的蛋蛋是个什么味道啊？
And how do a bear's balls taste?

你呢 大人？你吃过的最古怪的东西是啥？
And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

多恩娘们算吗？
Do Dornish girls count?

所以说 你周游七国 招揽摸包贼和盗马贼 介绍来这里当兵喽？
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?

他们也不全是罪犯啦
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

有时会遇上吃不饱饭的穷孩子
Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed.

有时会遇上渴望出人头地的贵族青年
Some of 'em's highborn lads looking for glory.

结果他们发现在这儿混口饭吃还比较靠谱 对吧？
They have a better chance finding feed than glory.

守夜人军团在你眼中就是个笑话 是不？
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

兰尼斯特 你是不是觉得我们
Is that what we are, Lannister?

是一支可笑的黑衣杂技团？
An army of jesters in black?

错 你们的人手不足以成团 而且除了这个尤伦 也没有谁特别搞笑
You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.

我希望你回到君临后 能把我们真实的故事讲给别人听
I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing.

在你饮酒作乐 寻花问柳的时候 偶尔也能摸摸良心 在这里受训的孩子 将来有很多会葬身于长城之外
But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels half the boys you've seen training will die North of The Wall.

他们有的逃不过野人的斧头 有的是病死 还有的被严寒夺去性命
Might be a Wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold.

正因为他们的牺牲奉献 你们这帮脑满肠肥的陛下才能享受夏日午后的憩静
And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

你觉得我算脑满肠肥吗？
Do you think I'm plump?

听着 班杨…我能叫你班杨吗？
Listen, Benjenmay I call you Benjen?

随便你
Call me what you like.

我不晓得我哪里冒犯了你
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

但我郑重声明我非常尊敬守夜人军团
I have great admiration for The Night's Watch.

尊敬身为首席游骑兵的你
I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.

知道吗 我哥哥曾告诉我 在“但是”之前所做的声明 全是狗屁
You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word 'but' really counts.

我不相信长城之外 有巨人 尸鬼或是什么异鬼
I don't believe that Giants and Ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond The Wall.

我认为我们和 野人的区别只在于 当长城拔地而起时 我们的祖先 碰巧住在正确的一边
I believe that the only difference between us and the Wildlings is that when The Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.

野人和我们没什么差别
The Wildlings are no different from us.

可能更彪悍一些
A little rougher maybe.

但终究是血肉之躯
But they're made of meat and bone.

我知道怎么追踪 怎么杀死他们
I know how to track them and I know how to kill them.

搅得我辗转难眠的并非野人
It's not the Wildlings giving me sleepless nights.

你没有去过长城之北 就不要不懂装懂
You've never been North of The Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.

请保重 保暖 在都城好好享受 兄弟
Keep well, keep warm. Enjoy the capital, brother.

我觉得他喜欢上我了
I think he's starting to like me.

下隧道 穿到另一头去
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

他会在长城北边呆上一两个月
He'll be North of The Wall for a month or two.

他这么说 你要南下君临？
So you're heading down to King's Landing too.

对 后天启程
Aye, day after tomorrow.

这儿一半的人来自君临的地牢
I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.

不妨同路吧 你是个好伴儿
Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.

大人 我…我可是一贯风餐露宿的啊
I... I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.

我们会住最好的城堡和旅店
We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns.

没有人敢怠慢兰尼斯特家的人
No one turns away a Lannister.

喔 你这是做什么？
Oh, what are you doing?

卡丽熙 您上次来月事是什么时候?
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

您有身孕了 卡丽熙
You change, Khaleesi.

这是圣马的祝福啊
It's a blessing from the great stallion.

对马上民族来说 弯刀是好东西 易于掌控
For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle.

对付你的多斯拉克同胞很顺手
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.

但要对付穿全身板甲的人… 铁衣服 亚拉克弯刀穿不透甲胄
But a man in full plate steel dress.  the arakh won't get through the steel.

这时阔剑就派上用场了
That's where the broadsword has the advantage.

它是为了刺穿盔甲而设计的
Designed for piercing plate.

我们多斯拉克人不穿铁衣服
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

缓慢 没错 但也能保人性命
Slow. It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

我父亲教会我如何战斗
My father taught me how to fight.

他说速度比力量重要
He taught me that speed defeats size.

听说你父亲是著名的勇士
I heard that your father was a famous warrior.

他是拔尔勃卡奥的血盟卫
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

安达尔人乔拉 你父亲呢 他也是位勇士吗？
And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?

他是个荣誉感极强的人 我却背叛了他…
A man of great honor and I betrayed him.

卡丽熙今晚想换换口味
The khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. 

哪来的兔子
There are no rabbits.

那就搞几只鸭子 她爱吃鸭子
Find some ducks for me. She likes ducks.

你在这里见过鸭子吗蠢女人? 没兔子、没鸭子
Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks.

你到底长眼睛没？啊？
Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?

那就杀只狗吧 狗我见过不少
Dogs then. I have seen many dogs.

我记得她不喜欢狗肉
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

卡丽熙怀上孩子了
The Khaleesi have baby inside her.

是真的 她已经两个月没来月事了
It is true. She does not bleed for two moons.

肚子也鼓起来了
Her belly start to swell.

圣马的祝福啊
A blessing from the great stallion.

她实在不想再吃马肉了
She does not want to eat horse.

我让他们宰只山羊当晚餐好了
I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper.

我要去科霍尔走一趟
I need to ride to Qohor.

呃 可我们正向维斯·多斯拉克进发啊
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

别担心 我会赶上来的
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

这么大的部落容易找
The horde's easy to find.

你别站死了
Don't stand so still.

动起来才不容易被击中
It's harder to hit a moving target.

你正相反 你动作太频繁
Except for you. You move too much.

有时候自己都能撞我剑上
I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.

你经历过几个冬天 提利昂大人？
How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

据说我降生时的冬天持续了整整三年 伊蒙师傅
They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.

这个夏天已经过了九年
This summer has lasted nine.

而学城的报告证明白昼已经渐渐缩短
But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter.

史塔克的族语终究是要应验的：
The Starks are always right eventually:

这次的冬季将十分漫长 随之降临的是黑暗的年代
This one will be long and dark things will come with it.

我们最近抓到了很多野人 他们正向南逃亡 数量逐月增加
We've been capturing Wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south.

他们声称见到了走动的异鬼
The ones who flee say they've seen the White Walkers.

是啊 兰尼斯港的渔夫还经常看到美人鱼呢
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

一位守夜人游骑兵坚称自己的同伴为异鬼所害
One of our own Rangers swore he saw them kill his companions.

奈德·史塔克砍他脑袋时
He swore it right up to the moment

他仍不改口
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

守夜人部队是唯一 能帮助王国阻挡 北方黑暗势力的屏障
The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond.

而它现在却是 由毛头小子和身心俱疲的老头子组成
And it has has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

我们的人数不到一千
There are less than a thousand of us now.

无力守卫长城沿线的堡垒
We can't man the other castles on The Wall.

无法保证巡逻任务的质量
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

我们所拥有的资源 仅能勉强维持温饱 并武装自己 令姐 贵为当今王后
We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed. Your sister sits by the side the King.

请代我们向她请愿
Tell her we need help.

当凛冬降临时 若没有万全准备 天知道下场会多凄惨
When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.

卓戈 卡奥 
多斯拉克部族首领

真有些舍不得你走 兰尼斯特
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

我跟这鬼天气似乎结下了梁子
It's either me or this cold.

它不肯让路 我只有乖乖滚蛋喽
And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.

你南下途中会在临冬城稍事停留吗？
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way south?

诸神在上 君临和长城之间 可没几张羽毛床
Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.

如果你见到我弟弟布兰 告诉他我很想他
If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him.

告诉他我一有机会就去看他
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

他的双腿没法复原了
He'll never walk again.

如果不幸做了瘸子 当个贵族家的瘸子总归要好些
If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple.

从明天起你正午就必须到
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

从明天起你得接住
Tomorrow you will catch it.

不对不对 小子
That is not the way, boy.

这不是双手挥的巨剑
This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.

它太重了 它该多重就有多重 这才能锻炼你的肌肉
It's too heavy. It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong.

你只能单手持剑
One hand is all that is needed.

但你的站姿错了
Now you are standing all wrong.

身体侧一点
Turn your body sideface.

你很瘦 这挺好
You are skinny. That is good.

目标缩小了
The target is smaller.

现在让我看看你是怎么握的
Now the griplet me see.

手型要优雅
The grip must be delicate.

剑必须和你的手合为一体
The steel must be part of your arm.

你的手会掉吗？当然不会
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

西利欧·佛瑞尔在布拉佛斯海王手下干了九年的首席剑士
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

他懂得这些东西 听他的话 小子
He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.

管他男的女的 你是一把剑 这样就够了
Boy, girlyou are a sword, that is all.

你握的不是战斧
You are not holding a battleaxe.

你握的是… 缝衣针
You are holdingA Needle.

现在我们开始跳舞
Now we will begin the dance.

记住 孩子 我们学的不是维斯特洛的钢铁之舞 骑士之舞 挥来砍去
Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning the Knight's Dance, hacking and hammering.

这是杀手之舞
This is the Bravo's Dance...

行动敏捷 出其不意
It is swift and sudden.

人都是水做的 你知道吗？
All men are made of water, do you know this?

当你刺中人体 水流外泄 人就会死
If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die.

现在你来打我试试
Now you will try to strike me.

小少爷又做梦了啊
The little lord's been dreaming again.

我们有客人 我不想见人
We have visitors. I don't want to see anyone.

是嘛? 要是我成天守着这老太婆不见人 我早疯了
Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.

反正你没得选 罗柏在等你
Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.

我不想去 我也不想
I don't want to go. Neither do I.

可罗柏现下是临冬城主所以我得听他的 而你得听我的
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.

阿多?  抱布兰去大厅
Hodor? Help Bran down the hall.

不得不说 我上次来访比较受欢迎啊
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

只要是守夜人的弟兄 临冬城都欢迎
Any man of The Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.

'只要是守夜人的弟兄' 所以我不算啰 小子? 
Any man of The Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?

兰尼斯特 我父亲不在的时候
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

我就是临冬城主 不是什么小子
I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.

那你好歹该懂点儿城主应有的礼貌
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

你记得发生了什么吗? 
Do you remember anything about what happened?

这孩子完全不记得那天的事情
He has no memory of that day.

奇怪  你到底来干嘛?  能让你这可爱的仆人蹲下吗? 
Curious. Why are you here would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?

看得我脖子痛 蹲下 阿多
My neck is beginning to hurt. Kneel, Hodor.

喜欢骑马吗 布兰?  喜欢
Do you like to ride, Bran? Yes.

我是说 我以前喜欢
Well, I mean I did like to.

这孩子的腿已经不能用了 那又怎样? 
The boy has lost the use of his legs. What of it?

有合适的马匹和鞍具 残废也能骑
With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.

我不是残废 那我也不是侏儒啰
I'm not a cripple. Then I'm not a dwarf.

我老爸听了不知多高兴
My father will rejoice to hear it.

我有礼物送你
I have a gift for you.

把这个交给你们的马鞍师傅 照着做就行了
Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.

你们得让马儿去适应他
You must shape the horse to the rider.

找匹未受训的一岁小马教它服从缰绳的指挥 教它认识这孩子的声音
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.

我真能骑马吗? 
Will I really be able to ride?

骑在马上 你跟别人一样高
On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.

你耍什么把戏? 你为什么要帮他? 
Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?

我嘛 心里有个小小的弱点向来同情杂种 残废和其他怪胎
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.

您帮了我弟弟一个大忙
You've done my brother a kindness.

就让临冬城款待您罢
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

少假惺惺啦 史塔克城主
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.

城外有家妓院
There's a brothel outside your walls.

我还是去那儿弄张床 这样咱俩都会睡得安稳些
There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.

抵挡不住北方妞的魅力是吗? 
Couldn't resist some Northern ass?

不介意红发的话 去找罗丝
If you like redheads, ask for Ros.

专程来送我啊 葛雷乔伊? 你太好心了
Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you.

可你的主子似乎不喜欢我们兰尼斯特家的人
Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.

他不是我主子 不是? 这样啊
He's not my master. No, of course not.

凯特琳夫人上哪儿去了? 她怎不出来接见我? 
Where is Lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?

她身体不适 恐怕她不在临冬城吧? 
She wasn't feeling well. She's not in Winterfell, is she?

她究竟上哪儿去了?  我家夫人的行踪…
Where did she go? My Lady's whereabouts

你这副奴才相还真让人感动啊
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

巴隆·葛雷乔伊若是得知自己仅剩的儿子成了别人的狗腿子会作何感想呢? 
Tell me, how do you think balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?

记得当年 我亲眼目睹我老爸的舰队在兰尼斯港里被焚毁
I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

是你几位叔叔干得的好事吧? 
I believe your uncles were responsible?

那场面一定颇为壮观
Must have been a pretty sight.

无数水手被活活烧死当然很壮观
Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.

没错 那天你们赢得很漂亮
Yes, a great victory for your people.

可惜战争最终却是个奇耻大辱 我们是以一敌十…说明那是一次愚蠢的叛乱!
Shame how it all turned out. We were outnumbered 10 to one a stupid rebellion then.

当你哥哥们白白送命时你老爸怕是该清醒了吧
I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle.

他还不得不赔上你 让你去做敌人的侍从
Now here you are, your enemy's squire.

当心你的舌头 小恶魔 冒犯你啦? 
Careful, imp. I've offended you.

抱歉 这一早上够我受的
Forgive me, it's been a rough morning.

不管怎样 你不要太失望啊
Anyway, don't despair.

我打出生就让我老爸失望不也活得好好的? 
I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it.

你下次跟罗丝风流算我请
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

放心 我不会把她干得下不了床的
I'll try not to wear her out.

左脚向前 很好
Left foot forward. Good.

出手的时候身体旋转
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.

全身的重量贯在剑上
Put all your weight behind it.

七层地狱啊 那家伙…
What in seven hells is that?

地狱怕是要多盖一层才塞得下他
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

山姆威尔·塔利 来自角陵 我的意思是…我曾经是角陵塔利家的人
Samwell Tarly, of Horn HillI mean, I was of Horn Hill.

我前来加入黑衫军 你是来吃黑布丁的吧? 
I've come to take the black. Come to take the black pudding.

你总不至于比看上去更不中用
Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.

求求你 别打了 给我起来
Please, no more. On your feet.

揍他 直到他爬起来为止
Hit him till he finds his feet.

这年头南方连盗猎者和小偷都人手短缺
It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down South.

妈的 倒把哀嚎的猪送来守长城了 琼恩
Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Jon!

看来 咱们的野种谈恋爱了
Looks like the bastard's in love.

好吧 雪诺大人 你打算为心爱的小姐挺身而出 就好好打一场吧
All right then, Lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.

你俩过来三个人应该够猪小姐受的了
You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.

你们只需打发掉挡路的野种
All you've got to do is get past the bastard.

你当真想打?  当然不
Are you sure you want to do this? No.

投降投降投降! 我投降
Yield yield yield! I yield.

今天就到此为止
We're done for today.

你们只配干这个
That's all you're good for.

打得漂亮嘛! 滚开
Well fought! Piss off.

你愿意的话…可以叫我山姆
You can call me Sam... If you want.

我妈叫我山姆… 你知道 这事还没完
My mother calls me Samit's not going to get any easier, you know?

你以后必须保护自己
You're going to have to defend yourself.

你怎么不站起来反击? 
Why didn't you get up and fight?

可我就是做不到… 为什么? 
I just couldn't. Why not?

家父常这么说 长城可不是胆小鬼该来的地方
My father always says so. The Wall's no place for cowards.

你说得对 对不起…
You're right. I'm sorry.

我…只想谢谢你
I just... wanted to thank you.

别人看见咱们跟他说话了
People saw us talking to him.

搞不好会把咱们也当胆小鬼
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

你太笨啦 当不成胆小鬼
You're too stupid to be a coward.

你才笨得当不成… 当不成什么?  趁夏天还没结束你快想呀
You're too stupid to be aQuick now, before summer's over.

维斯·多斯拉克…马王之城
Vaes Dothrakthe city of the horselords.

一堆泥巴 木头和马屎 这帮野蛮人什么也不会 他们现在是我的族人
Mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do. These are my people now.

别再叫他们野蛮人了
You shouldn't call them savages.

我爱叫什么就叫什么 他们都属于我
I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.

卓戈卡奥把我的军队带错了方向
Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.

假如我哥哥真的得到一支多斯拉克军队 你能助他征服七国吗? 
If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

多斯拉克人从未渡过狭海
The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea.

只要马不能喝的液体他们都怕
They fear any water their horses can't drink.

劳勃国王的确可能蠢到跟他们在旷野决战 可他身边藏龙卧虎
King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.

你了解这些人吗?  我曾与他们并肩作战 很久以前的事了
And you know these men? I fought beside them once, long ago.

后来奈德·史塔克要我的脑袋
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

我不得不背井离乡
He drove me from my land.

为什么?  我没钱却有一个很会花钱的老婆
Why? I had no money and an expensive wife.

她现在在哪儿? 
And where is she now?

在一个遥远的地方在另一个男人怀里
In another place, with another man.

陛下?  怎么啦 亲爱的? 
Your Grace? Yes, my dear?

他们称您为最后的真龙传人…
They call you the Last Dragon...

在您的血管里流淌着龙血吗? 
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

这完全有可能
It's entirely possible.

世上的龙都去哪儿了? 
What happened to the dragons?

我听说勇者屠龙
I was told that brave men killed them all.

勇者才不屠龙咧
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

勇者骑龙
The brave men rode them.

骑着龙从瓦雷利亚出发建立了空前绝后的辉煌文明
Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen.

最强大的魔龙用其吐息铸造了铁王座…就是现在篡夺者替我暖着的王座
The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the usurper is keeping warm for me.

上千把被征服者的宝剑
The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them...

像蜡烛一样镕铸在一起
Melted together like so many candles.

我一直梦想着去看龙
I have always wanted to see a dragon.

这是世界上我最想见识的东西了
There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.

只需挥动翅膀想去哪里就去哪里 去天涯海角…
And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else...Far away.

任何人 任何东西都不敢欺负他们 否则就会被烧成灰烬…
Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing...

…像蜡烛一样
...Like so many candles.

真的 要是能见到龙我会开心死的!
Yes. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.

好吧 我以为你在妓院里待了十五年
Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,

见到蓝天都会开心死了
I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.

我又没被关起来 我见过不少世面
I was not locked in. I have seen things.

说说看呢?  我见过…
What have you seen? I've seen...

佩带真正的龙晶匕首的亚夏人
A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass.

我见过有人变脸跟换衣服似的
I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes.

我见过一个穿金衣的海盗 他的船张着彩色丝绸的风帆
And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk.

见过海盗船?  见过龙啦
A pirate ship? A dragon.

最后一条龙早在我出生以前就死了
No, the last one died many years before I was born.

但我告诉你 我见过:
I'll tell you what I have seen:

它们被用来装饰红堡的王座厅
They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.

我小时候 大概三四岁时 父王会带我去参观 他要我背诵他们的名字
When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him.

如果全说对了 他就会奖励我糖吃
When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.

厅门边的龙是最后孵化的几只 都是发育不良的畸形
The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong.

头骨比猎犬的大不了多少
Skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

但随着你走近铁王座
But as you got closer to the Iron Throne...

龙头一个比一个大 一个比一个大
They got bigger and bigger and bigger.

还有'黑死神'贝勒里恩
And Balerion the dread...

正是贝勒里恩的龙焰 熔就了七大王国 大一统的江山
...Whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.

那些头骨后来怎样了? 
What happened to the skulls?

大概早已被篡夺者打成齑粉
The usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.

挫骨扬灰了吧
Scattered to the wind.

可我买你是做什么? 
What did I buy you for?

为了让自己伤感吗?  不是的 陛下
To make me sad? No, your Grace.

是为了 呃 教导您妹妹
To, uh, teach your sister.

教导我妹妹怎么上床? 
To teach my sister how to be a better lover?

你以为我买你是为了便宜卓戈卡奥? 
You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy?

噢 你这漂亮的小傻瓜
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

继续来啊 来啊
Go on then. Get on with it.

将来你的夫君会坐上铁王座 而你将坐在他身旁
Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.

等你们有了儿子 你会带他进宫
And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.

维斯特洛的王公贵族们会齐聚于此 瞻仰小王子的… 如果我生的是女孩怎么办? 
All the Lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince what if I have a girl?

若诸神保佑 你会生下一大群儿女
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.

如果我只生女孩怎么办? 
What if I only have girls?

瞎操心
I wouldn't worry about that.

珍妮·普尔的妈生了五个孩子 全是女孩
Jeyne Poole's mother had five childrenall of them girls.

这很罕见的
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

好吧 如果你只生女孩
Well, if you only had girls,

那王位就不得不传给乔佛里王子的弟弟
I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

这样每个人都会恨我
And everyone would hate me.

没有人恨你啊
Nobody could ever hate you.

乔佛里就恨我 胡说
Joffrey does. Nonsense.

你怎会说出这种话? 
Why would you say such a thing?

珊莎 就因为狼的事吗? 
That business with the wolves? Sansa,

我告诉你多少次了
I've told you a hundred times:

冰原狼不是… 请别再提这个了
A direwolf is notplease shut up about it.

算了 让我们说说课上的内容吧
Do you remember your lessons?

谁铸造了铁王座? 
Who built the Iron Throne?

谁建造了红堡?
And who built the Red Keep?

它总共花了多少年才建成… 我爷爷和叔叔都死在这里 是不是? 
And how many years did it take to build my grandfather and Uncle were murdered here, weren't they?

嗯 他们是被伊里斯国王下令处死的
They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

他为什么要杀他们? 
Why were they killed?

这些问题你应该去请教你父亲
You should be speak to your father about these matters.

我不想跟我父亲说话…永远都不想!
I don't want to speak to my fatherever.

珊莎 总有一天 你会明白你父亲的苦衷
Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father.

诸位大人 这些麻烦都是 首相的比武大会带来的 国王的比武大会
It's The Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, My Lords. The King's tournament.

我跟你保证 首相对这事一点兴趣都没有
I assure you The Hand wants no part of it.

您怎么说都行 史塔克大人 可事实是城里挤满了人 而每天都有更多人涌入
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.

昨儿晚上就有一起酒馆暴乱 一座妓院失火 三起持刀械斗 还有匹喝醉的马冲到静默修女街去了
Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.

吓人哟 你要是连城里的秩序都无法维持 恐怕都城守备队得换个有办法的人来当司令啰
Dreadful. If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can.

我需要人手 雇五十个新兵
I need more men. You'll get 50.

钱的事交给贝里席大人打点 我打点? 
Lord Baelish will see it paid for. I will?

你连比武冠军的赏金都筹得出 多弄几个铜板维持秩序想必不成问题
You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace.

我再从我的贴身护卫中拨二十个人给你 直到城里这批人离开为止
I'll also give you 20 of my household guard till the crowds have left.

非常感谢 首相大人
Thank you, My Lord Hand, Ser.

我一定让他们派上用场
They will be put to good use.

闹剧早一天结束 我就早一天安心
The sooner this is over, the better.

王国就是因为这种事才兴盛的啊 大人
The realm prospers from such events, My Lord.

这是上等阶级求取荣耀的大好时机 也能让老百姓们暂时忘忧解愁
They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.

还让城里的旅店通通客满 妓女接客接到合不拢脚
And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged.

我毫不怀疑 某些人会借此大捞一笔
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.

如果没别的事 大人们…
If there's nothing else, My Lords?

每到这种天气 我就羡慕你们北方人 还有夏雪
On days like this, I envy you Northerners your summer snows.

明天见 大人…
Until tomorrow, My Lord

我一直想找您谈谈琼恩·艾林的事
I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

噢 他的死对我们 是个沉重的打击
Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us.

我亲自出马照料他 可惜还是无济于事
I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him.

那病压垮了他 又快又猛
His sickness struck him very hard and very fast.

他去世前一晚 还来我住的地方找我呢
I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.

艾林大人经常找我商量国事
Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.

我可是做了多年大学士
I have been Grand Maester for many years.

国王和首相都会来征求我的…
Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since

琼恩去世前那天晚上找你做什么? 
What did Jon want the night before he died?

噢 他来找我要一本书
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

恐怕 您会觉得很无趣 大人
Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, My Lord.

没关系 我只想看看
No, I'd like to read it.

《七国主要贵族之世家谱系与历史》 内附关于许多爵爷 夫人 和他们子女的描述
'The Lineages and Histories of the Great H of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.'

如我所言 大人 这是本无趣的书
As I said, My Lord, a ponderous read.

琼恩·艾林可曾告诉你他想在书中找什么? 
Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?

他没说 大人 我也没冒昧多问
He did not, My Lord. And I did not presume to ask.

琼恩的死… 令人惋惜
Jon's death... Such a tragedy.

他病危时跟您说过什么吗? 
...Did he say anything to you during his final hours?

没什么要紧的话 大人
Nothing of import, My Lord.

有一句 他反复重复: 
Ohthere was one phrase he kept repeating:

我记得是'种性强韧'
'The seed is strong,' I think it was.

所谓人之将死 其言易乱 史塔克大人
Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark.

人们往往过于看重遗言 其实遗言有时不比 初生儿的哭闹更有价值
For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.

你确信他是自然死亡? 
And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?

不然会是什么呢? 
What else could it be?

这想法叫人不寒而栗
A disturbing thought.

不 不 不 我认为不可能
No no no, I don't think it likely.

首相大人广受爱戴
The Hand was loved by all.

怎会有人…
What sort of man would dare

我听说毒药是女人的武器
I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.

是有这种说法 女人… 懦夫…
Yes, women, cravens...

您可知道 瓦里斯伯爵是个太监? 
Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch?

这事路人皆知
Everybody knows that.

我想不通 这种人怎能成为御前会议里的重臣? 
How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.

我占用您太多时间了
I've taken enough of your time.

没关系 大人 为您服务是我的荣… 谢谢您
No trouble at all, My Lord. It's a great honor thank you.

请留步
I'll find my own way out.

西利欧说水舞者 可以用一根脚趾站好几个小时
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.

跌下去可不好玩
It's a hard fall down these steps.

西利欧说每次受伤都是一个教训 而每个教训都会让我变强
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.

明天起我开始抓猫 猫? 
Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. Cats?

他说每个剑客都应该研究猫
He says every swordsman should study cats.

它们静如影 轻如羽
They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.

练出好身手才可能捉住它们
You have to be quick to catch them.

这点他说得很对
He's right about that.

现在布兰醒了 他会来跟我们一起住吗? 
Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?

他得先恢复体力才成
Well, he needs to get his strength back first.

他一直想当御林铁卫
He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard.

现在当不成了 是不是?  是的
He can't be one now, can he? No.

但有朝一日 他或能获得封地 或成为国王的重臣
But someday he could be Lord of a Holdfast or sit on the King's Council.

也或像'筑城者'布兰登那样 兴建雄伟的城堡
Or he might raise castles like Brandon the builder.

我可以获得封地吗? 
Can I be Lord of a Holdfast?

你会嫁给某位大人物 管理他的城堡
You will marry a high lord and rule his castle.

你的儿子们会当上骑士 王子或领主
And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.

艾里莎爵士让我跟你一起站岗
Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new Watch partner.

我眼神不太好
I don't see all that well.

站到火堆边来吧
Come stand by the fire.

这里暖和些 没事儿 没事儿 我不冷
It's warmer. No, that's all right. I'm fine.

才不是 你快冻僵了
You're not. You're freezing.

我讨厌高的地方
I don't like high places.

你讨厌高的地方你到底还有什么不怕的? 
You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.

你干嘛来这儿 山姆? 
What are you doing here, Sam?

我十八岁命名日那天早上 我父亲来找我
On the morning of my 18th Nameday, my father came to me.

'你就快成年了 '他说…
'You're almost a man now,' he said...

'如果你不照办 '他说…
'If you do not,' he said...

艾里沙爵士明天还会逼我打架 对吧? 
Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

你知道 我明天也不会有进步
I'm not going to get any better, you know?

你明天也应该不会再退步了
You can't get any worse.

听说您在读一本无聊的书
I hear you're reading a boring book.

派席尔是个大嘴巴
Pycelle talks too much.

您认识峡谷的修夫爵士吗? 
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

这不奇怪 直到最近他都还只是个侍从 琼恩·艾林的侍从
Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squireJon Arryn's squire.

主子突然暴毙后 突然间他就被封为了骑士
He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.

你又为什么要告诉我这些? 
Why are you telling me this?

我答应凯特帮你
I promised cat that I'd help you.

我这就去跟他谈 这想法大错特错
I'll speak to him. A singularly bad idea.

看见那小子了么? 
Do you see that boy there?

他是瓦里斯的小小鸟
One of Varys's little birds.

'八爪蜘蛛'对您的一举一动都很有兴趣
The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.

那是王后的人
That one belongs to the Queen.

那个假装读书的修女 您瞧见没? 
And do you see that septa pretending to read her book?

都不是 她是我的眼线
No, she's one of mine.

您手下可有让您彻底信任的人? 
Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?

有 聪明的回答是: 没有 大人
Yes. The wiser answer was no, My Lord.

算了 送信给您这位模范部下 让他去找修夫爵士
Get a message to this paragon of yours discreetlysend him to question Ser Hugh.

然后再派他去城里找某位武器师傅
After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.

那师傅在钢铁街顶上有间大屋子
He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.

为什么?  我不是说了吗 我有我的眼线 据说艾林大人在死前数周里 多次拜访这位武器师傅
Why? I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.

培提尔大人 或许我不应该不信任你
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.

不信任我 是你跳下马背以来所做过的最明智的事
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.

修夫爵士! 没看到我在忙吗? 
Ser Hugh! As you can see, I'm busy.

我受艾德·史塔克公爵差遣而来 他是当今首相
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King.

我是他的侍卫队长
I'm the Captain of his guard.

不好意思 敢问您贵姓啊 爵士先…
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name, Ser...

我不是'爵士' 我没受封
No 'Ser.' I'm not a knight.

明白了 碰巧 我可是个爵士
I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.

他说 倘若首相大人有意和他谈 他乐于接见
He said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself.

他现在是骑士了
He's a knight, you see.

这些南方骑士活像趾高气昂的公鸡
They strut around like roosters down here.

其实半点风浪没经过
Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.

您不该亲自出马的 陛下
You shouldn't be out here, My Lord.

这里到处是眼线 让他们去看
There's no telling who has eyes where. Let them look.

前任首相是找过我 大人 找过我好几次
The former Hand did call on me, My Lord, several times.

遗憾的是我没那个荣幸 不曾为他打过什么
I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.

那艾林大人来干什么? 
What did Lord Arryn want?

他总是来见那孩子
He always came to see the boy.

我也想见见那孩子
I'd like to see him as well.

遵命 大人 詹德利!
As you Gendry! My lord.

以这年纪算得强壮 干起活来也挺勤快
Strong for his age. He works hard.

小子 让首相大人瞧瞧你打的头盔
Show the hand the helmet you made, lad.

做得很好 这不是拿来卖的
This is fine work. It's not for sale.

小子 这可是首相大人!
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

大人他看得上眼 你还不… 我做了给自己戴
If his lordship wants the helmI made it for me.

大人 请千万原谅 没什么好原谅的
Forgive him, My Lord. There's nothing to forgive.

艾林大人来看你时 你们都说了些什么? 
When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?

大人 他不过就问了些问题
He just asked me questions is all, My Lord.

什么问题? 
What kind of questions?

他先问我的工作情况 主人待我如何啊 我喜不喜欢这差事啊
About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.

接着他又问了我妈的事
But then he started asking me about my mother.

你母亲?  问她是谁 长什么样这些
Your mother? Who she was, what she looked like.

你怎么回答? 
What did you tell him?

我小时候她就死了
She died when I was little.

有时会唱歌给我听
She'd sing to me sometimes.

回去干活罢 小伙子
Get back to work, lad.

哪天要是他不想继续铸剑 想要实际弄把刀玩玩的话 叫他来找我
If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.

他是劳勃国王的私生子
King Robert's bastard son.

这是史塔克大人呈给国王陛下的信
This is for the King from Lord Stark.

我是交给你还是直接… 嘘
Should I leave it with shhh.

你猜里面有多少女人? 
How many do you think are in there with him?

每当我值班时他就干这事儿… 故意让我听见 以此羞辱我老姐
He likes to do this when I'm on duty he makes me listen as he insults my sister.

要我原谅什么? 你做过对不起我的事吗? 
Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?

我们有过一面之缘
We've met before, you know.

一面之缘? 奇怪 我怎么没印象
Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

攻打派克城时 某个下午我们曾并肩作战
The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.

你的疤是那一仗留的 是
That's where you got your scar? Aye.

有个葛雷乔伊家的人差点戳瞎我眼睛
One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

狗娘养的 他们嗜血成性
Vicious sons of whores. They like their bloodshed.

到最后流的却是自己的血
They stopped liking it at the end.

那是一场令人难忘的战役
That was a proper battle. Do you remember

你可记得密尔的索罗斯当先冲进城墙缺口? 
Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?

他手里提着那把冒火的长剑
With his burning sword?

我到死也不会忘
I'll remember that till the day I die.

我在临冬城见到了葛雷乔伊的幼子
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

感觉就像在山顶上见着了鲨鱼
It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.

席恩? 他是个好孩子
Theon? He's a good lad.

我打赌 你闻起来像黑莓酱!
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!

过来 让我闻闻
Let me smell it. Come here.

我可以把这个交给你吗? 
Can I leave this with you?

这是史塔克大人的信
The message from Lord Stark.

我不是史塔克大人的听差
I don't serve Lord Stark.

你跑哪儿去啦?  跟山姆一起站岗
Where have you been? Watch duty.With Sam.

他怎么不来吃饭?  他不饿
Where is he? He wasn't hungry.

山姆跟大家没什么两样
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

都是这个世界的弃儿 走投无路才来到这里
There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here.

不管索恩怎么唆使
We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.

我们都不要在训练场上再欺负他了
Never again, no matter what Thorne says.

他现在是我们的手足兄弟 我们得保护他
He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.

你确实谈恋爱了啊 雪诺大人
You are in love, Lord Snow.

你们要孬种就孬种吧
You girls can do as you please.

但如果索恩叫我跟猪小姐打
But if Thorne puts me up against lady piggy,

我可是会切一大块火腿下来
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

你们愣着干嘛? 
What are you waiting for?

你觉得这很有趣 是不是? 
You think this is funny, do you?

等你们出了长城 不见天日之时 是要一个值得信赖的战友
When you're out there beyond The Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back?

你叫这婊子来对我发号施令!
You send this whore to give me commands?

我应该把她的人头还给你才对!
I should have sent you back her head!

卡丽熙 请原谅 我只是照您吩咐去找他
Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.

别怕 没事了
Hush now. It's all right.

伊丽 你带她下去 是 卡丽熙
Irri, take her and leave us. Yes, Khaleesi.

你为什么要打她? ! 我要跟你说多少遍? 
Why did you hit her?! How many times do I have to tell you?

不准你命令我!
You do not command me.

我没有命令你
I wasn't commanding you.

只是邀请你来共进晚餐
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

这是什么?  我的礼物
What's this? It's a gift.

我特地为你做的 多斯拉克破布吗? 
I had it made for you. Dothraki rags?

轮到你为我挑衣服啦?  请别这样
Are you going to dress me now? Please.

一股子马屎味
This stinks of manure. All of it.

你想把我变成他们中的一员 是不是? 
You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?

接下来你就会叫我跟着绑辫子了
Next you'll want to braid my hair.

你还没打过胜仗
You've no right to a braid.

没有权利绑辫子
You've won no victories yet.

竟敢顶嘴!
You do not talk back to me!

你不过是马王的小贱货
You are a horselord's slut.

你现在唤醒睡龙之怒了…
And now you've woken the dragon

我是多斯拉克人的卡丽熙!
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki!

我是最伟大的卡奥的妻子 我肚子里怀着他的儿子
I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me.

你再敢对我动手 就把你双手剁掉
The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.

据我所知好些长官 会跑去鼹鼠村逛窑子
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in mole's town.

你不觉得这有点儿不公平吗? 
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

要咱们发下毒誓 他们却偷溜出去找乐子
Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?

找乐子?  这些规定真荒唐
Sally on the side? It's silly, isn't it?

难道只有打光棍才能守长城? 
What, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate?

想不到你为这事愤愤不平
I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

我跟你一样想姑娘呢
But I like girls just as much as you do.

虽然她们不太想我就是了
They might not like me as much.

我从没…没跟姑娘睡过
I've neverbeen with one.

你大概睡过几百个罢
You've probably had hundreds.

真令人难以置信
I find that hard to believe.

我差点睡了一个
I came very close once.

我和一个女孩儿独处一室 脱光了衣服… 结果你不知道那话儿往哪放? 
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but you didn't know where to put it?

我知道往哪儿放
I know where to put it.

红的 好啊 我喜欢红发
Red. Oh, I like red hair.

说出来吓死 你有那么大? 
You don't want to know. That good?

那…既然这个罗丝有这么完美的… 你怎么不跟她做呢? 
So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect?

为什么我姓雪诺? 
And why is my surname snow?

你是北方的私生子
You're a bastard from the North.

我从未见过我母亲
I never met my mother.

我父亲甚至连她的名字都不肯告诉我
My father wouldn't even tell me her name.

我不知她是生是死
I don't know if she's living or dead.

不知她是贵族 是渔妇
I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a Fisherman's wife...

因此当我在妓院的厢房里 看着罗丝宽衣解带的时候
So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.

我忽然不想做了
But I couldn't do it.

我满脑子想的是 如果我让她怀上孩子 这孩子将来 岂不是又得叫雪诺? 
Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow?

这对孩子不公平
It's not a good life for a child.

你确实不知道那话儿该往哪儿放嘛
You didn't know where to put it?

风有点冷 哼 关在屋子里 生着火 这还是夏天呢
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer.

你们知道上个冬天是什么样吗? 
Do you boys even remember the last winter?

过去多久了? 差不多十年了罢? 
How long has it been now? What, 10 years?

临冬城里是不是也天寒地冻啊? 
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

不管仆人帮你生多少火 到头来仍感觉不到温暖? 
Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?

我自己生火 令人钦佩啊
I build my own fires. That's admirable.

告诉你小鬼 上个冬天 我在长城外边熬了整整六个月
I spent six months out there, beyond The Wall during the last winter.

那次任务原定只用两周
It was supposed to be a twoweek mission.

有人说曼斯·雷德计划突袭东海望
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.

我们便外出去抓几个'舌头' 以侦察敌情
So we went out to look for some of his men capture them, gather some knowledge.

曼斯·雷德手下的野人都是硬汉
The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.

你们永远别想跟他们相比
Harder than you'll ever be.

他们对自己的地盘了如指掌
They know their country better than we do.

他们知道暴风雪即将来临
They knew there was a storm coming in.

于是便躲进洞里 静待风雪过去
So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.

我们却在野外与暴风雪撞个正着
And we got caught in the open.

那咆哮的狂风 把百尺大树连根拔起 谁敢脱手套 掏那话儿出来尿尿 手指头就废了
Wind so strong it yanked 100foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost.

先死的是马
The horses died first.

我们既没东西喂它们吃 更没法为他们保暖
We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.

吃马肉没什么大不了的
Eating the horses was easy.

但等到后来兄弟们也开始倒下…
But later when we started to fall...

我们怎没想到带几个你这样的小鬼呢? 
We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?

白白胖胖的
Soft, fat boys like you.

足够应付十天半月咧 骨头还可以熬汤
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup.

很快又会有新兵过来 到时候我会把你们交给总司令 让他为你们分配职业 别人会称你们作守夜人 但如果你们信以为真 就真是笨蛋
Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of The Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.

等冬天一来 你们就会像苍蝇一样
And come the winter you will die...

你大哥雷加是最后的真龙传人
Your brother Rhaegar was the Last Dragon.

韦赛里斯连条蛇的影子都不如
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.

可他毕竟是真正的国王
He is still the true king.

你希望你哥哥坐上铁王座? 
Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?

可老百姓们等着他啊
But the common people are waiting for him.

伊利里欧说他们忙着缝制真龙旗帜 祈祷韦赛里斯早日解放他们
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.

老百姓祈祷的是风调雨顺 子女健康 以及永不结束的夏日
The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.

他们不关心王公贵族的权力游戏
They don't care what games the high lords play.

那你会为何事祈祷呢 乔拉爵士? 
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

我哥哥永远无法夺回七国
My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms.

就算我夫君给他军队 他也没有统御的能力
He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.

他永远无法带我们回家
He'll never take us home.

珊莎好孩子 这位是培提尔·贝里席伯爵 他… 我是你们家的故友
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known an old friend of the family.

跟你母亲相识多年
I've known your mother a long long time.

他们为什么管你叫小指头啊?  艾莉亚!
Why do they call you Littlefinger? Arya!

没礼貌! 啊 没关系没关系
Don't be rude! No, it's quite all right.

这是因为我小时候特别瘦小 家族封地又位于狭小的五指半岛的缘故 所以你瞧 这是个恰如其分的绰号
When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

老子在这儿坐了一整天了!
I've been sitting here for days!

还他妈不开始!  老子快憋不住尿了!
Start the damn joust before I piss myself!

外号'魔山'
They call him the Mountain.

他是猎狗的哥哥
The hound's older brother.

那他的对手是谁?  峡谷的修夫爵士
And his opponent? Ser Hugh of the Vale.

从前是琼恩·艾林的侍从
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

年轻人爬得很快哪
Lo how far he's come.

行了行了 别他妈瞎折腾!
Yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp.

和你期望的不太一样? 
Not what you were expecting?

没有人告诉过你猎狗和魔山两兄弟间
Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound?

温馨感人的手足情谊吗? 
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

猎狗小时候 大概六岁的时候吧
The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe.

格雷果比他大几岁 壮得像头牛 已经'远近闻名'
Gregor a few years older already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.

是啊 有的孩子 生性就挺残暴
Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.

某天晚上 格雷果发现弟弟 在火盆边玩玩具
One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire

那是他的玩具 一个木雕骑士
Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.

他二话不说 拎起弟弟的后颈 将弟弟的半边脸就往炭堆里按
Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals.

他紧紧按住 任由弟弟惨叫不停 任由弟弟的脸庞被烧化
Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.

没有几个人知道这个故事
There aren't very many people who know that story.

我不会说出去的 我保证
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

若是传到猎狗耳中
If the Hound so much as heard you mention it,

恐怕君临城内所有的骑士加在一起 也保护不了你
I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.

陛下 王后陛下驾到
My Lord, her Grace the Queen.

陛下 你缺席了你的比武会
Your Grace. You're missing your tournament.

挂着我的名字而已 跟我毫无瓜葛
Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.

我们…能否抛开在国王大道上发生的不幸 一场由狼引发的不幸
I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us the ugliness with the wolves.

逼你宰了那野兽是有点过分
And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.

可为了孩子 我们时不时得使出点过分的手段
Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.

看来史塔克家就她喜欢这儿
She's the only Stark who does.

她像她母亲 不大像北方人
Favors her mother, not much of the North in her.

你究竟为何来这里?  我正想问你同样的问题
What are you doing here? I might ask the same of you.

你想达成什么目标? 
What is it you hope to accomplish?

国王召我来辅佐他 治理国家 在他另择贤能之前 这就是我的使命
The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.

你改变不了他 你也帮不了他
You can't change him. You can't help him.

他会继续随心所欲 恣意妄为
He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done.

而你只能跟在他屁股后头 尽力收拾残局
You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.

职责所在 也只能如此
If that's my job, then so be it.

你只是个兵吗? 
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

只会领命办事? 
You take your orders and you carry on.

你老爸把你哥培养成领袖
I suppose it makes sense.

却把你训练成不动脑筋的走卒
Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.

陛下 我所受的教育是时刻准备消灭敌人
I was also trained to kill my enemies, your Grace.

好心人 七神保佑你们!
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

小子! 面包 肉和啤酒 搞快点
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

噢 好主意 老爹 我正饿着哪
Ah, good idea, grandfather. I'm starving.

要不要先来首小曲儿…? 
A song while we wait or?

我宁可投井
I'd rather throw myself down a well.

哎哟 老爹 再往北走可没机会欣赏音乐了
Now now, grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading North.

因为北方人只懂狼嚎罢了!
The only music the Northerners know is the howling of wolves!

大人 真对不住 可咱们确实客满了
I'm sorry, My Lord. We're full up. Every room.

我的手下睡马厩就好
My men can sleep in the stable.

至于我嘛 我不需要多大的房间
As for myself, I don't require a large room.

大人 我们真是没办法
Truly, My Lord, we have nothing.

你们有没有办法…
Is there nothing I can do...

您可以将就我的房间
You can have my room.

到底还是有聪明人
Now there's a clever man.

吃的方面 应该没问题吧? 尤伦 跟我一起吃
You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.

好啊 大人 兰尼斯特大人!
Aye, My Lord. My Lord of Lannister!

我可否在您用餐时为您娱乐助兴? 
Might I entertain you while you eat?

让我唱一首歌颂令尊大人君临大捷的歌罢!
I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!

那我不反胃死才怪
Nothing would more likely ruin my supper.

好个意外的惊喜
What an unexpected pleasure.

很遗憾没能在临冬城见到您
I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.

我上次在此逗留时 还是徒利家的凯特琳
I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here.

爵士先生 您外衣上绣的可是赫伦堡的黑蝙蝠? 
You, Ser, is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?

家父是奔流城的霍斯特·徒利公爵 敢问河安夫人是不是他忠实的盟友? 
And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

红色骏马纹章向来受到奔流城的礼遇
The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun.

家父将裘诺斯·布雷肯伯爵视为 追随他最久也最忠心耿耿的封臣

Our lord is honored by his trust.

我羡慕令尊有这么多好朋友 史塔克夫人 但我不明白您这么做有何目的
I envy your father all his fine friends, Lady Stark, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.

修夫爵士在都城有亲戚吗? 
Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?

昨晚是我亲自替他守的灵
I stood vigil for him myself last night.

他没穿过盔甲
He'd never worn this armor before.

很不幸 他的对手是魔山
Bad luck for him going against the Mountain.

他怎么对上魔山的? 
Who determines the draw?

比武对阵是抽稻草签决定的 史塔克大人
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

可抽签是谁主持的呢? 
But who holds the straws?

辛苦了 姐妹们
You've done good work, sisters.

人生真是变化无常 曾几何时我们还在三叉戟河上各为其主
Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident.

我很庆幸没在战场上跟你交手 巴利斯坦爵士
I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.

做寡妇的滋味可不好受
I don't think the widow's life would suit her.

我亲眼见您斩杀了十几位著名的骑士
I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.

家父曾对我说 你是他见过的最棒的骑士
My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen.

在打仗这些事情上 他从没看走眼
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.

你父亲是个人才
He was a fine man, your father.

疯王对他做的那些 实在是可耻的罪行
What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.

那小伙子...  几个月前还仅是个侍从
And that lad he was a squire until a few months ago.

怎么置办得起一套新盔甲? 
How could he afford a new suit of armor?

或许艾林大人给他留了些钱吧? 
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?

听说国王打算参加今天的长枪比武
I hear the King wants to joust today.

他是想去 但这不可能
Yes, that will never happen.

劳勃向来是为所欲为
Robert tends to do what he wants.

如果听任国王为所欲为 国家将永无宁日
If the King got what he wanted all the time, he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.

这盔甲太小 陛下 穿不上
It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.

放屁 你老妈是个 大屁股的蠢婊子
Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass. Did you know that?

瞧这呆子! 没脑子 还缺个蛋!
Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.

连帮人穿盔甲都不会
He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.

是你太胖了 这才穿不下
You're too fat for your armor.

你对国王是这样讲话的吗? 
Is that how you speak to your King?

很好笑 是不是? 
That was funny, is it?

不好笑? 你不喜欢首相的笑话? 
No? You don't like the Hand's joke?

你就饶了这可怜孩子吧
You're torturing the poor boy.

听见首相的话了吗? 国王太胖了 穿不下盔甲
You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor.

去拿胸甲撑子快去啊!
Go find the breastplate stretchernow!

'胸甲撑子'? 
'The breastplate stretcher'?

他要花多久才能闹明白呢? 
How long before he figures it out?

或许你该为自己发明一套
Maybe you should have one invented.

好了 好了
All right, all right.

待会你看我的就是了 老子要露一手枪法
But you watch me out thereI still know how to point a Lance.

长枪比武与你无关 这是年轻人的事
You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.

怎么? 我是国王就不能打? 见鬼 我不过想打打人罢了!
Why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

那谁敢对你动手呢?  谁都行
And who's going to hit you back? Anybody who can.

反正最后坐在马鞍上的就是... 就是你
And the last man in his saddleWill be you.

七国上下没有人 敢冒触怒你的风险对你动手
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.

你的意思是那些胆小鬼会故意失手? 
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?

喝 我不渴
Drink. I'm not thirsty.

快喝 这是国王的命令
Drink. Your King commands it.

诸神在上 我竟然胖得穿不下自己的铠甲
Gods, too fat for my armor.

你的侍从... 是兰尼斯特家的人? 
Your squire... A Lannister boy?

哼 一个该死的白痴 瑟曦却坚持要我收下
Mm. A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted.

说来这都要感谢琼恩·艾林
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

我从前总以为当了国王就可以为所欲为
I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted.

罢了罢了 去看他们打吧
Enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride.

闻闻血腥味总可以吧
At least I can smell someone else's blood.

这副模样威武得过头了 嘿嘿? 
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

过来向你们的国王致敬! 快鞠躬 废物们!
Come, bow before your King! Bow, you shits!

艾莉亚呢?  去上她的舞蹈课了
Where's Arya? At her dancing lessons.

那是百花骑士

谢谢您 洛拉斯爵士
Thank you, Ser Loras.

可别让格雷果爵士伤了他
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

一百金龙币赌魔山赢

Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

十几桶多恩美酒? 
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

从里斯的妓院里搞一位名妓? 
Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?

你可以花钱替自己买个朋友嘛
Or you could even buy a friend.

洛拉斯爵士骑术超群
Ser Loras rides well.

可惜啊 小指头
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

我是真心想资助你买个朋友
It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.

告诉我 蓝利大人 你是啥时候勾搭上你这位'朋友'的呢? 
And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?

洛拉斯知道他那母马在发情
Loras knew his mare was in heat.

真是有心计
Quite crafty, really.

洛拉斯爵士才不会这么做
Ser Loras would never do that.

这么做毫无荣誉可言
There's no honor in tricks.

没有荣誉 但足以赢钱
No honor and quite a bit of gold.

以你们的国王之名! 立刻给我住手!
Stop this madness in the name of your King!

我欠您一条命 爵士阁下
I owe you my life, Ser.

这不是国王大道
This isn't the Kingsroad.

你说要去临冬城
You said we were riding for Winterfell.

我说了... 很多次 而且很大声
I did... Often and loudly.

把追兵引向 错误的方向
They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place.

Word's probably gotten to my father by now.

他会为此开出高额赏金
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

天下谁人不知: 兰尼斯特有债必还
Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts.

你可以行行好 帮我解开吗? 
Would you be so good as to untie me?

凭什么?  怎么
And why would I do that? Why not?

山上的原住民为了这双靴子就会杀我
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

如果我没教影子山猫吃掉的话
Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.

你现在该担心的不是影子山猫和原住民
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.

噢 朝东的路
Ah, the eastern road.

我们是要去谷地
We're going to the Vale.

去你妹妹那里 为着莫须有的罪名审判我
You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes.

你自己说 史塔克夫人 你有几年没见着你妹妹了? 
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister?

她从前只是有点神经兮兮 现在嘛...  你不如就地把我宰了
She was always a bit touched, but now you might as well kill me here.

我不是谋杀犯 兰尼斯特 我也不是!
I am not a murderer, Lannister. Neither am I!

谋害贵公子的事与我毫无瓜葛
I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.

那把匕首... 怎样的笨蛋 才会把自己的武器交给小贼使用? 
The dagger foundWhat sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?

要我堵住他的嘴吗?  为什么? 
Should I gag him? Why?

因为我的话让你开窍了? 
Am I starting to make sense?

我要是死了 你不就白跑一趟? 
If I die, what's the point?

我没事 夫人
I'll be fine, My Lady.

He'll never walk again.

但脑子还清醒? 
But his mind is sound?

我幼年时也身遭残疾
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

诸神关闭了一些门...
Some doors close forever...

却在不经意间为我打开了另一些门
Others open in the most unexpected places.

我告诉您的话若是传出去 我就得掉脑袋
If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head.

到时候谁会哀悼可怜的瓦里斯呢? 
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

天南地北 没有人会为蜘蛛歌唱啊
North or South, they sing no songs for spiders.

但有些事您必须知情
But there are things you must know.

您是御前首相 国王却是蠢才一个 我知道 您是他的挚友 您若不救他 这个蠢才注定完蛋
You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him.

我来都城一个月了
I've been in the capital a month.

你为何不早告诉我? 
Why have you waited so long to tell me this?

那你又为何转变了看法? 
So why do you trust me now?

监视着您一举一动的 不止是王后
The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely.

在都城里重荣誉的人屈指可数
There are few men of honor in the capital.

此外 您别见怪 我认为我自己也是其中之一
I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.

国王怎么个完蛋法? 
What sort of doom does the King face?

恐怕是与琼恩·艾林相似的方式
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

那东西叫'里斯之泪'
The tears of Lys, they call it.

非常罕见 价格高昂 味道清甜如水
A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water.

显然是某个与他亲近的朋友 但是哪一个呢? 
Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one?

艾林大人是个和蔼又值得信赖的人哪
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

他的一切都是琼恩·艾林给的
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

那个侍从? 修夫爵士? 
The squire, Ser Hugh?

他真是死不逢时 正要大展宏图 却...
Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.

如果说是修夫爵士下的毒...  又是谁收买他的呢? 
If Ser Hugh poisoned him who paid Ser Hugh?

显然是某个有钱人
Someone who could afford it.

琼恩生性平和
Jon was a man of peace.

他已经当了十七年的首相
He was Hand for 17 years

因为他开始问问题了
He started asking questions.

他已经找到了一个私生子
He's found one bastard already.

等查出真相 他会怎么做? 
And when he knows the truth, what will he do?

那群蠢蛋想杀他儿子
The fools tried to kill his son.

更糟的是 他们还搞砸了
What's worsethey botched it.

狼和狮很快就会打成一团
The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.

要开战了 我的老友 现在开战有什么用? 
We will be at war soon, my friend. What good is war now?

死了一个首相 为什么不能死第二个? 
If one Hand can die, why not a second?

如今的首相不一样
This Hand is not the other.

在儿子诞生前 卓戈卡奥是不会出兵的
Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.

你也清楚那些野蛮人是什么德行
You know how these savages are.

你叫我拖一拖 我却要叫你加快行动啊
'Delay,' you say. 'Move fast,' I reply.

这已经不再是两人对弈的游戏了
This is no longer a game for two players.

第一个上朝 最后一个离开
The first to arrive and the last to leave.

你的勤勉实在令人钦佩
I admire your industry.

我们都得有点特才嘛
We all have our qualities.

你今天看上去有点寂寞
You look a bit lonely today.

要不晚上去我的窑子耍一趟
You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.

今天有新来的童子
First boy is on the house.

恐怕我对这个没兴趣
I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.

那些天天在你耳边叽喳的小小鸟儿 他们是多可爱的小东西啊
All those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things.

放心 我可以安排各种娱乐
Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.

比如雷德温大人要的孩童就特别小
Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.

我是美的传播者和秘密的守护者 两者对我同等重要
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally important.

但我确实认为'美'是很主观的 不是吗? 
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?

腾石河的玛龙爵士偏好截肢残疾人
Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?

只要他出得起钱 又有什么不可以
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.

我还听过一个恶心的谣言 说某位陛下的最爱是新鲜尸体
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers.

安排这种娱乐想必很费劲吧
Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.

跑腿的可怜虫 得赶在漂亮尸体腐烂前找到他们
The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot.

严格意义上说 国王的律法禁止提供此类服务
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.

告诉我... 你的卵蛋是不是还 存在某地某人的某个小箱子里? 
Tell medoes someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box?

你我共事多年
Do you know I have no idea where they are?

你知道我对此一无所知
And we had been so close.

先别说我了 自从上次见面以来 你过得可好? 
But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?

自从上次你见到我 还是我见到你? 
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?

上次我见到你 你是在跟首相谈话
Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.

你亲眼所见?  我的眼线所见
Saw me with your own eyes? Eyes I own.

奈德·史塔克新官上任 千头万绪
We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.

你对史塔克夫人的一番深情厚谊 实在是打动人心
Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

假如说是你 让史塔克家得出了 兰尼斯特要对他们家孩子下手的结论
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion...

而这要让王后得知了只言片语...  后果真是不堪设想
To think a simple word to the Queen one shudders at the thought.

你可知道 我最后一次见到你 比你最后一次见到我要近得多
But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.

今天早些时候 我清楚地记得 你在史塔克大人房里跟他密谈
Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.

你藏在床下了吗? 
Was that you under the bed?

之后不久...  我又见你 陪同一位尊贵的外宾...
And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary...

其实你有狭海对岸的朋友不足为怪
Of course you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.

你自个儿就是打那边来的嘛
You're from there yourself, after all.

我们也是好朋友 对不对 瓦里斯大人? 
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

我可一直这么以为
I'd like to think we are.

你可以想象我此刻的心理负担 在朋友和国王之间左右为难
So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies.

于私不能出卖朋友 于公却又不能对不起国家...
To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm

噢 劳驾 站在这个十字路口上 这要让国王得知了只言片语...
Oh, please. To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King

你两个在勾兑什么呢? 
What are you two conspiring about?

算了 不管怎样 赶紧过来
Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up.

我老哥马上出席
My brother is coming.

出席御前会议? 
To a small council meeting?

远方传来了令人不安的消息
Disturbing news from far away.

快滚 不准乞讨
Off with you. No begging.

我不是乞丐 我住在这里
I'm not a beggar. I live here.

要我赏你两耳刮子才听得懂? 
D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?

我找我父亲
I want to see my father.

我还要搞王后咧
I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.

小子 你要你老爹
You want your father, boy?

去酒馆找去 他一定是喝醉了被伙计们拿来当尿壶使呢
He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.

我父亲是是御前首相!
My father is Hand of the King!

我不是小子 我是临冬城的艾莉亚·史塔克 你要是敢碰我 我老爸会把你们两个的头砍下来挂枪上
I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes.

现在你们是让我过去 还是要我赏你两耳刮子才听得懂? 
Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?

你知不知道我派出一半的卫士去找你? 
You know I had half my guard out searching for you?

你答应过我不再捣蛋了
You promised me this would stop.

他们说要杀你
They said they were going to kill you.

谁说的?  我没看清楚 但我想其中一个是胖子 噢 艾莉亚
Who did? I didn't see them, but I think one was fat. Oh, Arya.

我没说谎! 他们说你找到了私生子 还说狼和狮很快就会自相残杀 还说野蛮人...  说野蛮人如何如何
I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage.

你在哪里听到这些的?  在地城里 巨龙的头骨旁边
Where did you hear this? In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.

你在地城里做什么? 
What were you doing in the dungeons?

外面有个黑衣弟兄求见
There's a night's watchman here begging a word.

朋友 你叫什么名字?  叫我尤伦就好 大人
Your name, friend? Yoren, if it please.

这一定是您的公子 长得跟您真像
This must be your son. He has the look.

不 大人
No one sent me, My Lord.

我是来寻找把守长城的人手 看看地牢里有没有合适的人渣 好收罗去充军
I'm here to find men for the Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.

噢 我会为你安排的
Oh, we'll find recruits for you.

但这并非我此刻打扰您的原因
But that's not why I disturb you now.

您弟弟班扬流着黑衫军的血 我和您一样把他当成兄弟
Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours.

我正是为了他才飞速赶来
It's for his sake I rode here so hard

差点把我的马给累死了
I damn near killed my horse.

其他人也在往这边赶
There are others riding too.

到明天全城都会知道
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

咱们最好私下谈 大人
Best said in private, My Lord.

去吧 我们回头再把话说完
Go on. We'll talk more later.

乔里 带她回房
Jory, take her safely to her room.

小姐 走 你听见你父亲的吩咐了
Come along, My Lady. You heard your father.

我爸爸有多少侍卫? 
How many guards does my father have?

在君临吗? 有五十个
Here in King's Landing? 50.

你不会让别人杀他的 对不对? 
You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?

不用为这个担心 小姐
No fear on that count, little lady.

怎么回事?  大人 您夫人...
Well? It's about your wife, My Lord.

您离家可真远啊 史塔克夫人
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

在下是谷地的骑士瓦狄斯·伊根爵士
Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

艾林夫人跟您有约吗? 
Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?

我们事先来不及通知
There was no time to send word.

容我冒昧多问一句 夫人 他怎么会跟你在一起? 
May I ask, My Lady, why he is with you?

正是因为他 我们才来不及通知
That's why there was no time.

他是我的俘虏 他看起来可不像个俘虏
He is my prisoner. He doesn't look like a prisoner.

他的命运要交给我妹妹决定
My sister will decide what he looks like.

鹰巢城 都说它是攻不破的
The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.

给我十条好汉 几双钉鞋
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes

我铁定干翻这婊子
I'll impregnate the bitch.

史塔克大人 御前会议已经召开 请您不要缺席
Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.

我得先面见国王 单独晋见
I need to see the King firstalone.

国王陛下正在主持御前会议 大人
The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord.

是关于我夫人吗?  不 大人
Is it about my wife? No, My Lord.

似乎是丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的事
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

那贱货怀孕了
The whore is pregnant.

你这是谋害幼儿啊 这事我早警告过你 还在北境的时候我就说过 可你不肯听
You're speaking of murdering a child. I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

我要他们死 母子两个一起
I want 'em dead, mother and child both.

外加那个笨蛋韦赛里斯
And that fool Viserys as well.

这样说够明白了吧? 
Is that plain enough for you?

我要他们死
I want them both dead.

这事毫无荣誉可言 而你将为此遗臭万年
You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.

我要统治诺大的七国!
I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule!

一个国王 七大王国!
One King, Seven Kingdoms.

荣誉可能驾驭天下
Do you think honor keeps them in line?

维持统一吗!? 
Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace?

是恐惧 恐惧和鲜血!
It's fearfear and blood.

那你和疯王有什么区别? 
Then we're no better than the Mad King.

小心 奈德 小心你的嘴
Careful, Ned. Careful now.

因为八爪蜘蛛的捕风捉影 你就要暗杀一个小女孩? 
You want to assassinate a girl because the Spider heard a rumor?

并非捕风捉影 大人 公主怀孕的事不会错的
No rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.

消息来源呢? 
Based on whose information?

他现下是坦格利安兄妹的亲信
He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.

一个千里之外的叛徒的话也能当真? 
You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?

乔拉·莫尔蒙虽然贩卖奴隶 却不是叛徒
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.

当然 对一个重荣誉的人而言 这两者没什么区别
Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.

他触犯律法 背叛家族 是戴罪之身
He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.

我们岂能根据他的一面之辞去害人? 
We commit murder on the word of this man?

万一坦格利安的孽种 带着多斯拉克大军杀回来
A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army...

你怎么说?  狭海依旧隔在中间
What then? The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

等多斯拉克人教会他们的马 在水上走路那一天 我才会担心
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.

这就是你睿智的谏言吗? 
That's your wise advice?

干等敌人登岸了再说? 
Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?

你们是我的重臣 快发表意见!
You're my council. Counsel!

跟这满脑子荣誉的傻瓜讲讲道理
Speak sense to this honorable fool.

大人 凭良心说 我真的能体会您的顾虑
I understand your misgivings, My Lord.

我们考虑的是件可怕的事 卑鄙的事
Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing.

可我们这些冒昧为政的人 凡事必须以全国百姓福祉为优先考量
Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm.

若是天上诸神给丹妮莉丝一个儿子 王国就难免血光之灾
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.

我对这个女孩没有恶感 但若多斯拉克人大举入侵 会有多少无辜百姓死于非命? 
I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die?

多少城镇被付之一炬? 
How many towns will burn?

倘若死了她一个 能拯救万千生灵 会不会是比较明智 甚或比较仁慈的作法呢? 
Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?

他们兄妹早就该杀
We should have had them both killed years ago.

若你发现跟自己上床的原来是个丑女 最好闭上眼睛 赶紧办事
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with.

割了她喉咙 翻过这一页
Cut her throat. Be done with it.

这辈子我两次追随你上战场 出生入死 没有二话 没有犹豫
I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts.

但这次不行
But I will not follow you now.

跟我一起长大的劳勃 决不会在一个未出生的孩子的影子下颤抖
The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.

我决不当谋杀共犯
I will have no part in it.

史塔克大人 你是御前首相
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

你要么照我说的去做 不然我就另请高明
You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.

那我祝他好运
And good luck to him.

我以为你不是这种人
I thought you were a better man.

滚 滚回临冬城去
Go, run back to Winterfell!

否则我一定把你的头砍下来挂在枪上
I'll have your head on a spike!

我还要亲自动手 蠢货!
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

你以为你了不起 天下只有你知道爱惜荣誉!
You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable?

我要带女儿们提前动身
I'll go ahead with my daughters.

去让她们做好准备 你亲自去
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

不要找人帮忙 是 陛下
Don't ask anyone for help. Right away, My Lord.

贝里席大人求见
Lord Baelish is here for you.

今早上你走之后 陛下接着骂了一通
His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave.

话中可是出现了'叛国'字眼哟
The word 'treason' was mentioned.

你究竟来干什么? 
What can I do for you?

您打算何时回临冬城? 
When do you return to Winterfell?

怎么? 这与你何干? 
Why? What do you care?

傍晚时您若还留在城里
If you're still here come nightfall,

我便带您去见琼恩·艾林病倒前 探访过的最后一人
I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

如果您对此还感兴趣的话
If that sort of thing still interests you.

我没时间了
I don't have the time.

随您的便 花不了一小时的
It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.

集合所有卫士 在我女儿房外严密设防
Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers.

你手头最厉害的是谁?  韦尔跟海华
Who are your best two swords? Heward and Wyl.

叫他们在马厩等我
Find them and meet me at the stables.

你未经许可就把他带来这里
You bring him here without permission?

让他玷污我的门楣
You pollute my home with his presence?

罗宾 你姨妈干了件坏事 很坏的事
Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing.

你还记得她 对吗? 
You remember her, don't you?

他也很强壮 琼恩很清楚
And strong too. Jon knew it.

他的遗言就是'种性强韧'
His last words were 'the seed is strong.'

他要大家都知道 他儿子长大之后会变成个强壮的男子汉
He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.

你看 他现在是谷地之主
Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.

莱莎 是你写信说起兰尼斯特的事 警告我... 警告你离他们远点!
Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning meTo stay away from them!

不是叫你抓一个过来!
Not to bring one here!

他是坏人吗?  他是
Is that the bad man? It is.

他是兰尼斯特家的小恶魔提利昂
He's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister.

谋害你父亲的就是他
He killed your father.

他害死了国王的首相!
He murdered the Hand of the King!

哦 原来他也是我杀的? 
Oh, did I kill him too?

我还挺忙的
I've been a very busy man.

管紧你那张碎嘴!
You will watch your tongue!

这些都是谷地的骑士
These men are knights of the Vale.

个个对琼恩·艾林敬爱有加
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

个个都愿意为我牺牲性命
Every one of them would die for me.

我要有什么不测 我老哥詹姆绝对很乐意料理他们
If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do.

没有人敢在这里乱来! 妈咪 你告诉他!
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, mommy!

你快告诉他! 嘘 嘘 嘘 小宝贝
Tell him! Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.

他只是虚张声势
He's just trying to frighten us.

兰尼斯特家的人通通是骗子
Lannisters are all liars.

谁也别想欺负我的小亲亲
No one will hurt my baby.

我想看坏人飞
I want to see the bad man fly.

或许可以哦 小亲亲
Perhaps you will, my little love.

他是我的犯人
This man is my prisoner.

请不要伤害他!
I will not have him harmed.

瓦狄斯爵士 我姐姐的客人累了
Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary.

带他去'下面'休息休息
Take him down below so he can rest.

把他交给莫德
Introduce him to Mord.

睡吧 小矮人
You go sleep, dwarf man.

睡个好觉 小矮人儿!
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

史塔克公爵能保住脑袋真是万幸
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

劳勃会发几天火 但什么也不会做
Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything.

这安全吗 你确定? 
Are you sure this won't hurt?

你喜欢我这个样子? 
And you'd prefer me like this?

如果你喜欢没毛的 干嘛不找个小男孩
If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.

在我老哥眼中 没上过战场的都不算男人
My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

他始终把我当成被宠坏的孩子
He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child.

洛拉斯·提利尔 风光的百花骑士
Loras Tyrell, the knight of the flowers?

你打过多少仗了? 
How many wars have you fought in?

你那套铠甲花了你爹多少钱? 
Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?

劳勃和史坦尼斯只会唠叨我如何软弱 如何见了血就怕 团队比武中那小子的眼睛被打掉时 你确实吐了
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood you did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.

天哪! 他眼睛就在眼眶外头晃荡!
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!

没功夫就别上场呗
He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.

并非每个人都跟你一样是天才
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

我不是天才 没有谁天生会使剑
It's not a gift. No one gave it to me.

我厉害是出于勤奋 自能握木棍起 我天天练习
I'm good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick.

我也练过啊 我觉得就算我没日没夜地练 也不可能赶上你
I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.

是吗 说不定你能行呢
Yes well, I guess we'll never know.

全剃光?  全剃光
Everywhere? Everywhere.

会议的最终结果是? 
So how did it end up?

坦格利安女孩必须死? 
The Targaryen girl will die?

是的 虽然这令人嫌恶
It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

劳勃在这事上寸步不让
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

每当谈及这个女孩
Every time he talks about killing her,

我敢说桌子都被他的怒气掀起了六寸
I swear the table rises six inches.

可惜他对自己老婆没这么大热情
It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.

他对她的钱可是热衷不已
He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money.

这帮兰尼斯特真是让人不服不行 一方面他们傲慢乏味的程度无人可比 恐怕连诸神都难以忍受 另一方面又的确富可敌国
You have to give it to the Lannisters they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.

我们家也很富裕
I have an outrageous amount of money.

不及兰尼斯特
Not as much as the Lannisters.

但比你有钱啊
But a lot more than you.

劳勃又叫嚣说要带我去打猎
Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.

上次一去就是两星期
Last time we were out there for two weeks.

每天都淋着雨 在森林里跋涉 就为了陪他玩叉肉游戏
Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.

噢 劳勃就知道杀杀杀
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

他怎会当上国王呢?  别人打不过他呗
How did that ever happen? Because he loves his killing.

他从小就是万人敌
And he used to be good at it.

你知道谁才该称王吗? 
Do you know who should be king?

我父亲可以做你的后盾
My father could be your bank.

我没真正上过战场 但我愿意为你而战
I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.

劳勃当初在继承顺位上排老几? 
And where was Robert in the line of royal succession?

乔佛里是个怪物
Joffrey is a monster.

托曼才八岁 史坦尼斯? 
Tommen is eight. Stannis?

史坦尼斯比龙虾更无趣
Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

可他毕竟是我哥
He's still my older brother.

你干什么? ! 看 看哪
What are you doing?! Look at it.

一点血而已 我们体内有很多
It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

生活中免不了见点血
Sometimes a little spills.

你要当国王就得见很多很多血
If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this.

你必须习惯它
You need to get used to it.

愿意为你服务 因为你仁慈慷慨
They love to serve you because you're kind to them.

每个人都想接近你
They want to be near you.

你厌恶杀戮 但你懂得去做必须做的事
You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it.

且不为此沾沾自喜
You don't love killing.

有本书上说 权力是万恶之源
Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst?

王位是给那些 遭人憎恨 让人恐惧的人坐的
That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared?

但你不一样 你会成为绝代明君
You would be a wonderful King.

很遗憾你与奈德·史塔克的婚姻如此短命
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.

你们看上去挺般配的
You seemed so good together.

我总算做了件让你称心如意的事
I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.

国家没有首相 很快就会乱套
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.

我猜你是来劝我把职位 交给你弟弟詹姆罢
I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.

他办事太儿戏了
He's not serious enough.

如果说奈德·史塔克有什么好处
I'll say this for Ned Stark:

这样赶走他? 值得吗? 
Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?

如果坦格利安女孩能说服她那马王丈夫出兵 如果多斯拉克人渡过狭海...
If the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea...

我们将难以抵御
We won't be able to stop them.

孩童皆知多斯拉克人不懂航海
The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that.

他们没有纪律 没有盔甲
They don't have discipline. They don't have armor.

也没有攻城器械
They don't have siege weapons.

你是你父亲的传声筒
It's a neat little trick you do:

这些都是他的看法
You move your lips and your father's voice comes out.

假设韦赛里斯·坦格利安 带着四万多斯拉克哮吼武士登陆
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

我们只能退守城堡 因为这是明智之举 蠢货才会跟多斯拉克人在野外交战
We hole up in our castles a wise moveonly a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.

他们攻不下我们的城堡
They leave us in our castles.

但可以洗劫焚烧我们的村镇 杀死所有无法躲进石墙背后的人 我们的粮食和牲畜被抢光了 女人和孩子成为奴隶
They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.

试问七大王国的子民会支持 躲在高墙后面 对他们不闻不问的懦夫国王吗? 
How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls?

他们用不了多久就会认定 韦赛里斯·坦格利安才是真正的国王!
When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all?

可我们拥有数量优势
We still outnumber them.

告诉我 五和一 哪个大? 
Which is the bigger number: Five or one?

一支团结一心的军队 为一个共同的目标奋战
One armya real army united behind one leader with one purpose.

而我们的目标却随着疯王之死不复存在了
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

现在我们不过是 由一群同床异梦的家伙组成的乌合之众
Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse.

每个人都打着自己的算盘
And everybody wants something different.

你老爸想操控全世界
Your father wants to own the world.

奈德·史塔克想逃回家 埋进雪地里不闻世事
Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.

王国九年没打仗了
We haven't had a real fight in nine years.

相互背后捅刀子算不上真的打仗
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.

这个龌龊的国家
And that's all the realm is now:

这个属于小人 阴谋家 财迷和马屁精的国家
Backstabbing and scheming and arselicking and moneygrubbing.

有时候我很惊讶它还没有四分五裂
Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.

为王国安泰 熬了十七年
17 years later, holding it all together.

在仇恨煎熬中度过
How long can hate hold a thing together?

一晃整整十七年
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

你没问过她的情况 从没有
You've never asked about her, not once.

一开始 我觉得哪怕只提到她的名字 哪怕是悄悄地提 就又唤回了她
At first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her.

我以为只要不提她 终究能将她从你心底抹去
I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you.

当这一点愿望落空之后
When I realized that wasn't going to happen,

我是出于愤恨而不愿追问
I refused to ask out of spite.

我不愿成全你 不愿让你知道我对你有一丝一毫的关心
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask.

到最后连我的愤恨也与你无关了
And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

我发现你甚至还享受着我恨你这件事
As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.

因为莱安娜·史塔克的幽灵对我们造成的伤害 怎可能比我们之前上百次互相伤害的更深? 
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?

你想知道丑陋的真相吗? 
You want to know the horrible truth?

真相是我连她长什么样都不记得了
I can't even remember what she looked like.

我只知道她是我这辈子深爱的女人...
I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted...

却被人从我身边抢走 七大王国加在一起也无法填满我心中的空洞
Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

知道吗 我对你有过感情
I felt something for you once, you know?

即便失去第一个孩子以后
Even after we lost our first boy.

我仍然倾心于你 很长时间
For quite a while, actually.

我们之间就真的没可能? 
Was it ever possible for us?

你就没有一瞬间 一刹那对我有过感觉? 
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

你不想说点什么? 
Does that make you feel better or worse?

我无话可说
It doesn't make me feel anything.

大人 她跟他真像 不是吗? 
She looks like him, don't she, My Lord?

她有他的鼻子 他的黑发
She has his nose, his black hair.

大人 您见到他的时候...
Tell him when you see him, My Lord.

请您告诉他 她有多漂亮
If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.

请告诉他我没跟过其他人
And tell him I've been with no one else.

大人 我以新旧诸神之名起誓
I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new.

我不要金银珠宝 只要他的人
I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him.

国王对我一直很好
The King was always good to me.

琼恩·艾林来找你 所为何事? 
When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?

他不是来寻欢作乐的 大人
He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord.

他只是来看看孩子是否过得好 是否健康
He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.

她看来很健康
He looks healthy enough to me.

将来我们会关照她的
The girl shall want for nothing.

我发现买妓院比买船
Brothels make a much better investment than ships,

你对劳勃国王的私生子女所知多少? 
What do you know of King Robert's bastards?

这个嘛 从简单的说起 他生得比你多
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

多多少 有关系吗? 
How many Does it matter?

只要睡过的女人够多 总有人会送你大礼
If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.

琼恩·艾林把他们都找出来了 这又是为什么? 
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?

他是御前首相 想必劳勃要他代为照顾
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

国王是被父爱的光环笼罩了
He was overcome with fatherly love.

小小一群狼
Such a small pack of wolves.

休得无礼 爵士 这可是国王的首相
Stay back, Ser. This is the Hand of the King.

国王的前任首相
Was the Hand of the King.

现在嘛 不知他算老几 好象是某个偏远地方的领主
Now I'm not sure what he is lord of somewhere very far away.

兰尼斯特 你这是什么意思? 
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

为你安全着想 赶紧躲进去
Get back inside where it's safe.

我在找我老弟
I'm looking for my brother.

史塔克大人 您还记得我弟弟吧? 
You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark?

金头发 舌头利 个子矮
Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.

他似乎在路上碰到点麻烦
It seems he had some trouble on the road.

您该不会正巧知道是怎么回事吧? 
You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?

他是在我的命令下遭到逮捕 以为其罪行负责
He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.

我这就去找都城守备队
I'll bring the city watch.

我宁愿你死的时候手里拿着武器
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

你敢再威胁我家陛下... 威胁? 
If you threaten My Lord againThreaten?

杀了我 你弟弟也性命难保
You kill me, your brother's a dead man.

不许伤他... 把他手下给我全宰了!
Take him alive. Kill his men.

我弟弟 史塔克大人...  我们要你放人
My brother, Lord Stark we want him back.

请您原谅 陛下
Your pardon, Your Grace.

知道你老婆干了什么好事? 
Do you know what your wife has done?

她都是照我的意思做的
She did nothing I did not command.

她到底想些什么呢? 
Who'd have thought she had it in her?

你凭什么对我家人下手? 
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?

我是御前首相 以国王之名维护和平...
I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace...

你'曾经'是首相
You were the King's Hand.

现在你要为她的罪行负责
You shall now be held accountable.

行了行了 你两个都给我闭嘴!!
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?!

凯特琳必须释放提利昂 而你要跟詹姆和好
Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

他屠杀我的手下...
He butchered my men...

当时史塔克大人在妓院里喝得酩酊大醉 他的手下攻击詹姆
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.

安静 女人   詹姆逃出城去了
Quiet, woman.   Jaime has fled the city.

请允许我把他抓回来接受法律制裁
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

我当你是一国之君
I took you for a King.

你竟眼看着这个人赶走我的一个弟弟 绑架另一个
He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.

你应该穿裙子 我才该披挂上阵
I should wear the armor and you the gown.

我会把这当成荣誉的奖章
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.

那就安静地戴好 否则我让你更光荣
Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.

看到她是如何待我了? 
See what she does to me?

我不该打她的
I should not have hit her.

如果我们不作为 战争就会爆发
If we don't act, there will be a war.

所以我才要你老婆把小恶魔那畜生 赶紧放回君临
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.

她闹也闹够了 就这么结了吧
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

听见没? 派只鸟去 就这么结了
You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.

那詹姆・兰尼斯特的事又怎么说? 
And what about Jaime Lannister?

怎么处置詹姆?    妈的 王国欠了他老爸一屁股债
What about Jaime?   I'm half a Kingdom in debt to his bloody father.

我不知道你是怎么招惹上那帮黄毛的
I don't know what happened between you and those yellow  haired shits.

我也不想知道 我只在乎这个...
I don't want to know. This is what matters...

如果史塔克家和兰尼斯特家拔刀相向 这烂国家我就没法儿管了
I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats.

遵命 陛下
As you command, Your Grace.

我尽快返回临冬城处理善后事宜
I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.

见鬼 派只鸟去
Piss on that. Send a raven.

我是一国之君 我说怎样就怎样
I'm the King. I get what I want.

我不喜欢我的亲兄弟们
I never loved my brothers.

这是个可悲的事实
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

我选择了你做我的兄弟
You were the brother I chose.

算了 等我打猎回来再说罢
We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

让杀戮帮我醒醒脑子
Killing things clears my head.

这期间你得替我坐上铁王座 治理国家
You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.

你会比我更讨厌这玩意儿
You'll hate it more than I do.

坦格利安家那女孩...  七层地狱啊 你还提她干嘛? 
The Targaryen girl...  seven hells, don't start with her again.

那女孩必须死 我不想再谈
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

把章子戴上... 你要是敢再丢还给我
Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again,

我跟圣母发誓 会把这烂东西戴在詹姆・兰尼斯特身上
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

别跑太快   跑啊 小舞
Not too fast.   Come on, Dancer.

你打算何时告诉他? 
When are you gonna tell him?

血债血还   跑啊!
Blood for blood.   Come on!

你必须让兰尼斯特为乔里他们的死付出代价
You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.

你要我开战?    我要你为他们讨回公道
You're talking about war.   I'm talking about justice.

只有临冬城主 才可以召集封臣 率军出征
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.

兰尼斯特的人用长矛刺穿了你父亲的腿
A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.

弑君者大摇大摆地返回了凯岩城...  你要我进军凯岩城 兴师问罪么? 
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him...  you want me to march on Casterly Rock?

你已经不是孩子了   跑啊
You're not a boy anymore.   Come on.

他们袭击你父亲 他们挑起了战争
They attacked your father. They've already started the war.

而令尊缺席期间 你必须担起保护你家族的责任来
It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.

这并非你的责任 这也不是你的家族
And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.

我哪知道 这又不是我的家族
I don't know. It's not my House.

独自一个人在黑林子里迷了路
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

我不是一个人 我哥哥和我在一起
I'm not alone. My brother is with me.

他藏在你披风下面了吗? 
Got him hidden under your cloak?

啊 真是个漂亮别针
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

银子做的   我们要别针 还有你的马 下来
Silver.   We'll take the pin and the horse. Get down.

他被绑在马鞍上
The saddle... the straps.

怎么回事? 你残废了还是怎地? 
What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?

我是临冬城的布兰登・史塔克
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

你再不放开我 我便教你们通通没命!
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

把他小鸡鸡割下来塞他嘴里去
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.

这孩子死了就不值钱啦
The boy's worth nothing dead.

班扬・史塔克的亲属? 
Benjen Stark's own blood?

Think what Mance would give us.

去他妈的曼斯 去他妈的北境!

我们往南走 走得越远越好
We're going as far South as South goes.

到多恩就不会有异鬼来找麻烦了
There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.

放开他 我就放你们一条生路
Let him go and I'll let you live.

还好 我没感觉
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

在我们铁群岛 你亲手杀敌之前都不算男人
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy.

你疯了吗? 
Have you lost your mind?

没射中怎么办? 
What if you'd missed?

他会杀了你 再割布兰的喉咙
He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.

你无权... 无权什么? 无权救你弟弟的命吗? 
You don't have the right...   To what, to save your brother's life?

这是惟一的选择 所以我做了!
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

大人 求您饶我一命 我是您的人了
Give me my life, My Lord, and I'm yours.

留她一命吧
We'll keep her alive.

小矮人好吵!
Dwarf man making noise!

你想不想发财? 
How would you like to be rich?

小矮人还吵
Dwarf man still making noise.

我们有金子 很多金子
We have gold, lots of gold.

我打算给你一大笔金...
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

好吧 我身上没有
Well, I don't have it here.

今天我没心情训练
I don't want to practice today.

我才不要练这些笨蛋木剑呢!
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

烦恼的时候正是练剑的绝佳时机
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

战斗不会发生在你在草地上跟布娃娃 小猫咪过家家的时候
When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.

我才不要跟布娃娃和小...
I don't like dolls and k...

你的心深陷烦恼
You're with your trouble.

如果你带着烦恼打架
If you are with your trouble when fighting happens...

你就会更烦恼
...More trouble for you.

心不在焉的你...
How can you be quick as a snake...

... 又怎能迅如蛇...
...Or as quiet as a shadow...

... 静如影? 
...When you are somewhere else?

你在为你父亲担心 是不是? 
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

你会为他向神灵祈祷吗?    向新旧诸神
Do you pray to the gods?   The old and the new.

世上只有一个神 那就是死神
There is only one God and his name is Death.

我们对他也只有一句祷词: 
And there is only one thing we say to Death:

小子! 小子! 一个强壮的小子!
A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

她必须吃下整颗心吗? 
She has to eat the whole heart?

希望那别是我的马
I hope that wasn't my horse.

她不可能全吞下去
She'll never keep it down.

卓戈 卡奥
多斯拉克部族首领

告诉我她在说什么
Tell me what she's saying.

她会生下一个男孩
She's going to have a boy.

那孩子不是真正的坦格利安
He won't be a real Targaryen.

不是真龙
He won't be a true Dragon.

他是骑着世界的骏马
The stallion that mounts the world!

王子在我体内骑着马
A prince rides inside me.

我们将叫他雷戈!
And he shall be called Rhaego.

她终于成为了他们的王后
She truly is a queen today.

别让他们看见你在维斯・多斯拉克城中佩剑
Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

这些蛋不是你的
They don't belong to you.

她的就是我的
Whatever is hers is also mine.

卖一个蛋 我就能买到一艘船
If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship.

卖二个蛋 我能再买一支军队
Two eggs... a ship and an army.

你把三个蛋都偷走了   我需要一支所向披靡的军队
And you have all three.   I need a large army.

我是坦格利安王朝最后的希望了 莫尔蒙
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

那个历史上最伟大的王朝 我从五岁起就肩负着复兴它的重责大任...  但没有谁给过我 她在那个帐篷里得到的那些东西
The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old...  and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent.

我该如何完成自己的使命? 
How can I carry what I need to carry without it?

没有恐惧没有爱戴 如果我还是个穷光蛋 又怎能复国? 
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

瞧 你站在这里 一身正气荣誉的模样
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.

但别以为我没发现你盯着我妹妹的眼神
You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm?

别以为我不晓得你心里的盘算
Don't think I know what you want?

我无所谓 她归你了
I don't care. You can have her.

她可以继续当她的蛮子王后 尽情享用血淋淋的美味马肉 而你看上她哪点也可以去尽情享用
She can be Queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.

但蛋必须留下
You can't have the eggs.

你对我发过誓
You swore an oath to me.

忠诚二字在你眼中就一文不值么? 
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

忠诚在我眼中意味着一切
It means everything to me.

但你却不肯站开
And yet here you stand.

我不会站开
And yet here I stand.

金子的事...   没有金子!
About the gold...   No gold!

没有金子   听我说!
No gold.   Listen to me!

有时候眼光 要放长远...
Sometimes possession is an abstract concept...

他们抓我的时候把我的钱包搜走了 但里头的金子还是我的
When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.

在哪儿? 我不晓得在哪儿 不过只要我获得自由...
Where? I don't know where, but when they free me...

你听过这句俗话没
Have you ever heard the phrase

'跟兰尼斯特一样有钱'? 
'rich as a Lannister'?

你知道兰尼斯特家有很多金子
You know who the Lannisters are.

泰温公爵之子!
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

想必你还听过这句俗话: 
And of course, you have also heard the phrase,

只要帮我向艾林夫人传个口信 我就算欠你的债了
If you deliver a message from me...  to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.

等我逃过了这一劫... 我一定会的 我就给你很多很多金子
If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.

告诉她 我打算认罪
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

你有意认罪? 
You wish to confess your crimes?

天牢可以让任何人屈服
The sky cells always break them.

在天上诸神面前坦白罪行
Meet your gods as an honest man.

各位陛下夫人 我该从何说起呢? 
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

犯下的罪过数不胜数
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

撒谎行骗赌博嫖妓 无恶不作
I have lied and cheated...  gambled and whored.

我不会打架 但我擅长拿别人当枪使
I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.

您可能想听些具体事例吧? 
You want specifics, I suppose.

我七岁那年 见到一个仆女在河边洗澡
When I was seven I saw a servant girl bathing in the river.

她只好光着身子 眼泪汪汪地回城堡
She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears.

还能看见她的奶子蹦啊蹦的
I can still see her tits bouncing.

十岁那年 我把叔叔的靴子填满了羊屎
When I was 10 I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

事后还矢口否认 嫁祸给某位侍从
When confronted with my crime,

那可怜的孩子因此挨了鞭打 我却逃脱了惩罚
I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice.

在一罐海龟汤前掏出了裤裆里的鳗鱼
I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.

我猛搓这独眼蛇
I flogged the one  eyed snake.

剥开香肠皮
I skinned my sausage.

把秃头哭出的泪水 滴进了汤汁里头 这汤是给我老姐喝的
I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate.

至少我希望她喝了
At least I hope she did.

还有回我带了一头蠢驴和一个蜂窝 进了妓院...   住嘴!
Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel...   Silence!

你以为你在干什么? 
What do you think you're doing?

我在认罪啊
Confessing my crimes.

提利昂大人 你被控派人行刺我卧病在床的儿子布兰 以及密谋害死我妹夫
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband

国王之手琼恩・艾林大人
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

我对杀人可是一窍不通
I don't know anything about all that.

你闹也闹够了
You've had your little joke.

想必玩得很愉快
I trust you enjoyed it.

莫德 带他回地牢
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

这次找个更小...
But this time find a smaller cell...

地板更斜的房间给他
With a steeper floor.

艾林谷里 到底还有没有天理? 
Is this how justice is done in the Vale?

你控告 我否认
You accuse me of crimes,

你就把我扔进天牢 挨饿受冻
I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve?

请问国王的正义到哪里去了? 
Where is the King's Justice?

我要求公平审判!
I am accused and demand a trial!

要是审判结果你的确有罪 那么依照国王的律法 你只有死路一条
If you're tried and found guilty, then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.

我很清楚国王的律法
I understand the law.

鹰巢城里没有刽子手
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

我们的方式更优雅
Life is more elegant here.

兰尼斯特大人 你要审判
You want a trial, My Lord Lannister.

你想说什么 我儿子都会倾听 接着你将接受他的判决
My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment.

然后... 你要么走大门
Then you will leave...

不然就从这个门出去
By one door or the other.

无需惊动罗宾大人
No need to bother Lord Robin.

我要求比武审判
I demand a trial by combat.

夫人 求您恩准我
My Lady, I beg the honor.

为您而战
Let me be your champion.

这份荣耀应该归我所有
The honor should be mine.

看在我对您夫君敬爱有加的份上 让我替他报仇罢
For the love I bore your Lord husband, let me avenge his death.

我愿为您而战 夫人   这将是我的荣幸
I'll fight for you, My Lady.   It'll be my honor.

我的荣幸...   我要看坏蛋飞!
The honor should be mine.   Make the bad man fly!

你就不想为我夫君报仇雪恨吗? 
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

我全心全意地敬爱他 夫人
With all my heart, My Lady.

但小恶魔只有我一半高
But the Imp is half my size.

宰杀这种人还叫主持正义 那太可耻了
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.

要求比武审判的也是你
You demanded a trial by combat.

这会儿我还要像你一样 给自己找个代理骑士
Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.

我很乐意为您迎战小恶魔的代理骑士
I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

恐怕这是不智之举 爵士先生
I wouldn't be too glad, Ser.

我指名我哥哥詹姆・兰尼斯特
I name my brother Jaime Lannister.

弑君者 离此有几百里
The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.

派只鸟把他找来 我很乐意等
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

你今天就得接受审判
The trial will be today.

有谁愿意为我而战? 
Do I have a volunteer?

可以认定没人愿意为...
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

我代侏儒上场罢
I'll stand for the dwarf.

要酒吗 陛下? 
More wine, Your Grace?

我刚才说到哪儿来着   单纯的时代
What was I saying?   Simpler time.

对! 单纯的时代 你太小不记得
It was! It was. You're too young to remember.

那时候真叫个单纯 是不是 塞尔弥? 
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

是的 陛下   恶贯满盈的对手 堂堂正正地等着你 跟他大战三百回合
It was, Your Grace.   The enemy was right in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.

听起来很欢乐   欢乐? 是很欢乐
It sounds exhilarating.   Exhilarating, yes.

比你热衷的那些 化装不化装的舞会欢乐多了
Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw.

你上过河间地的妞吗? 
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

似乎? 这种事怎么能忘
You think? I think you'd remember.

我们那时代 没把七大王国的妞全上过一遍就不算男人 七国外加河间地
Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands.

这叫'大杀八方'   你临幸了不少妞儿
We used to call it 'making the eight.'   Those were some lucky girls.

你有没完成'大杀八方' 巴利斯坦? 
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

微臣惭愧 陛下
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

维斯特洛一分为二 百万人在战火中丧生的时代? 
The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?

或是在此之前 疯王跟随自己脑子的疯狂声音 肆意屠杀妇女儿童的时代? 
Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?

或是更早 恶龙把城市烧成灰烬的时代? 
Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?

你是我弟弟 但我是你的国王
You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.

烂醉如泥的你
I suppose it was all rather heroic...

掏出那话儿干了某个可怜的河间地妓女 完成了大杀八方的伟业! 真他妈英勇!
If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight.

要酒吗 陛下? 
More wine, Your Grace?

他们在河间地四处放火
They burned most everything in the Riverlands:

我们的田地谷仓和家园 都被他们烧掉了
Our fields; Our granaries; our homes.

他们抓走我们的女人... 一遍又一遍地凌辱
They took our women, then they took 'em again.

发泄完以后 像宰牲口一样把她们杀死
When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals.

他们把沥青 浇在孩子们身上 再将他们活活烧死
They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.

看来是土匪
Brigands, most likely.

他们不是强盗
They weren't thieves.

不是来抢东西的
They didn't steal nothing.

他们甚至把东西给留下了 陛下
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

听取请愿的是御前首相 不是国王本人
It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King.

鱼 徒利家族的纹章
Fish. The Sigil of House Tully.

这不就是尊夫人的本家吗 我的好大人? 
Isn't that your wife's house... Tully, My Lord Hand?

这帮人 他们有没有家徽? 
These men, were they flying a Sigil?

有没有打旗帜?    没有 陛...
A banner?   None, your...

只是那领头的...
The one who was leading them...

他比我见过最高的人还高上一尺 我亲眼见他把我们的铁匠劈成两半 他只需一剑 就能生生切下马头
Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.

这人我们好象认识
That sounds like someone we know.

你描绘的是格雷果・克里冈爵士
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

格雷果爵士何必去打家劫舍? 
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

他可是涂抹过圣油的骑士啊
The man is an anointed knight.

都说他是泰温・兰尼斯特的疯狗
I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

相信你也听说了
I'm sure you have as well.

兰尼斯特家 会因为什么 而对尊夫人动怒呢? 
Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?

你认为兰尼斯特家 会公然袭击 国王保护下的村庄吗?  这...   这就跟光天化日之下在都城大街上 袭击御前首相一样让人无法容忍
If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the King's protection, it would be...   That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.

我无法归还你们的家园 更不能让死者复生 但或许能以劳勃国王之名 还你们一个迟来的公道
I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our King, Robert.

贝里・唐德利恩伯爵
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

你带上一百人 即刻前往格雷果爵士的城堡   悉听尊令
You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.   As you command.

以安达尔人和先民的国王 七国统治者
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name,

暨全境守护者 拜拉席恩家族的劳勃一世之名
King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,

我命令你们 制裁虚伪的骑士格雷果・克里冈 以及所有与他合谋的共犯
I charge you to bring the King's Justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes.

我在此宣告 褫夺其骑士身份
I denounce him and attaint him.

褫夺其一切官阶与职衔 收回其一切封地税赋和房产 并明令处之以死刑   大人啊...
I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.   My Lord...

这... 这么做是不是太激进了? 
This... this is a drastic action.

我们还是等劳勃国王回来再定夺吧
It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.

派席尔大学士   大人
Grand Maester Pycelle.   My Lord.

请派一只乌鸦去凯岩城
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

召泰温・兰尼斯特火速入朝 为其封臣的罪行做出解释
Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

如果他在两周之内不能现身 就是自承叛党 为国王之敌
He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.

大人 您的处置很有魄力 也值得钦佩
A bold move, My Lord, and admirable.

但是狮子尾巴不好踩啊
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

泰温・兰尼斯特可是七国上下最富有的人
Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.

打起仗来 金钱比士兵更重要
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

那为什么做国王的是劳勃 却不是他泰温・兰尼斯特? 
Then how come Robert is King and not Tywin Lannister?

打他 打他!   上啊 瓦狄斯爵士!
Attack attack!   Come on, Ser Vardis!

胆小鬼 有种就光明正大地打!
Stand and fight, coward!

瓦狄斯爵士 打够了! 快收拾他!
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

你怎么了? 站起来啊!
What are you doing? Get up!

起来 起来 站起来!
Get up, get up, get up!

快举剑 举剑!
Raise your sword. Raise it!

起来!   快站起来!
On your feet!   Get up!

起来战斗 瓦狄斯爵士!
Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!

你这样打毫无荣誉可言!
You don't fight with honor!

现在我可以让那个小坏蛋飞了吗? 
Can I make the little man fly now?

这个小坏蛋要回家了
This little man is going home.

你身上有我的东西罢
I believe you have something of mine.

兰尼斯特有债必还
A Lannister always pays his debts.

你把头发盘成了南方小姐的式样
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.

是啊 怎么了? 我们在南方住
Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.

可你要始终牢记自己来自哪里
It's important to remember where you come from.

你母亲不见得会欣赏你的新发型
I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.

我母亲也不是北方人
My mother isn't from the North.

你头巾下面有头发吗
Do you even have hair under there?

话说你是哪儿的人? 南方人还是北方人? 
Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?

我的家乡是一个小村庄 它坐落在...
I come from a very small village in...

这个也与我无关
I just realized I don't care.

你越来越没礼貌了
Now you are being rude.

我承认我最近几周的言行 实在很粗鲁
I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks.

可以吗? 
With your permission?

它真漂亮 它就跟你母亲戴的那个一样
It's beautiful, like the one your mother wears.

将来你是王后
You'll be queen someday.

只有它才配得上你
It's only fitting you should look the part.

你能原谅我的粗鲁举止吗? 
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

我没什么好原谅的啊...
There's nothing to forgive.

有朝一日 我们会在王座厅里成亲
One day we'll be married in the throne room.

七国上下的陛下夫人们都会到场参加 从北方的最后壁炉城 到南方的盐海岸 届时你将母仪天下
Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them.

我再也不会欺负你
I'll never disrespect you again.

再也不会亏待你了
I'll never be cruel to you again.

你相信我吗? 
Do you understand me?

我会永远爱护你 从今天 直到永远
You're My Lady now, from this day until my last day.

你干什么?    我要去君临
What are you doing?   Going to King's Landing.

我会在白港找条船
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.

付得起船费么? 
And you can afford that?

我有些客人比某人可大方多了
Some of my friends are more generous than others.

你这种货色 君临城里怕是有上千个
There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.

这么说 我不会寂寞啦
So I'll have lots of company.

哼 你会出人头地...
Yes, you'll be very popular...

然后就会有哪个胖陛下找上门 脑满肠肥 鸡巴却小 硬不起来就把你揍得满地找牙
Until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.

我就算留下又怎样? 
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

还能成为葛雷乔伊夫人 成为铁群岛的女主人吗?    别傻了
Will I become Lady Greyjoy, mistress of the Iron Islands?   Don't be a fool.

我听说詹姆・兰尼斯特在君临的大街上 袭击了史塔克公爵
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing.

很快 方圆百里的男人都会被征集参军 恐怕大都将一去不返
Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back.

我在这里已经没生意可做了
There's nothing left for me here.

让我看最后一眼!
Let me see it one more time!

我会想你的
I'm going to miss you.

我准备送你们回临冬城
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

那乔佛里怎么办?    你是不是腿伤好不了了
What about Joffrey?   Are you dying because of your leg?

所以才送我们回家? 
Is that why you're sending us home?

求求你 父亲大人 求求你别这样
Please, father. Please don't.

不要 我还要跟西利欧上课呢
You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio.

我好不容易才有一点进步
I'm finally getting good.

这不是惩罚
This isn't a punishment.

我是为了你们的安危考虑才送你们回去
I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.

我们可以带西利欧一起走吗? 
Can we take Syrio back with us?

谁理你的笨舞蹈老师啊? 
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?

我是要嫁给乔佛里王子的
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.

我爱他 我想作他的王后 为他生孩子   七层地狱啊
I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen and have his babies.   Seven hells.

等你长大
When you're old enough,

我会找个配得上你的人 勇敢温柔又强壮...
I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong...

我才不要什么勇敢温柔又强壮的人 我只要他!
I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him!

他会成为有史以来最伟大的国王 一头黄金狮子 我们会有许多漂亮的金发儿子
He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.

笨蛋 他不是狮子
The lion'sot s Sigil, idiot.

他跟他老爸一样是鹿
He's a stag, like his father.

他才不是! 他一点都不像那酒鬼老国王
He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk King.

去吧 姑娘们 叫修女帮你们收拾行李
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start packing your things.

哪儿啊? 老子来参加她的喜宴啦
Where is she? I'm here for the feast.

小贱货的喜宴   过来
The whore's feast?   Come.

把你的手拿开!
Get your hands off me!

谁也不准触碰真龙!
No one touches the Dragon!

酸腿卡奥倒是还能走嘛
The sore  foot king. He walks.

我是来参加晚宴的
I'm here for the feast.

你的座位在那里
There is a place for you.

卓戈卡奥说你的座位在那里
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

那不是国王坐的地方
That is no place for a King.

把剑收起来 你会把我们通通害死
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

他们不能在圣城里流血
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

我只要属于我的东西
I want what I came for.

我只要他答应我的那顶王冠
I want the crown he promised me.

却没有付钱
But he never paid for you.

叫他遵守约定 否则我就要收回你
Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.

他可以留下他的种
He can keep the baby.

我会把那野种割下来给他
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

我会把他恳求的东西赐给他
I will give to him what he wants.

我要赐他一顶黄金王冠 世人会为此景战栗不止
I will give to him a golden crown and men will tremble when they will see it.

你将会拥有一顶...
You shall have a golden crown...

任谁看了都会颤抖的黄金王冠
That men shall tremble to behold.

我要的只是这个
That was all I wanted.

他答应要给我的
What  what was promised.

不行! 你们不准碰我
No! You cannot touch me.

我是真龙 真龙!
I am the Dragon. I am the Dragon!

我要我的王冠!
I want my crown! Ahh!

请您转过头 卡丽熙   不
Look away, Khaleesi.   No.

真龙不怕火
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.

... 即刻入朝为汝之封臣 格雷果·克里冈
'Summoned to court to answer for the crimes the Mountain'...

所犯之暴行 承担罪责 限期两周抵达 否则便是自承叛党
Uh, 'arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown.'

有勇气 没脑子
Brave man, terrible judgment.

袭击他是件蠢事
Attacking him was stupid.

兰尼斯特家的人 不干蠢事
Lannisters don't act like fools.

你觉得自己办得聪明? 
Are you gonna say something clever?

说吧 你哪里聪明了? 
Go on, say something clever.

凯特琳·史塔克抓了我弟弟
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

那他为什么还活着? 
Why is he still alive?

我正准备解决他...  有个手下插手 刺穿了他的腿
One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.

他为什么还活着? 
Why is he still alive?

这样杀他不光彩 光彩? 
It wouldn't have been clean. Clean.

你太在乎 别人怎么看你了
You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.

我不在乎别人怎么看我
I could care less what anyone thinks of me.

你以为你做得到吗? 
That's what you want people to think of you.

也就是说你能接受
When you hear them whispering

别人在背后指指点点 叫你'弑君者'? 
'Kingslayer' behind your back doesn't it bother you?

我不接受
Of course it bothers me.

为什么狮子要在意 绵羊的看法? 
The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

是不是我还得感谢你的虚荣 帮咱们家躲过一场冲动引发的灾祸? 
I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.

这里有三万军队
I'm giving you half of our forces

我要你踏平凯特琳·徒利的娘家 让她领教兰尼斯特 有债必还
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.

想不到你挺在乎我弟弟的
I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.

即便是最低贱的兰尼斯特 也是我们中的一员
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.

而对手每关押他一天 我们的威信就减弱一分
And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.

所以说狮子还是在意...
So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of

不 这不是在意 这是我们昭告天下的公理: 
No, it's not an opinion. It's a fact.

决不容忍任何家族冒犯我们之后 能够全身而退 我们要让全天下畏惧
If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared.

我早晚也会离去
Before long I'll be dead.

甚至你 你弟弟 你姐姐和她所有的孩子 终有一天也要尽归尘土
And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children. All of us dead; all of us rotting in the ground.

只有家族将永世长存
It's the family name that lives on.

繁衍不息
It's all that lives on.

你个人的荣耀 个人的得失在家族面前 都不值一提
Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.

诸神让你生来武艺超群
You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.

诸神让你降生于七国中最强大的家族
You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.

而你现在还年轻
And you are still blessed with youth.

但你看看自己是怎么挥霍青春的 嗯? 
And what have you done with these blessings, huh?

你自以为光鲜地去为两任国王当保镖...  结果一个是疯子 一个是酒鬼
You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings one a madman, the other a drunk.

现下家族兴衰在此一举
The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.

未来几个月 我们要么建立一个千年王朝...
We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.

要么像坦格利安家一样灰飞烟灭
Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.

我要你挣开枷锁 肩负使命
I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.

不是明年 不是明天
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

我受过更重的伤 陛下
I've had worse, My Lady.

或许你该回家去
Perhaps it's time to go home.

南方不是你该待的地方
The South doesn't seem to agree with you.

我知道琼恩·艾林是为什么死的
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

你就为这把我叫来? 跟我猜谜语? 
Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?

他打过你吗? 
Has he done this before?

詹姆会跟他拼命
Jaime would have killed him.

我弟弟胜过你朋友一千倍
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

坦格利安家三百年来都是兄妹通婚 以保持血统纯正
The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.

詹姆和我不只是姐弟
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.

一起降世 我俩属于彼此
We came into this world together. We belong together.

我儿子看见你跟他在一起
My son saw you with him.

你很爱你的孩子 对不对? 
Do you love your children?

全心全意 我也是这么爱着自己的孩子
With all my heart. No more than I love mine.

都是詹姆的孩子 感谢天上诸神
And they are all Jaime's. Thank the Gods.

即便劳勃偶尔能远离那些婊子 喝完酒跌跌撞撞地找到我的床
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

我也有其他方法满足他
I finish him off in other ways.

反正第二天早上他就会忘得一干二净 你一直恨着他
In the morning, he doesn't remember. You've always hated him.

恨着他? 我仰慕他
Hated him? I worshipped him.

他是当年七国每个女孩的梦中情人 而他发了婚誓 他属于我
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.

婚礼当天 我们一同步入贝勒大圣堂 看见他黑须髯髯 精壮勇武的样子 那是我一生中最幸福的时刻
And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and blackbearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.

可那天晚上他压在我身上 浑身酒臭 办那一丁点儿事... 真的是一丁点儿事的时候 他在我耳边悄悄念道'莱安娜'
Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he didwhat little he could do and whispered in my ear, 'Lyanna.'

你妹妹尸骨已寒 我却是活生生的女子 他却依然爱她不爱我
Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.

等国王打猎归来 我准备把事情原原本本地告诉他
When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

在这之前你一定得走... 带着孩子一起
You must be gone by thenyou and your children.

我不愿沾上他们的鲜血
I will not have their blood on my hands.

你能跑多远就跑多远 能带多少人就带少人
Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.

因为即便你逃到天涯海角
Because wherever you go,

劳勃的怒火也会尾随而至
Robert's wrath will follow you.

那我的怒火又怎么说 史塔克大人? 
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

当初你只需伸手便可夺取天下
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

詹姆跟我说过 君临城陷那天
Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.

你发现他坐在铁王座上 便要求他交出王位
He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.

你当时为什么不爬上阶梯? 
All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.

我这辈子犯过许多错 这却不是其中之一
I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.

在权力的游戏之中 你不当赢家 就只有死路一条
When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.

没有中间地带
There is no middle ground.

北方的老板就是这样调教你的吗? 
Is that what they teach you up in the North?

还有你 不管你是打哪儿来的 知不知道你叫得多滑稽? 
And youwherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

你们是不是听不明白我的话? 
Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?

那就重来
Let's start over, shall we?

这回你当男 她扮女
You be the man and you be the woman.

别当客人是傻瓜 他们为你付过钱
You're not fooling them. They just paid you.

他们知道你是什么货色
They know what you are.

他们知道一切都是逢场作戏
They know it's all just an act.

你的任务是要让他们忘掉这些
Your job is to make them forget what they know.

你不只是装模作样
He's winning you over in spite of yourself.

你确实让他觉得很爽
You're starting to like this.

他渴望你的表演
He wants to believe you.

自从他懂得自娱自乐起 他就宠着他那话儿
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it.

不是吗?  他自信比别的男人强
Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men.

现在他有了证据
He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.

他太伟岸了 只有他能进到你的深处 无人开发过的地方 释放出你的全部欲望
He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.

你干嘛不来亲自教我们呢 大人? 
Why don't you join us, My Lord?

我心里念着一个女人
I'm saving myself for another.

没关系 她又不知道这里的事儿
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

我们不知道的事往往会引来杀身之祸
What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.

她一定有倾国倾城的容貌喽? 
She must be very beautiful.

倒也不是 只是血统绝对高贵无暇
No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.

大人您真的谈恋爱了啊
I do believe My Lord's in love.

我爱了她很多年 可以说大半辈子
For many years. Most of my life really.

她也喜欢我
And she loved me too.

她把我当成小跟班 小玩伴
I was her little confidant, her plaything.

她对我畅所欲言 无话不谈
She could tell me anything, anything at all.

她告诉我 她喜欢哪些马 憧憬哪些城堡 还有她想嫁给谁
She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry.

那是一个北方佬 生着一个铁砧模样的下巴
A northerner with a jaw like an anvil.

知道这个消息后 我找他决斗
So I challenged him to a duel.

为什么不呢? 故事里不都这样写着么? 
I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.

在故事里 小英雄总能打败大坏蛋
The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.

但在我的故事里 结局是她央求他不要杀我
In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.

她说'他只是个孩子'
'He's just a boy,' she said.

于是他只在我身上留了一道小疤作纪念 便带她扬长而去 他们后来结婚了? 
So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by and off they went. Is she still married to him?

卤莽让他在结婚前就送了命
He got himself killed before the wedding...

她跟了他弟弟 一个更严肃的道德楷模
..And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.

似乎她还日久生情了
She loves him, I'm afraid.

谁能怪她呢? 谁能跟他比呢? 
And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him?

你知道输掉决斗让我明白了什么吗? 
Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?

我明白了那是他们的游戏 按照他们的规则 我永远也赢不了
I learned that I'll never win, not that way. That's their game, their rules.

我不会再找他们决斗了
I'm not going to fight them.

我要在自己的地盘 用自己的方式
I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know.

只有看清了自己 才能得到自己想要的东西
And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.

您想要什么? 
And what do you want?

噢 一切 亲爱的
Oh, everything, my dear.

现在去洗干净 你两个今晚都要接客
Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.

知道么 你是个幸运的女孩
You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?

在我故乡 我们对罪犯从不心慈手软
Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.

在我故乡 你这路货色若是敢抢劫小少爷
Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord?

会在退潮时被仰面栓在沙滩上 用木桩和铁链固定住四肢
At low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes.

潮水会一点点地涨上来
The sea would come in closer and closer.

每分每秒 死神一寸一寸地逼近...
You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.

你的故乡是哪儿啊? 
Where is it you come from?

怎么? 你没听说过铁群岛? 
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

相信我 你也没听说过我的故乡
Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.

这里不是没开化的蛮夷之地
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

在文明人的国度 你得学会用适当的称号来称呼陛下们
In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.

什么称号?  大人
And what's that? Lord.

这还不明显吗? 
What do you mean why?

我父亲是巴隆·葛雷乔伊 铁群岛的大王
My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.

那跟你有啥关系? 
What's that got to do with you?

你父亲是大王 所以你当自己也是大王? 
If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?

我会继承父亲的权位...  所以你现在还不是大王嘛
I will be lord after my father so you're not lord now?

你故意跟我作对 是不是? 
You having a go at me? Is that it?

我只是闹不明白你们南方人咋想的罢了
I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.

我不是南方人 你住在长城以南
I'm not a Southerner. You're from South of the wall.

对我来说你就是南方人
That makes you a Southerner to me.

你这放肆的小婊子
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

不明白啊 大人
Couldn't say, My Lord.

闹不明白'放肆'这个词是啥意思
Don't know what 'impunent' means.

放肆 就是粗鲁 没礼貌
Impudent. It means rude, disrespectful.

你想不想除掉镣铐? 
Do you want to lose that chain?

这位女士是我们的客人
The lady is our guest.

我以为她是我们的俘虏
I thought she was our prisoner.

怎么 这两者矛盾吗? 
Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?

再发生这种事 我就不一定在场了
Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.

我见过的混蛋多的是
I'm used to worse than him.

他这样的毛头小子要落在那帮混蛋手里 准教被一口吞下 还拿他的骨头剔牙
I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.

你来此是要做什么? 
Why did you come here?

我压根儿不想来这里
Didn't mean to come here.

我们打算一路逃往南方
Meant to get much further South than this.

越往南越好 赶在长夜降临之前
As far South as South goes, before the long night comes.

为什么? 你们在害怕什么? 
Why? What are you afraid of?

昼伏夜出的东西
There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.

也就是猫头鹰 影子山猫和...
Owls and Shadowcats and

我指的不是猫头鹰和影子山猫
I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.

你暗示的那些 几千年前就消失了
The 'things' you speak of they've been gone for thousands of years.

他们没有消失 老头
They wasn't gone, old man.

而现在他们醒了
And they ain't sleeping no more.

其实我没跟她们说过话 说不来话
Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.

看着就好 还能听她们嘻笑
Just looking at them, hearing them giggle.

你就不想姑娘吗? 
Don't you miss girls?

吹号 咱们得去吹号
The horn. We have to blow the horn.

一声号角代表兄弟归来 两声代表野人逼近 三声... 只有一匹马
One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three forthere's no rider.

这是我班扬叔叔的马
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

劳勃他... 我们当时...  在猎野猪...
It's Robert. We were hunting a boar

我应该多陪着你 教导你如何成为男子汉
I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.

我不是个好父亲
I was never meant to be a father.

你没必要看下去
You don't want to see this.

酒喝多了 结果没射中
Too much wine, missed my thrust.

这就是死亡的臭气
It stinks like death.

别以为我闻不出来
Don't think I can't smell it.

我也没让那王八蛋好过 奈德
I paid the bastard back, Ned.

我一刀捅进它脑子里
I drove my knife right through his brain.

你问问他们是不是真的... 问哪!
You ask them if I didn't. Ask them!

我要我的葬礼宴会成为 七国有史以来最风光的
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

我要让所有人都尝尝这头干掉我的野猪
And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.

你们都退下 我跟奈德谈谈
Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.

劳勃 亲爱的... 退下! 都退下!
Robert, my sweetOut, all of you!

拿纸笔来 就在那边桌上 把我说的写下: 
Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.

吾 拜拉席恩家族的 劳勃一世... 把他妈那些鬼头衔通通放进去
'In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of' you know how it goes.

你知道是哪些
Fill in the damn titles.

史塔克家族的艾德...  头衔... 头衔...
Eddard of House Stark' titles, titles

为摄政王及全境守护者 自吾死后...  ... 代吾统理国事 俟吾儿乔佛里成年
'to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death, to rule in my stead until my son Joffrey comes of age.'

等我死了 把这个交给御前会议
Give it to the council after I'm dead.

至少 人们会说我这辈子做的最后一件事 没有错
At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.

你会比我更讨厌治理...  但你会做得很好
You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.

你说得没错 瓦里斯 小指头 我弟弟... 废物们...
You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother... Worthless.

除了你 没人敢对我说一个'不'字
No one to tell me 'no' but you.

阻止他们... 如果还来得及
Stop it, if it's not too late.

让他变成比我更好的人
Make him better than me.

为了你 我会尽我所能
I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.

为了这个被猪拱死的国王 劳勃·拜拉席恩? 
King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.

给我止痛的东西 让我去死罢
Give me something for the pain and let me die.

给他罂粟花奶
Give him milk of the poppy.

陛下醉得站都站不稳
He was reeling from the wine.

还是命令我们...  站一边去
He commanded us to step aside, but...

谁也没法阻止国王伤害自己
No man could have protected him from himself.

巴利斯坦爵士 我倒是很好奇 这酒是谁拿给国王的? 
I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?

他的侍从 拿的是国王自己的酒袋
His squire, from the king's own skin.

他的侍从? 那兰尼斯特小子? 
His squire? The Lannister boy?

真是个忠于职守的好孩子 陛下他永远都不愁没得喝哟
Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.

真希望这可怜的孩子别太自责
I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.

关于丹妮莉丝·坦格利安那件事 劳勃已经回心转意
His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

无论你安排了什么...  我要你立刻收回成命
Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once.

恐怕 鸟儿已经飞上了天
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

这女孩已经死了哪
The girl is likely dead already.

骑着世界的骏马不需要铁椅子
The stallion that mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.

预言所载 骏马将行至世界尽头
According to the prophecy the stallion will ride to the ends of the world.

世界的尽头是黑色咸海
The earth ends at The Black Salt Sea.

没有马可以穿越毒水
No horse can cross the poison water.

那里不是世界尽头
The Earth never ends.

在海的另一边 有一片广袤的泥土
There are many dirts across.

我出生的泥土
The dirts of my birth.

卓戈 卡奥
多斯拉克部族首领

自由贸易城邦有几千艘船
There are thousands of ships

它们就是能够横越海洋的木马
Wooden that fly across

我们不要再谈木马和铁椅子
Let's speak no more about wooden horses or iron chairs.

那不是椅子 是
It's not a chair. It's...it's...

那是卡奥的王座 或者是卡丽熙的
A chair for a king to sit upon...  or a queen.

卡奥不需要椅子
A khal doesn't need a chair to sit on.

他只需要一匹骏马
He only needs a steed.

你就不能帮助我让他了解吗? 
Can't you help me make him understand?

多斯拉克人行事自有其步调和理由
The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.

卡丽熙 请您耐心等待 我们会回家的 我向您保证
Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.

我哥... 是个傻瓜 我知道 可他毕竟是七大王国的合法继承人
My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

我说得不对吗 爵士先生? 
Have I said something funny, Ser?

请原谅 卡丽熙 但您的先祖... 吞并六国的'征服者'伊耿 他可不管什么合法不合法
Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.

他对维斯特洛没有任何权利 他靠的是武力
He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.

靠的是龙
And because he had dragons.

是啊 天上掉下几条龙事情就简单多了
Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.

你不相信有龙吗?  敢问您见过龙吗 卡丽熙? 
You don't believe it. Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

所谓眼见为实
I believe what my eyes and ears report.

三百年前的事
As for the rest... It was 300 years ago.

谁知道真相如何? 
Who knows what really happened?

请容我暂时告退 我要去找商队统领 看看有没有给我的信
Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me.

好啊 我帮你找 不 不 不必劳动您
I'll come with you. No no, don't trouble yourself.

尽情享受这市集吧 我快去快回
Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.

嗨 安答尔人乔拉
Psst, Jorah the Andal.

蜘蛛让我带来问候 和祝贺
The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.

你获得了王家赦免... 可以回家了
A royal pardonyou can go home now.

香甜的红酒啰
Sweet reds. I have it. I have it.

我有里斯 瓦兰提斯和青亭岛产的香甜红酒!
Sweet reds! I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor.

泰洛西产的梨子白兰地 安达尔酸酒!
Tyroshi pear brandy. Andhalish sours!

我通通都有! 通通都有啰!
I have them! I have them!

卡丽熙 您要不要尝一口? 
A taste for the khaleesi?

尊贵的夫人 我有多恩产的夏日红酒
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

您只需喝上一口 保证会用我的名字为孩子命名
One taste and you'll name your first child after me.

我儿子已经有名字了 不过我还是尝尝你的夏日红吧 一口就好
My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.Just a taste.

尊贵的夫人 您是维斯特洛人吗? 
My Lady, you are from Westeros.

你有幸与马上民族的卡丽熙 七大王国的公主
You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen,

坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝说话
Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

我还想尝尝你的夏日红呢
I'd still like to taste that wine.

配不上公主您的
Not worthy of a princess.

我有一种青亭岛产的干红 堪称诸神的花蜜
I have a dry red from the Arbor nectar of the Gods.

让我送您一桶罢 作为礼物!
Let me give you a cask. Uha gift.

这... 这应该说是我的荣幸
The honorthe honor is all mine.

公主殿下您知道吗? 在您的故国 子民们日夜祈祷您的归来呢
There are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.

我希望将来能回报你的好意
I hope to repay your kindness someday.

拉卡洛 把酒放下
Rakharo.  put down that cask.

有什么不对吗?  我口正渴
Is something wrong? I have a thirst.

酒是要送给卡丽熙 不是给你这种人喝的
The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.

这么好的酒 不让它先透透气就喝 简直是滔天大罪啊
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.

谨遵公主殿下吩咐
As the princess commands.

爵士先生 您可闻出了葡萄的香气? 
Can you smell the fruit, Ser?

然后告诉我 这是不是您喝过的最甘甜的酒
Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.

我不够格喝这么好的酒
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

何况哪有酒贩子 喝自己的酒呢? 
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.

你们来时为法律所不容 盗猎 强奸 杀人 偷窃
You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.

你们来时孑然一身 身负枷锁 既无友朋 更无荣誉
You came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor.

你们来时或富贵荣禄 或赤贫如洗
You came to us rich and you came to us poor.

你们来自豪门望族 或仅有私生子之名 甚或籍籍无名
Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.

一切已成过去
All that is in the past.

在这里 长城之上 我们都是一家人
Here, on the wall, are all one house.

今晚... 开心点儿
Tonight... You're allowed to look happy.

你就快当上游骑兵了
You're going to be a Ranger.

你不老想着这个么? 
Isn't that what you always wanted?

我只想找到我叔叔
I want to find my Uncle.

我知道他还活着
I know he's alive out there.

我倒是想帮你 可惜我不是游骑兵
I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.

我注定只能作事务官
It's the steward's life for me.

当事务官也是种荣誉
There's honor in being a steward.

守夜人的汉子
A man of The Night's Watch...

为王国效命
Lives his life for the realm.

非为国王 非为贵族 亦非为豪门荣辱 不论财富 不论光荣 亦不论儿女情爱 一切只为王国安泰 及其子民平安
Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house; not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love; but for the realm and all the people in it.

你们都听过了誓言内容
You've all learned the words of the vow.

在发誓以前请仔细考虑
Think carefully before you say them.

背离职守 将只有死刑
The penalty for desertion is death.

你们可以在此发誓 等到今夜 日落时分
You can take your vows here tonight at sunset.

你们中还有信仰旧神的吗? 
Do any of you still keep the old Gods?

你情愿跟你叔叔一样 在心树之下宣誓? 
You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.

你会在长城以北一里处找到一片鱼梁木
You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall.

或许也会找到你的旧神
And your old Gods too, maybe.

大人? 我能不能跟他一起去? 
My Lord, might I go as well?

塔利家族莫非信奉旧神? 
Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?

我的命名仪式乃是在七神的荣光照耀下举行 我父亲如此 他的父亲亦如此
I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.

那你为何要抛弃令尊和你家族长久以来信仰的诸神呢? 
Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?

如今我以守夜人军团为家
The Night's Watch is my house now.

七神从未回应我的祈祷
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

或许旧神会呢
Perhaps the old Gods will.

依照我们的需求 以及你们自身的能力 你们将被分配到不同的职业
You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.

记得别取笑他的鼻子
Make no comment about his nose.

琼恩·雪诺 莫尔蒙司令 要你当他的私人事务官
Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.

我是不是要帮总司令打理三餐?  为他打热水洗澡? 
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.

你还要为他房间生火 每天为他换洗床单和毛毯 以及承担总司令要你做的任何其他事情
And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.

你当我是下人么? 
Do you take me for a servant?

我们当你是守夜人的汉子
We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.

不过或许我们错看了你
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

我可以走了吗?  去吧
May I go? As you wish.

你看不出他们的用意吗? 
Don't you see what they're doing?

我只看出这是艾里沙爵士的报复
I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

他想羞辱我 这下得遂心愿了
He wanted it and he got it.

事物官和女仆没两样!
Stewards are nothing but maids!

不论使剑 骑马我都比你们行!
I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!

我以前为橡果厅的领主唱歌时 他把手伸到我两腿之间 说要瞧瞧我的命根子
I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.

我把他推开 他竟然宣布 要以偷窃罪砍我的手
I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

我就这样被发配到了这里 到了世界的尽头 从此只能给老头子 和你们这样的小杂毛唱歌
So now I'm hereat the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you.

再不能跟家人见面
I'll never see my family again.

再不能跟女人亲热
I'll never be inside a woman again.

别告诉我什么叫公平
So don't tell me about fair.

我还以为你是为挨饿的老妹 偷了一轮奶酪才被抓的
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?

谁会随便跟一群陌生人吐露 一个高高在上的陛下看上了他的命根子? 
You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

能唱首歌吗 派普? 我想听歌
Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.

你要伺候的老头可是堂堂守夜人军团总司令
The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.

而你会日夜跟他相处
You'll be with him day and night.

没错 你是得帮他洗衣服
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

但你也会替他送信 随他参加会议 打仗的时候当他的侍从
But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.

大小事务你都会知情 甚至能施加影响
You'll know everything, be part of everything.

更何况是他指定要你的...
And he asked for you himself.

他是想训练你作接班人哪
He wants to groom you for command.

我一直想当个游骑兵
I always wanted to be a Ranger.

我还一直想当魔法师呢
I always wanted to be a Wizard.

你会留下来跟我一起宣誓? 
So you'll stay and say your words with me?

艾德大人 借一步说话? 
Lord Stark, a moment.

他任命您为全境守护者? 
He named you Protector of the Realm.

给我一个钟头 我能给您一百人
Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.

请问我要这一百人做什么呢? 
And what should I do with a hundred swords?

先发制人! 趁今晚大家还在熟睡时
Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.

我们得把乔佛里从他母亲手里夺过来当筹码
We must get Joffrey away fro his mother and into our custody.

是不是守护者无关紧要 挟有国王才能号令全国
Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.

而您每耽搁一秒 就是多给瑟曦一秒准备的时间
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.

等劳勃一死 只怕对你我两人都为时已晚
By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.

莫非您打算把七国从瑟曦魔掌下拯救出来 又拱手交给史坦尼斯? 
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?

您对'守护王国'的理解可真奇特
You have odd notions about protecting the realm.

史坦尼斯可是你的兄长
Stannis is your older brother.

我们所谈论的事与血统继承无关
This isn't about the bloody line of succession.

当年你们起兵推翻疯王 何曾考虑过继承权? 
That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King.

你现在又何苦斤斤计较? 
It shouldn't matter now.

怎样做对国家最有利? 
What's best for the Kingdoms?

怎样做才对得起老百姓? 
What's best for the people we rule?

我们都清楚史坦尼斯是什么德行
We all know what Stannis is.

没人爱戴他 也不会有人真正追随他
He inspires no love or loyalty.

史坦尼斯是一位优秀的指挥官
Stannis is a commander.

他两度担任大军统帅
He's led men into war twice.

他摧毁过葛雷乔伊的舰队...
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet

没错 每个人都知道 他很会打仗...
Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that.

你还相信会打仗等于能治国吗? 
Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?

我不会在劳勃生命的最后时刻 在朝堂里杀人流血 犯下把惊慌失措的孩子从睡梦中强行拉走的罪行
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.

今晚你就坐船去龙石船
You will sail to dragonstone tonight.

把这封信当面交给史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩大人
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.

记住 不管是他的总管 侍卫队长 或他的夫人都不行
Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife.

一定要交给史坦尼斯本人
Only Stannis himself.

国王没有亲生儿子
The King has no trueborn sons.

乔佛里和托曼 是詹姆·兰尼斯特的私生子
Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

所以国王死后... 王位应传给他二弟
So when the King diesThe throne passes to his brother

除非... 没有'除非'!
Unlessthere is no 'unless.'

史坦尼斯是合法继承人 没有什么可以改变事实
He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.

但缺了你的协助 他得不到王位
And he cannot take the throne without your help.

如果你够聪明 就应该忽略他 确保乔佛里登基为王
You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

你一点荣誉心都没有吗? 
Do you have a shred of honor?

你既是首相 又是全境守护者
You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.

大权在握 只需伸手...  便可夺取天下
All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it.

与兰尼斯特家和好
Make peace with the Lannisters.

释放小恶魔 把你女儿嫁给乔佛里
Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

我们有足够的时间解决掉史坦尼斯
We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis.

若是乔佛里登上王位后 惹人厌 我们只需揭穿他的小秘密 再把蓝礼大人送上台...
And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.

您总需要别人来帮您分担重责大任罢
You'll need someone to share these burdens.

我跟您保证 我的价码绝对公道
I assure youmy price would be modest.

你建议的可是叛国大罪
What you suggest is treason.

你要我跟兰尼斯特家讲和...
Make peace with the Lannisters, you say...

他们派人杀我儿子
With the people who tried to murder my boy.

大人 只有和敌人才谈得上'讲和'二字
We only make peace with our enemies, My Lord.

您懂吗? 
That's why it's called 'making peace.'

所以就是史坦尼斯和战争? 
So it will be Stannis and war?

我别无选择
There is no other choice.

那您找我有何贵干? 
So why did you call me here?

既然不为了我的智慧
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

你答应过凯特琳会帮忙
You promised Catelyn you would help me.

王后身边有十来位骑士和上百名侍卫 足够对付我留在身边的护卫
The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.

我需要金袍子
I need the gold cloaks.

都城守卫队一共有两千人 他们宣誓以国王之名维护和平
The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.

你知道要请我做什么 更明白这件事势在必行 可它一点也不名誉 所以话哽在你喉咙里说不出来
You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.

当王后立了一个国王 首相却立了另一个 请问金袍子要以谁之名维护和平哩? 
When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?

付钱的人
The man who pays them.

倾听我的誓言 做我的见证
Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.

长夜将至 我从今开始守望
Night gathers and now my watch begins.

至死方休
It shall not end until my death.

我将不娶妻 不封地 不生子
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

我将不戴宝冠 不争荣宠
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.

我将尽忠职守 生死于斯
I shall live and die at my post.

我是黑暗中的利剑
I am the sword in the darkness.

长城上的守卫
I am the watcher on the walls.

守护王国的坚盾
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人 今夜如此 夜夜皆然
I pledge my li and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.

起来吧 守夜人的汉子
Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.

恭喜 恭喜
Well done. Well done.

白灵 来我这儿 把东西带过来
To me, ghost. Bring it here.

他们会怎么处置他? 
What will they do to him?

当卡拉萨开拔时 他会被栓在马后面 跟着马群无休止的奔跑
When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.

我见过的人最多坚持九里
I saw a man last nine miles once.

劳勃国王还在追杀我
King Robert still wants me dead.

这个下毒的是第一个 但绝不会是最后一个
This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.

我以为我哥哥死了 他就会放过我
I thought he'd leave me alone now that my brother is gone.

他永远也不会放过你
He will never leave you alone.

哪怕你逃到阴影笼罩的亚夏 他的刺客也会尾随而至
If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.

即便你远航至蛇蜥群岛 他的探子也会查出你的去向
If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him.

他不会半途而废
He will never abandon the hunt.

因为你是坦格利安家的人 最后的坦格利安
You're a Targaryenthe last Targaryen.

你的儿子有真龙血脉 还有四万骑马战士的拥护
Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him.

他绝不能伤到我儿子
He will not have my son.

他也绝不能伤到你 卡丽熙
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

我听说了你的作为 任意挑选一匹马 它是你的了

I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

天亮前一个小时 他自旧城门离开 随行的有洛拉斯·提利尔爵士和五十名随从
He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.

据最新情报 他们正快马加鞭往南赶

这是劳勃国王的印信 未经拆封

'Lord Eddard Stark is herein named

为摄政王及全境守护者 代吾统理国事 俟吾之合法继承人成年为止
Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age.'

巴利斯坦爵士 我可以看看吗? 
May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

全境守护者
Protector of the realm.

史塔克大人 你想拿这当挡箭牌吗? 
Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

那是国王的遗嘱啊 我们有了新国王
Those were the King's words. We have a new King now.

艾德大人 上次见面 你给了我一些建议
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.

现在也让我回个礼
Allow me to return the courtesy.

跪下 大人
Bend the knee, My Lord.

只要您跪下宣誓效忠我儿子 我们就准许你回到那片你称之为家的灰色荒原 安享晚年
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.

你儿子无权继承王位
Your son has no claim to the throne.

史塔克大人 你这是自寻死路
You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

巴利斯坦爵士 拿下这个叛徒
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

巴利斯坦爵士是位正直忠诚的人 别伤害他
Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.

你以为巴利斯坦爵士孤军奋战吗?

杀了他! 把他们通通杀掉! 我命令你们!
Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!

司令!  请您暂时拘捕王后和她的孩子
Commander, take the Queen and her children into custody.

将他们送回王家居室 并派人加以看守
Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.

叫你的手下放下武器

我不是警告你别信任我的嘛
I did warn you not to trust me.

呀! 左上! 左下!
Yah! Left high, left low.

右下! 右突刺!
Right low, lunge right.

你打碎一件东西 修女就会要我的脑袋
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.

你妹妹明明知道我们今天要走
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.

她怎么能忘了 她没忘
How she could forget She didn't forget.

她和她的舞蹈老师在一起 每个早上都是这样
She's with her dancing master. She's with him every morning.

然后带着擦伤和淤青回来 她总是这么鲁莽
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.

快回房间

把门堵上 别为任何陌生人开门

怎么了? 发生了什么?  按我说的做
What is it? What's happening? Do as I told you.

你说的是右 但却往左刺
You said right, but you went left.

没错 然后你就是个死女孩了
And now you are a dead girl.

只是因为你骗人
Only 'cause you lied.

我的舌头说了谎 但我的眼睛 说的却是事实 可你视而不见
My tongue lied. My eyes shouted the truth.You were not seeing.

我有 我看了 但你…
I was so. I watched, but you

死掉的丫头 观看并不代表洞察
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

洞察 真正的洞察 才是剑术的灵魂
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.

艾丽娅・史塔克 跟我们来
Arya Stark, come with us.

你父亲要见你
Your father wants to see you.

我很好奇 为什么艾德不派自己的人 却派来了几个兰尼斯特的人? 
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.

舞蹈老师 别不识好歹
Mind your place, dancing master.

此事跟你毫无干系
This is no concern of yours.

你们不是我父亲派来的
My father wouldn't send you.

而且只要我不乐意 就不会跟你们走
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.

竟然威胁一个孩子 你们是人还是禽兽? 
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?

滚开 小个子
Get out of my way, little man.

…你们跟我说话的时候要更有礼貌
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.

干掉这个布拉佛斯人 抓住那丫头
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

小艾丽娅 今天的舞蹈课就到此为止
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.

布拉佛斯的首席剑士从不临阵脱逃
The First Sword of Braavos does not run.

我们是 怎么回答死神的? 
What do we say to the God of Death?

时候未到 时候未到
Not today. Not today.

我要…我要告诉王后
I'llI'll tell the Queen.

你以为是谁派我来的? 
Who do you think sent me?

你要干什么?  我要你 小狼女
What do you want? I want you, wolf girl.

过来 别过来!
Come here. Leave me be.

我的父亲是公爵 他会重赏你的
My father's a lord. He'll reward you.

王后那儿才真有重赏
She'll reward methe Queen!

史塔克大人 你一定很渴
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

我向你保证这不是毒酒
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

为什么就没人相信一次太监呢? 
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

大人 别一次喝这么多
Not so much, My Lord.

如果我是你 就会把剩下的好好保存起来
I would save the rest, if I were you.

藏起来吧 这些牢里可是渴死过人的
Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.

我女儿们怎样了? 
What about my daughters?

小的那个似乎逃出了城堡
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.

连我的小小鸟都不知道她的踪迹
Even my little birds cannot find her.

珊莎呢?  她还是乔佛里的未婚妻
And Sansa? Still engaged to Joffrey.

瑟曦把她留在了身边 而您那些手下 都死掉啦 说起来真难过啊
Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though all dead, it grieves me to say.

我真讨厌看见血
I do so hate the sight of blood.

我的人被屠杀 而你只是袖手旁观
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.

再来一次我依然会那么做 大人
And would again, My Lord.

我手无寸铁 身无片甲 又被兰尼斯特的精兵环绕
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.

我看起来很像英雄吗? 
When you look at me do you see a hero?

你是发了什么疯才会告诉王后 你知道乔佛里身世的真相? 
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?

仁慈的疯狂
The madness of mercy.

让她有机会拯救她的孩子们
That she might save her children.

总是无辜的人受罪
It is always the innocents who suffer.

杀死劳勃的并不是酒 也不是野猪
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.

美酒只是让他行动缓慢 野猪不过将他身体撕裂 真正杀死国王的 乃是你所谓的仁慈
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.

我想你已经知道自己难逃一死了吧 艾德大人? 
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?

王后不能杀我
The Queen can't kill me.

她的兄弟还在凯特手上
Cat holds her brother.

真可惜 此兄弟非彼兄弟
The wrong brother sadly.

你的妻子让小恶魔从手指缝里溜走了
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.

果真如此的话 帮我做个了结 割了我的喉咙
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.

告诉我 瓦里斯
Tell me something, Varys.

你效忠的究竟是谁
Who do you truly serve?

这是奥瑟 错不了
It's Othor, without a doubt.

另一个是杰佛・佛花 大人 少了一只手 被狼叼走的那只
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.

有班扬或者他手下其他人的踪迹么
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?

就这两个 大人
Just these two, My Lord.

我得说 他们死了有一会儿了
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

如果他们已经死了很长时间了 尸体为什么不腐烂? 
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?

雪诺说的不错 大人 应该火化
Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them.

我想先让伊蒙师傅检查一下
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.

塔利 你可能是个懦夫 不过绝对不蠢
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.

抬进去 快照办
Get them inside. You heard him.

伊蒙师傅在他的房间里等你
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers

有来自君临的乌鸦
A raven from King's Landing.

快 抬出去
Come on, move 'em out.

给我来一杯麦芽酒 雪诺 给你自己也来一杯
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.

有我父亲的消息吗? 
Is there any word of my father?

史塔克现在 被控犯下叛国罪行
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.

他们说他跟劳勃的兄弟们密谋 篡夺乔佛里王子的王位
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

我希望你不要想着去做什么傻事
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.

因为现在你的职责在这里
Your duty lies here now.

我的妹妹们也在君临
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

我确定 他们会礼待你的妹妹们
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.

亲爱的 你父亲犯下了可耻的叛国罪行
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.

劳勃国王尸骨未寒 他就在密谋夺取乔佛里的王位
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

他知道我有多爱乔佛里 他不会的
He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

求求你了 陛下 这一定是个误会
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.

传召我的父亲啊 他会告诉你…国王是他的朋友啊
Send for my father. He'll tell youthe King was his friend.

亲爱的珊莎 你是无辜的 我们知道
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that.

但你是叛国者的女儿
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

我怎能再让你嫁给我的儿子? 
How can I allow you to marry my son?

你是叛国者的种 不适合做国王的配偶
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.

陛下 她现在还是个小甜心 但是又有谁知道十年之后 她会犯下怎样的罪行? 
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?

不 我不会的 我会是他的好妻子 你们会看到的
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.

我保证会像您那样做个好王后的 我不会干任何坏事的
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything.

陛下 这女孩是无辜的
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

应该给她一个机会去让她证明忠心
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.

小鸽子 你必须给凯特琳夫人写封信 还有你的长兄 他叫什么? 
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?

毫无疑问 他很快就会得知你父亲被捕的消息
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.

那么最好由你来告诉他
Best it comes from you.

如果你想帮你的父亲 就力劝你哥哥不要轻举妄动
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.

让他到君临来 向乔佛里宣誓效忠
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

如果…如果我能见到我父亲 告诉他…
Ifif I could see my father, talk to him about

孩子 你太让我失望了
You disappoint me, child.

我们已经告诉了你 他的叛国罪行
We have told you of your father's treason.

为什么你还想见一个叛国者呢? 
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?

你们要如何处置他? 
What will happen to him?

看情况 看…看什么情况? 
That depends. Onon what?

是你妹妹写的 但明显出于王后的授意
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.

他们召唤你去君临向新国王宣誓效忠
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.

乔佛里囚禁了我父亲 现在还要我去亲他的屁股? 
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?

这是王家御旨 大人
This is a royal command, My Lord.

如果你要拒绝 我不会拒绝
If you should refuse to obey I won't refuse.

既然陛下召我去君临
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,

我就照他说的做
I'll go to King's Landing.

全部的封臣 大人? 
All of them, My Lord?

他们全都曾宣誓守护我父亲 不是么? 
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?

那么现在我们就看看他们的誓言价值几何
Now we see what their words are worth.

这说明你并不蠢
It means you're not stupid.

你早上就得到了这封信? 
You've had this since dawn?

他送给我的 不是你
He sent it to me, not you.

我给你这个只是出于礼貌
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.

我丈夫被囚禁
My husband has been taken prisoner.

我儿子准备开战
My son intends to declare war.

你儿子向兰尼斯特? 
Your son against the Lannisters?

你该回到他身边 教教他什么是耐心
You should go to him. Teach him patience.

奈德正遭受牢狱之苦 而你却和我谈耐心? 
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?

他是你的姐夫啊!
He is your brother by law!

难道家人对你来说什么都不是么? 
Does family mean nothing to you?

家人对我来说意味着一切
Family means everything to me.

所以为了罗宾的安危 我绝不会冒险参与你丈夫的又一次战争
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.

我饿了 安静 宝贝儿
I'm hungry. Hush now, darling.

所以你不会支持我们了是吗? 我理解得没错吧? 
You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?

但我饿了! 马上 亲爱的 马上
But I'm hungry! Soon, love, soon.

这里一直都欢迎你 姐姐
You're always welcome here, sister.

但你如果想要我把子民从谷地拉进战场
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight

去吧 甜心 该洗澡了
Go on, sweet. Time for your bath.

如果你为你儿子的安全担心
If you fear for the safety of your son

我当然担心我儿子的安全!
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!

他们杀了我丈夫
They killed my husband.

你还说他们把你的儿子从窗口扔了下去
You say they shoved your boy from a window.

这些人什么都做得出来
These people will do anything.

正因如此 我们才要阻止他们
And that is why we have to stop them.

艾林谷的骑士将呆在他们的艾林谷 保护他们的封君
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.

这里到处都有高山部落
There's hill tribes all around here.

如果我要死了 我心里仍旧会唱这么一首
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.

我会拿走你的食物然后把你撂下
I should just take your food and leave you here.

恩? 那你接下来会怎么做? 
Eh? What would you do then?

你不认为我会这么干 是吗? 
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

你想要什么 波隆? 金子? 女人? 
What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women?

跟着我 你会得到这些的 我活着你就荣华富贵 死了你就万事皆休
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.

这就是你勇敢地拿起武器保护我的原因
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.

但别叫我来卑躬屈膝 每次你拉个屎都要满口'老爷大人'
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and 'My Lord' you every time you take a shit.

我懒得拍你马屁 你也别当我是朋友
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.

尽管如此 我仍会把你的友情视为珍宝
Though I would treasure your friendship,

我主要是对你杀人的本领感兴趣
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.

还有 要是哪天有人引诱你出卖我 请你记住
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:

不管对方出价多少 我都出得比他更高
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.

来啊 诸位 一起烤烤火
Come, share our fire.

欢迎各位前来品尝羊肉
Help yourselves to our goat.

当你升天见到你的神后 告诉他们
When you meet your Gods, you tell them

送你上天的 是石鸦部的多夫之子夏嘎
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.

我是兰尼斯特部的泰温之子提利昂
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.

你想怎么个死法? 泰温之子提利昂
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?

我想活到八十岁 喝饱一肚子酒 找个姑娘含着我的鸡巴 这才死在自己的暖床上
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.

我们可以让他跳舞逗孩子开心 杀了另外一个家伙
He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.

我…我的家族既有钱又有势
Mymy House is rich and powerful.

只要你们能保护我们平安出山 我老爸赏你们的金子会多到可以拿来洗澡
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.

半人的承诺对我们来说没用
We have no use for a half man's promises.

我也许只是半个人 但至少我有勇气面对敌人
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.

石鸦部呢? 
What do the Stone Crows do?

等峡谷骑士来了 你们还不是只敢躲在石头后面 害怕得发抖? 
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?

你偷到的最好的货色就这样? 
Are those the best weapons you could steal?

杀羊或许可以 只要那羊乖乖认命让你们杀
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.

兰尼斯特的铁匠拉出的屎都比这高级
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

你认为用你们的小玩意儿就能争取到我们? 
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?

那个小玩意儿比你部族里的任何东西都更值钱
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.

而如果你帮助我 多夫之子夏嘎
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,

我给你的远不止这些
I will not give you trinkets.

我会给你这个
I will give you this.

峡谷公爵总是在侮辱山脉氏族
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.

峡谷公爵也想让我死
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.

我认为是时候让谷地换个新老爷了
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.

看啊 这儿有个稀罕货 不仅是个杂种 还是叛徒的杂种
Now there's a rare sight not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.

琼恩 不要! 琼恩 住手 放下武器!
Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!

血统说明了一切
Blood will always tell.

你会为此付出代价的 杂种
You'll hang for this, bastard.

我告诉过你别做傻事
I told you not to do anything stupid.

你被关禁闭了 去吧
You're confined to quarters. Go.

外面有什么东西吗? 
Is something out there?

羊人会是很好的奴隶
Lamb men make good salves.

卓戈卡奥会将他们作为礼物赠予奴隶主 而奴隶主会回赠我们金子 以及丝绸和钢铁
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk and steel.

我以为多斯拉克人并不信任金钱
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.

金子可以雇船 公主殿下 去维斯特洛的船
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.

乔拉 叫他们住手
Jorah, make them stop.

卡丽熙?  你听到了我在说什么
Khaleesi? You heard me.

那些人为了卡奥流血卖命 如今他们有权取得应有的奖赏
These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards.

她只不过是个羊女 卡丽熙
She's a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

能被战士们骑 是她的荣誉
The riders do her honor.

如果她的喊叫声吵到了卡丽熙
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,

我可以为您割下她的舌头
I will bring you her tongue.

公主殿下 您心怀仁慈 但这是他们的传统
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.

我想我并不仁慈 爵士
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.

照我说的做 否则卓戈卡奥唯你们是问
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

你打算怎么处置她们
What do you want done with them?

把她带到我这来 把那些女人带去那边吧
Bring her to me. And those women there.

你没法把她们统统收归己有 公主
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

卡丽熙必须把我的战利品还回来 否则我就亲自用弯刀抢回来
Khaleesi will give me my prize or I will take it with my arakh.

她会过来告诉我发生了什么 在此之前你都给我闭上嘴
She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quite.

马戈说你夺走了他的战利品 一个应该让他骑的羊人之女
Mago says you have taken his spoils, a daughter of the lamb man who was his to mount.

告诉我实话
Tell me the truth of this.

马戈说的没错 我的日和星
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.

卓戈 卡奥
多斯拉克部族首领

我今天认养了许多女儿 所以任何人都不许骑她们
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.

这是战争之道
This is the way of war.

眼下这些女人都是奴隶 随我们高兴而处置
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.

那我高兴让她们平安
It pleases me to keep them safe.

若你的战士们想骑她们 就先把她们收做妻子
If your riders would mount them, let them take them as wives.

马怎么能和羊配对? 
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

对龙而言马和羊一样是食物
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

你不能命令我
You do not command me.

我是卡丽熙 当然能命令你
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.

看到她变得多凶猛了吗? 
See how fierce she grows?

这都是因为我的儿子 骑着世界的骏马 在她体内 让她充满火焰
That's my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.

马戈 去找别的羊女骑
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.

一个听命于外人的卡奥就不算是卡奥了
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.

我不会让他们烧掉你的尸体
I will not have you body burned.

我不会给你那个荣誉
I will not give you that honor.

甲虫会吞吃你的眼睛
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

蠕虫将在你的肺里爬行
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

雨水会打落在你腐烂的皮肤上 直到只剩骸骨残余
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.

但你得先杀得了我
First you have to kill me.

我的日和星受伤了
My sun and stars is hurt.

擦伤而已 我生命中的月亮
A scratch, moon of my life.

医者在哪儿? 
Where are the healers.

不过是被苍蝇叮了一口
This is the bite of a fly.

我可以为伟大的骑马战士处理伤口
I can help the great rider with his cut.

卡奥不需要跟羊交配的奴隶来帮忙
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.

她是我的人 让她说下去
She's mine. Let her speak.

谢谢你 银夫人
Thank you, silver lady.

我名为弥丽・马兹・笃尔 是这座神庙的女祭司
I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the godswife of this temple.

我的母亲也曾是这里的女祭司
My mother was godswife here before me.

她教我如何调制圣烟和圣膏
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.

在牧神治下 万物皆是平等 这是我们的信仰
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.

至高牧神派我下凡医治他的…
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his

她说的太多了 听她说话会毒坏耳朵
Too many words. The witch's words poison the ears.

羊羔还是狮子 他的伤口需要清洗包扎 否则会溃烂
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.

让她清理你的伤口吧 我的日和星
Let her clean your wound my sun and stars.

看到你受伤 我也很痛苦
It makes me hurt to see you bleed.

我在死人堆里打滚已经三十多年了 小子
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.

我才是为你统帅先锋的最佳人选
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.

我将任命盖伯特・葛洛佛来统帅先锋
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

要想安柏家的人跟在葛洛佛后面 除非那该死的长城融掉
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.

我要统领先锋 否则我就立刻带着我的人 班师回家
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.

欢迎您这么做 安柏伯爵
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.

等收拾掉兰尼斯特之后
And when I am done with the Lannisters

我们会立刻回师北方 把你从你家的城堡里抓出来 当成背誓者吊死
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.

别以为我会坐在这里任你侮辱 你这撒尿都是草绿色的小鬼
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.

我父亲大人曾经教导我 在宣誓效忠的封君面前拔剑 乃是死罪
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.

但也许大琼恩只是想为我切肉罢了
But doubtless the Great jon only meant to cut my meat for me.

你的肉 还真他妈的硬
Your meat is bloody tough.

怎么回事? 发生什么了?  嘘 没事
What is it? What's happened? Shh, it's all right.

你要去哪儿?  去南方 为了救父亲
Where are you going? South. For father.

但现在是午夜啊
But it's the middle of the night.

兰尼斯特的探子无处不在
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

我不想让他们知道我们的动向
I don't want them to know we're coming.

他们比我们人多
They have more men than we do.

我不能跟你一起去吗? 
Can't I come with you?

我现在可以骑马了 你看过我骑马的样子
I can ride now. You've seen me riding.

而且我绝不会给你添麻烦 我…
And I won't get in the way, I

临冬城中不能没有史塔克
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.

在我回来以前 那便是你的责任
Until I return that will be you.

我们离开的这段时间里 你不能踏出城墙半步 听懂了吗? 
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand?

听从鲁温师傅的意见 照顾好你的小弟弟
Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.

只要有机会我就写信 但如果你失去了我的消息 也不要害怕
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.

你在那儿藏了多久了? 
How long have you been hiding out there?

罗柏肯定在四处找你道别呢
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.

他们全都走了
They've all gone away.

他们很快就会回家 罗柏会救出父亲 然后他们会和母亲一起回家
They'll be back soon. Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.

拜托 请照看罗柏
Please watch over Robb.

以及临冬城的所有人
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.

席恩也算吧 我想
And Theon too, I suppose.

旧神正在回答你呢
The Old Gods are answering you.

你在这里做什么? 
What are you doing here?

在长城之外 他们是唯一的真神
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.

即便是奴隶也有资格祈祷
Even slaves are allowed to pray.

呃 这要怪你朋友当时用匕首抵着我的喉咙
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.

我这不是发牢骚 小主人 只是在陈述事实
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.

你刚才说能听到旧神说话 那是什么意思? 
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?

你向他们祈求 而他们正在回答
You asked them, they're answering you.

你以为这风是谁送来的啊?  当然是天上诸神啊
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?

你哥哥要去的地方 他们无法帮他
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.

旧神在南方没有力量
The Old Gods have no power in the South.

那儿的鱼梁木早在很多年前就被砍伐一空
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.

没有眼睛 他们该如何去看呢? 
How can they watch when they have no eyes?

啊 他可真是个大块头
Well, there's a big man.

他要是没有巨人血统 我肯定就是女王了
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.

阿多 回去穿上衣服
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

长城之外真的有巨人吗? 
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?

巨人 以及比巨人更可怕的东西
Giants and worse than giants.

我试过告诉你哥哥 他走错了方向
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.

他的军队应该去北方的 小子
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.

冷风已然吹起
The cold winds are rising.

他们被异鬼触碰过
They were touched by White Walkers.

所以才能返回长城
That's why they came back.

所以变成了蓝眼睛
That's why their eyes turned blue.

唯有火焰能够阻挡他们
Only fire will stop them.

你怎么知道这些的? 
How do you know that?

我从一本书中读到的 伊蒙师傅藏书室中的一本非常非常古老的书
I read about it in a book a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.

那书里还说了什么? 
What else did the book say?

异鬼 在寒冰之下沉睡数千年
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.

等他们醒来后
And when they wake up

等他们醒来后 就怎么了? 
And when they wake up, what?

我只希望绝境长城足够高
I hope the Wall is high enough.

夏雪啊 夫人
Summer snows, My Lady.

罗柏将整个北境都带来了
Robb's brought the North with him.

河间地的领主正在 詹姆・兰尼斯特的追击之下节节败退
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

而泰温公爵正带着另一支兰尼斯特军队从南方杀来
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the south.

我们的斥候确定 那支军队比弑君者麾下的还要庞大
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

管他是一支军队还是两支 古代的北境之王 曾击退过十倍于此的强敌
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.

凯特林夫人 在这个动乱时刻 见到您真是令人宽心
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.

夫人 没想到会在这里见到您
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.

我也没想到会来这里
I had not thought to be here.

我希望能和儿子单独谈谈
I would speak with my son alone.

相信诸位大人必会谅解
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.

你们听到她说的了! 快走!
You heard her! Move your asses!

还有你 葛雷乔伊 你他妈聋了吗? 
You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?

别害怕 夫人
Have no fear, My Lady.

咱们过不了多久就会把剑捅进泰温・兰尼斯特的屁眼 然后一路杀进红堡 把奈德救出来
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.

你这老混蛋 罗德利克 琼恩
You old devil, Rodrik. Jon.

你怎么变瘦了? 
You're not wasting away, are you?

我仍然记得你来到世上的那天 红着脸 呱呱坠地
I remember the day you came into this world redfaced and squalling.

如今却发觉你正率领部下投入战场
And now I find you leading a host to war.

除了我没别人了 没别人? 
There was no one else. No one?

我刚刚见到的那些人是谁? 
Who were those men I saw here?

他们都不是史塔克 可他们全都阅历丰富 身经百战
None of them are Starks. All of them are seasoned in battle.

如果你认为能把我送回临冬城
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell

噢 我的确该那么做
Oh, would that I could.

这里… 有封信
There was...  a letter.

你是指'王后写的'吧
From the Queen, you mean.

这里面没有提到艾莉亚 没有
There's no mention of Arya. No.

你带来了多少人? 
How many men do you have?

如果我前往君临 然后对乔佛里宣誓效忠
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey

便永远不可能脱身 不能去
You would never be allowed to leave. No.

我们最大的希望 或者说唯一的希望 便是你能在战场上击败对手
Our best hopeour only hope is that you can defeat them in the field.

你知道疯王死后 坦格利安家 那些孩子们的下场吗?  他们在睡梦中惨遭杀害
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children when the Mad King fell? They were butchered in their sleep.

是泰温・兰尼斯特下的命令
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

虽然过了这么多年 他也绝对不会变得心慈手软
And the years have not made him kinder.

如果你失败了 你的父亲会死 你的妹妹们会死 我们 都会死
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.

这样一来倒是简单了许多
Well, that makes it simple then.

从这里开始 最好只让我和波隆两个人下去
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.

对泰温之子提利昂来说最好
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

如果半人胆敢耍我们
If the half man betrays us,

多夫之子夏嘎就要剁掉他的命根子…
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood

拿去喂山羊 我知道
And feed it to the goats, yes.

该去见我父亲了
Time to meet my father.

看来关于你已死的传言不攻自破了
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.

抱歉让您失望了
Sorry to disappoint you.

这些跟在你身边的… 贵客们 是些什么人? 
And who are these...  companions of yours?

这位是多夫之子夏嘎
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

石鸦部的酋长
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.

提魅之子提魅 灼人部的头领
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.

这位美少女是齐克之女齐拉 她是黑耳部的首领
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.

这位是波隆 他的父亲…
And here we have Bronn son of...

你不会认识他的
You wouldn't know him.

容我为各位介绍家父
May I present my lord father,

凯岩城公爵暨西境守护
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,

兰尼斯特家族的泰陀斯之子泰温
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?

感谢您为了我而开战
Kind of you to go to war for me.

事关家族荣誉
You left us no choice.

你让我别无选择
The honor of the House was at stake.

换成你哥哥 他绝不会如此轻易屈服于女人之手
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.

詹姆和我有很多不同
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

他更有勇气 我更加帅气
He's braver. I'm better looking.

他为自己争得满身的荣耀
He's been covering himself in glory.

詹姆在金牙城击溃了河间诸侯 现在已经包围了奔流城 凯特琳・史塔克的娘家
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.

史塔克家的人呢? 艾德大人呢? 
And the Starks? Lord Eddard?

他是我们的人质 在地牢里可无法统领军队
Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.

我的好姐姐究竟是怎么说服了劳勃国王 让他同意囚禁自己亲爱的好朋友奈德? 
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?

劳勃・拜拉席恩已经死了 如今在君临执政的是乔佛里
Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

你是说 我姐姐执政
My sister rules, you mean.

史塔克的儿子已经召集封臣
Stark's son has called his banners.

他正率领大军南下 一个毛头小子
He moves south with a strong host. A green boy.

一旦品尝过战争的滋味 就会夹着尾巴逃回临冬城
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

不过这小子生性好斗
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.

既然说到了打仗
While we're on the subject of war,

我曾对这几位朋友许下承诺 而且兰尼斯特有债必偿
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.

我们需要三千顶头盔和三千套锁甲 还有剑 长枪 颈甲 钉头锤
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces

启禀大人
If it please My Lord,

亚当爵士命我前来报告 北方人已经穿过了颈泽
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the Neck.

狼入狮口
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.

好极了 凯冯 吩咐鼓手敲集合令
So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.

并派人传话通知詹姆 我要即刻进军 与罗柏・史塔克决战
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.

据说高山部落的男子是勇猛无惧的战士
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.

与我一同出兵抗敌 我保证你们能得到我儿子承诺的一切 甚至更多
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.

那么半人必须跟我们在一起
Only if the half man fights with us.

在我们拿到他答应的武器之前 小狮子的命是我们的
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.

据斥候来报 泰温公爵已经挥师北进
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.

我们必须把他引到松软的地层上去 那样不利于兰尼斯特的骑兵作战
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.

不 我们要包围他 然后击破詹姆・兰尼斯特的包围圈
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

这样做 河间诸侯就会加入我们
Do that and the river lords will join us.

不论怎样做我们都必须过河 唯一的渡口在孪河城
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.

佛雷侯爵把守着渡口
Lord Frey controls that bridge.

他是你父亲的封臣
Your father's bannerman.

我父亲称他'迟到的佛雷侯爵'
'The late Lord Frey' my father calls him.

当年在三叉戟河 直到战争结束他才出现
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.

有些人对待誓言比别人严肃得多
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.

罗柏说得对 我们需要这座桥
Robb's right. We need that bridge.

那么接下来怎么做? 
So what's it going to be?

我们是攻击詹姆还是迎击泰温公爵? 
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?

恕我打扰 大人们
Your pardon, my lords.

我们抓住了一名兰尼斯特斥候
We've captured a Lannister scout.

别担心 小子 他不可能活着走出去
Don't worry, lad. He won't be leaving this tent with his head.

你们在哪里抓到他的? 
Where did you find him?

营地附近的灌木丛
In the brush above the encampment.

他好像在清点什么
He looked to be counting.

你数了多少? 
How high did you get?

你没必要亲自行刑
You don't have to do this yourself.

令尊大人会理解
Your father would understand

我父亲总是心怀仁慈 我们应当给他一个机会
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.

他还理解荣誉 以及勇气
And he understands honor...  and courage.

请知会泰温 凛冬已为他而至
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.

两万北方战士南下 来看他能不能拉出黄金屎
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.

你疯了吗 小子? 放他走? 
Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?

你敢再叫我一次小子
You call me boy again.

陛下有令 擢升尽忠职守的君临都城守备队队长
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

杰诺斯・史林特… 艾伦爵士
Commander of the City Watch... Ser Aron.

…为贵族行列…
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...

盖尔斯伯爵 并赐予其历史悠久的赫伦堡 其子嗣将世代承袭此等荣耀 万世不辍
Lord Gyles. And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.

为取代叛徒艾德・史塔克 遵照国王陛下的意愿
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,

由凯岩城公爵暨西境守护泰温・兰尼斯特 接任首相一职
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.

最后 值此密谋四起 动乱不堪的危殆之际 吾等御前会议之重臣认为 乔佛里国王 之生命安危 实乃首要之急
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.

陛下 微臣听候您的差遣
Your Grace, I am yours to command.

您可以卸下头盔
You may remove your helm.

长久以来您为国效命 尽忠职守
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.

七大王国中男女老少皆对您心怀感激
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

然而现在 恐怕您是时候解甲归田
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.

告老还乡 回顾您一生无数的荣耀
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.

陛下 御林铁卫乃宣誓效命的兄弟
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.

立下誓言 即为终身
Our vows are taken for life.

惟死方能解除我等神圣使命
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

巴利斯坦爵士 敢问是谁的死? 是你还是你的国王? 
Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?

你保护不了我父亲
You let my father die.

你年纪太大 谁都保护不了
You're too old to protect anybody.

陛下… 御前会议已经决定 由詹姆・兰尼斯特爵士接任你的职务 担任御林铁卫队长
Your GraceThe Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

就是那个以他誓言守护的国王 的鲜血来玷污自己宝剑的虚伪骑士么!
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!

对于您过去的贡献 我们非常感激 好爵士
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.

您被赐予海边一块肥沃的封地 以及足够满足您需要的仆人
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.

给我一个等死的地方 和为我送终的人
A hall to die in and men to bury me.

也要死得像个骑士
I shall die a knight.

显然 是个没穿衣服的骑士
A naked knight, apparently.

即便现在 我依旧可以像切乳酪一样把你们五个通通砍倒
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!

熔了这把剑 让王座上再多一把
Melt it down and add it to the others.

陛下倾听在场诸位的请愿 有事禀报 无事退朝
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.

小姐 请您上前来
Come forward, My Lady.

史塔克家族的珊莎小姐
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.

珊莎 你有事禀报国王陛下和御前会议? 
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?

陛下开恩 我要为家父
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,

亦即前首相艾德・史塔克公爵请愿
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.

叛国大罪好似带毒的野草
Treason is a noxious weed.

必须连根拔除 斩尽… 让她说吧
It should be torn out, rootLet her speak.

我要听听她的话
I want to hear what she says.

感谢您 陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

令尊所犯之罪行 你可否认? 
Do you deny your father's crime?

诸位大人 我不否认 我很清楚他必须接受制裁
No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.

家父必定已对其所作所为懊悔不已
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.

他是劳勃国王生前密友 敬他爱他
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.

在座各位都明白他对国王的一片真心
You all know he loved him.

国王开口之前 他甚至从未动过成为首相的念头
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.

他必定是被蓝礼公爵 史坦尼斯公爵 或某些人蛊惑的 他一定是被蛊惑的!
They must have lied to himLord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody. They must have lied!

他说我不是国王
He said I wasn't the King.

派席尔大学士给他服用了罂粟花奶
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.

让他神志不清 否则他是绝不会这样说的
He wasn't himself. Otherwise he never would have said it.

这是孩子对父亲的信心所致… 多么单纯而天真
A child's faith... Such sweet innocence.

可是人们不是常说 智慧往往来自孩子口中么
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.

如果您对我还有些许眷恋之心 就请以仁慈之心手下留情吧 陛下
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

你的一番肺腑之言感动了我
Your sweet words have moved me.

但你父亲必须俯首认罪
But your father has to confess.

他必须承认我是他的国王
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...

不然我无法宽恕他
Or there'll be no mercy for him.

您受苦了 大人
You've seen better days, My Lord.

看来你倒成了我仅剩的朋友
It seems you're my last friend.

哪里 很多人爱戴着您啊
No no, many still love you.

珊莎今天早上刚上朝 为您求情
Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.

为我下跪求饶是不是? 
On her knees, begging for me, hmmm.

你是不是跟别人一起看她的笑话? 
Did you laugh with the others?

您错怪我了 大人
You do me wrong, My Lord.

我对您的血一点兴趣都没有
Your blood is the last thing I want.

我不知道你感兴趣的是什么
I don't know what you want.

也不想再猜了
I've given up trying to guess.

我小时候 在他们用红热的匕首割我之前
When I was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife

曾跟戏班子在自由贸易城邦巡回演出
I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities.

他们教会我每个人都有自己该扮演的角色
They taught me that each man has a role to play.

朝廷里也是如此
The same is true at court.

我是情报总管
I am the master of whisperers.

当然应该诡计多端 擅长逢迎拍捧 行事无孔不入
My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples.

我演得不错吧 大人
I'm a good actor, My Lord.

你能把我从这地穴救出去吗? 
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

我说过 我不是英雄
As I said, I'm no hero.

告诉我 你究竟想要什么? 
What do you want? Tell me.

别再打哑谜 兜圈子了 你给我说清楚
No riddles, no storiestell me, what do you want?

您知不知道令公子带着北方大军南下了 这孩子一片孝心 为救父亲不顾一切
Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad fighting for his father's freedom.

自古英雄出少年哪
Boys have been conquerors before.

不过真正令瑟曦寝食难安的是国王...  已故国王的弟弟史坦尼斯大人
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the King'sthe late King's brother.

他的继承权名正言顺 本人又能征善战 而且绝不心软
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne, he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩是劳勃真正的继承人
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.

王位理应归他所有
The Throne is his by rights.

啧啧 珊莎那么努力地为您求情 若是不把握机会 实在太可惜了
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life, it would be a shame to throw it away.

她知道驯服的狼比死狼有用得多
She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.

你竟然要我为谋害我的国王 屠杀我的部下 还把我儿子摔成残废的女人效力? 
You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?

我要您为国家效力!
I want you to serve the realm!

对太后承诺您愿意坦白邪恶的叛国罪行 并命令您儿子放下武器 尊乔佛里为真正的国王
Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

瑟曦知道您是个言行一致的人
Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

只要您成全她 并保证死也不说出她的秘密
If you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

我相信她会同意您穿上黑衣 在长城和您弟弟 还有您那私生子一起渡过余生
I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.

你以为我的命珍贵到那种地步
You think my life is some precious thing to me?

值得让我用荣誉去换那区区几年...
That I would trade my honor for a few more years of...

你跟着戏班子长大
You grew up with actors.

你学会了演戏 而且演得很好
You learned their craft and you learned it well.

但我从小跟战士们为伍
But I grew up with soldiers.

早就知道如何面对死亡
I learned how to die a long time ago.

大人 您女儿的性命呢? 
What of your daughter's life, My Lord?

那对您又有多珍贵? 
Is that a precious thing to you?

这是他给曾侄孙女瓦妲的生日贺信
It's a birthday message to his grandniece Walda.

这是瓦德・佛雷的障眼法
Or so Walder Frey would have you think.

继续射杀出城的乌鸦 绝不能让瓦德大人把你的动向报告给兰尼斯特
Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.

他好歹是外公的封臣 为什么不肯支持我们? 
He's grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?

别对瓦德・佛雷抱任何期望 没有他干不出的事
Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised.

父亲正在地牢里受苦
Father rots in a dungeon.

随时可能掉脑袋
How long before they take his head?

我们得赶紧渡过三叉戟河 否则就来不及了
We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.

咱们干脆把大军开到城门口 叫他开门得了
Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing.

我们的兵力足足是他五倍 如果必要 你可以拿下孪河城
We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.

恐怕短时间内不行 而泰温・兰尼斯特正兼程北上
Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

佛雷家族把守渡口已经六百年 六百年来 他们从不忘收取过桥费
The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.

备马 我去谈判
Have my horse saddled and ready.

只身前往孪河城 他会把您卖给兰尼斯特
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

他会把你丢进地牢 甚或割了你喉咙
Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.

换成我父亲在这里 为了让部下渡河
My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing.

如今我是大军统帅
If I'm going to lead this army,

同样不能躲起来逃避责任
I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.

我从小就认识瓦德大人
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.

他不会对我怎样的
He would never harm me.

除非有利可图
Unless there was a profit in it.

大人 多年不见 今日重逢真是倍感喜悦
It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord.

你家儿子太尊贵 不愿亲自来见我
Your boy's too proud to come before me himself.

我又该拿你怎么办呢? 
What am I supposed to do with you?

父亲 您忘了吗? 史塔克夫人正是受您...
Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here

谁问你了? 我没死 你就不是佛雷侯爵 我看起来像死人吗? 
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

连我的私生子都教训起我待客之道啦? 
I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

要不是我把你小子播到你妈肚子里 她还在牧羊咧
Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

好吧 你过来
All right, you come forward.

喏 我已经行过礼了 或许我的儿子们可以赏个脸 给我闭上嘴巴
There. Now that I've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.

我们可否好好谈谈? 
Is there somewhere we can talk?

我们现在不就在谈? 
We're talking right now.

她的花蜜可是只给我一个人喝哟
And her honey's all mine.

我相信她会给您添许多儿子的
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

嘿 你老爸没来参加我的婚礼
Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.

他身体欠安 大人
He is quite ill, My Lord.

我上次结婚他也没来
Didn't come to the last one either.

还有上上次
Or the one before that.

你们家的人老是看我不顺眼
Your family has always pissed on me.

大人 我... 别否认 你很清楚我说的是实话
My Lord, IDon't deny it. You know it's true.

高高在上的徒利大人 死也不肯跟我联姻
The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.

恐怕当年事出有因...
I'm sure there were reasons why

我不想听原因 只想赶紧嫁掉儿女们 这帮兔崽子家里都快堆不下了
I didn't need reasons. I needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up?

我来请求您 打开城门 大人 让我儿子和他的军队渡过三叉戟河 赶赴前线
To ask you to open your gates, My Lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.

我为何要放他过去? 
Why should I let him?

你要是还能爬上自己的城墙 你会看到城外有他的两万精兵
If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.

等泰温・兰尼斯特赶到 他们就会变成两万具尸体
They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here.

史塔克夫人 你少吓唬我
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

你丈夫被关在红堡底下的牢房 你儿子连自个儿的卵蛋都偎不暖
Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.

你可是宣誓效忠于我父亲
You swore an oath to my father.

呵 可不是吗 我发过誓...
Oh yes, I said some words...

但没记错的话 我也宣誓效忠王室啊
And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right.

依我看 这会儿既然乔佛里是国王 你家小鬼以及外面那群活尸不就是叛徒嘛? 
Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

这事连鱼都知道
If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish,

按理说 我该把你们娘俩献给兰尼斯特
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

那你为什么不动手?  史塔克 徒利
Why don't you? Stark, Tully,

兰尼斯特 拜拉席恩 给我个好理由 我凭什么要管你们的闲事? 
Lannister, Baratheon, give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?

伊蒙估计你的手多久可以复原? 
When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?

到时候你就用这个
You'll be ready for this then.

我想狼比熊更适合你 所以把圆头重新打过了
I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear...

它名叫'长爪'
So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw.

瞧 狼和熊都有爪子
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

这是瓦雷利亚钢剑
This is Valyrian steel.

这是我父亲的剑 我祖父传给他的
It was my father's sword, his father before him.

这把剑在莫尔蒙家族传承了五百年
The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.

它本来属于我儿子乔拉
It was meant for my son Jorah.

但他让我们家族蒙羞 好歹他逃离维斯特洛之前 懂得留下这把剑
He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.

大人 您让我受宠若惊 可我不能...
My Lord, you honor me, but I can't

噢 你受之无愧
Oh, you can and you will.

若不是你和你那头狼 我就不会站在这里了
I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast.

差点被个见鬼的死人干掉...
A bloody dead man tried to kill me...

所以快拿去 别再跟我罗嗦
So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it.

听懂了没?  是 大人
Is that understood? Yes, My Lord.

很好 但别以为
Right. Now don't think this means

这代表我赞同你 顶撞艾里沙・索恩
I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

这是把成年人的剑 也只有成年人才配用它
That's a man's sword, it'll take a man to wield it.

我今晚就去跟艾里沙爵士道歉
I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

我昨天就派他去了君临
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

带着那只被你的狼 从那东西身上咬断的手
The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist

我命令索恩呈给
I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this...

这总该吸引小鬼头乔佛里的注意罢
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

而且如此一来 你和索恩就隔开了几千里
And it puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne.

你去罢 把剑收好 把我的晚餐端来
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.

干得漂亮 干得漂亮
Well done. Well done.

这是你应得的 雪诺
You earned that, Snow.

快过来让咱们瞧瞧罢
Go on, let's have a look.

瞧什么?  那把剑! 我们想瞧瞧那把剑
At what? The sword! Show us the sword.

拿剑来! 拿剑来! 拿剑来! 拿剑来!
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

放手 一边去
Piss off.Get off of it. Piss off.

快拿来 我要就着光亮好好欣赏
Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.

我... 我不该说这个
II'm really not supposed to say.

但你想说出来
And yet you really want to say.

你想说什么? 
You want to say that...?

是我读给伊蒙师傅听的
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

是你哥哥罗柏的事
It's your brother Robb.

不过不用担心 他召集了所有封臣 一定能平安归来
All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.

应该跟他并肩作战
I should be with him.

... 这意味着他们被送上了绝路
...If we do that, they'll never get back across.

瓦德大人会让你过河
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

他的军队也是你的
His men are yours as well

他还会亲率四百人防守河渡口 为你阻挡追兵
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.

他要我们怎样回报? 
And what does he want in return?

他的儿子奥利法将担任你的私人侍从
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.

过段时间以后 你要策封其为骑士 没问题
He expects a knighthood in good time. Fine fine.

还有艾莉亚 要嫁给瓦德大人的儿子瓦多...  ... 等两人成年以后 她不会喜欢的
And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age. She won't be happy about that.

还有 等战事结束...
And when the fighting is done...

你也将迎娶他一个女儿
You will marry one of his daughters.

你可以自己挑
Whichever you prefer.

他有好些个适合的... 人选
He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.

你有没看看她们长什么样? 
Did you get a look at his daughters?

那你就不能渡河
Not if you want to cross.

山姆说您有事找我? 
Sam said you wanted to see me?

或许你愿意好心地帮我个忙
Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.

告诉我 你可曾想过 为何守夜人 不娶妻也不生子? 
Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of The Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?

如此一来 他们才不会为情爱所困
So they will not love.

情爱是责任的大忌
Love is the death of duty.

假如有这么一天 你的父亲大人 必须在荣誉 和他所爱之人间做出抉择 他会怎么做? 
If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?

他会做他应该做的事 不管那是什么
He would do whatever was right. No matter what.

那么艾德大人是万里挑一的君子
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

多数人不如他这么坚强
Most of us are not so strong.

跟女人的情爱相比 荣誉算得了什么? 
What is honor compared to a woman's love?

跟怀抱中的初生幼儿 或是兄弟的笑容相比
And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?

责任又算得了什么? 
Or a brother's smile?

噢 当毋需付出代价时 自然都能尽忠职守
Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it.

坚守荣誉似乎是那么简单
Honor comes easy then.

然而 每个人生命中 迟早会遇到考验 那便是他必须抉择的时刻
Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.

您的意思是这样吗? 
Is that what you're saying?

孩子 这很痛苦
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh yes.

噢 可不是嘛 我知道 你不知道!
I know. You do not know!

就算我是私生子 但他依旧是我父亲 罗柏依旧是我哥哥
I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

天上诸神为我的誓言设下了残酷的考验
The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows.

他们直等到我步入老年之后
They waited till I was old.

乌鸦从南方带来我家族灭亡的消息 带来我亲人惨死的消息 我能做什么呢? 
What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family?

我这个身体虚弱的瞎眼老人 是如此无助
I was helpless, blind, frail.

可一旦想到 他们杀害了我弟弟的儿子 和他可怜的孙子
But when I heard they had killed my brother's son, and his poor son...

那些无辜的孩儿
Even the little children.

我父亲 是梅卡一世
My father was Maekar, the first of his name.

在他之后 我拒绝了王位 于是由我弟弟伊耿继承
My brother Aegon reigned after him when I had refused the Throne.

伊耿又将王位传给了他儿子伊里斯 也就是人们口中的'疯王'
And he was followed by his son Aerys, whom they called the Mad King.

您是伊蒙・坦格利安
You're Aemon Targaryen.

我是自学城毕业 立誓为黑城堡与守夜人奉献心力的学士
I'm a Maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch.

我不会要求你留下或是离开
I will not tell you to stay or go.

你必须自己做出抉择 然后一辈子与之相伴
You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of your days.

我的马... 我的马...
My steed...My...steed.

他从自己的马上摔下来
He fell from his horse.

无法骑马的卡奥便不再是卡奥
A Khal who cannor ride is no khal.

他累了 就是这样 他需要休息
He's tired,that's all.He needs to rest.

今天我们骑得也够远了 就在这里扎营
We have ridden far enough. We will camp here.

这里不能扎营
This is no place to camp.

女人无权命令我们停下 即便卡丽熙也不例外
A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

卓戈 卡奥
多斯拉克部族首领

我们就在这里扎营 就说这是卓戈卡奥的命令
We will camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. Qotho...

你无权命令我 卡丽熙
You do not command me, Khallesi.

去把弥丽・马兹・笃尔找到 带她来见我
Find Mirri Maaz Duur. Bring her to me.

巫魔女? 我会把她的脑袋带来 卡丽熙
The witch? I will bring you her head khaleesi.

把她毫发无损的带来 否则等卓戈醒来 他会知道你如何忤逆我
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear you defied me.

斥候回报 史塔克军已从孪河城南下 佛雷大人的部队加入了他们
Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

此刻敌军就在北边 距离我们一日行程
They're a day's march north.

小鬼不自量力 又没经验 不过倒确有点乡巴佬 初生牛犊不怕虎的劲头
The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.

继续说啊 别让我坏了你们的兴致
Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.

希望你那群野蛮人不要一无是处 否则我们精良的装备就白白浪费了
I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

那浑身是毛的高个子坚持要拿两把战斧...  还是黑色重钢 两面开刃的上等货
The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes heavy black steel, doublesided.

开战的时候 你和你那群野人将被放在前锋
When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

让我和原住民一起冲锋陷阵? 
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

他们看起来很威猛
They do seem rather ferocious.

威猛? 昨晚 有个月人部的为一根香肠 捅死了石鸦部的人
Ferocious? Last night a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

三个石鸦部的人抓住凶手 割了喉咙
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat.

波隆好不容易才阻止夏嘎剁掉死人的老二 不幸中的大幸 即便如此
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still

乌尔夫还坚决要求他们付赔偿金 而冈梭尔和夏嘎不肯
Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

士兵缺乏纪律 说明指挥官领导无方
When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.

再怎么想我死 也不能拿战争当儿戏吧
Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.

这事已经定了
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

我发现自己一点也不饿
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

兵荒马乱的 你打哪儿找来这么个漂亮妞? 
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?

抢的 抢的? 
I took her. Took her?

从谁手里?  从 呃...
From whom? From, uh...

忘了 三个帐篷外的棕发佬
I don't know. Ginger cunt three tents down.

他屁都没放一个? 
And he didn't have anything to say about it?

算了 我能不能活到 他来寻仇那天还难说咧
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate just dropped drastically.

我们明天打前锋
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

我还是给自己再找个妞吧
I... think I'll go and find myself one.

您希望我是谁? 
Who would you like me to be?

你母亲怎么称呼你? 
What did your mother call you?

您母亲又如何称呼您呢? 
What did your mother call you?

我母亲生我时难产而死
My mother died giving birth to me.

您叫我来就为这个? 谈论我们的母亲? 
Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?

你那是什么口音?  外国口音
What sort of accent is that? Foreign.

您想要我做什么? 
What do you want from me?

我想要你做什么? 
What do I want from you?

我要你和我一起住
I want you to share my tent.

为我倒酒 陪我说笑 每天在我奔波之后替我按摩双脚
I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride.

而且只要我们在一起 你就不许跟其他男人上床
I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together.

最重要的是 我要你拿出世界末日的劲头跟我风流快活 说不定明天真是世界末日
And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world which it may well be.

没人敢动我的妞
No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine.

其次 我的陪伴 我某些方面的口碑可是一等一的
Two: The pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular.

口碑? 您拿钱包上的婊子说的? 
Who told you this? Women you paid?

第三 你活上一千年也花不完的金子
And three: More gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years.

你接受我的条件吗? 
Do you accept my proposal?

就让我们从世界末日那部分开始吧
Let's start with your last night in this world.

多斯... 多斯拉...  克... 牦牛...  踩着...  黑色的鹳鸟...
Doth...Dothrae...  ki...yak...  might trample...  a black stork...

没人能比他强壮
No one understands how strong he is.

他熬不过今晚 卡丽熙 他不能死
He will die tonight, Khaleesi. He can't.

他不可以死 我不会让他死...
He can't. I won't let him.

这个命令超出了公主您的能力所及
Even a Queen doesn't have that power.

我们得赶紧走 听说亚夏有个繁盛的大港...
We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai

我不要离开他 您丈夫救不活了 卡丽熙
I won't leave him. He's already gone, Khaleesi.

即便他死了 我为什么要逃走? 
Even if he dies, why would I run?

我是卡丽熙 我的... 我的儿子将会继任卡奥
I am Khaleesi and mymy son will be Khal after Drogo.

这不是崇尚血统的维斯特洛
This isn't Westeros where men honor blood.

在这里力量决定一切 卓戈死后 他们会自相残杀
Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

胜者即为新的卡奥
Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal.

而他一定不会养虎为患
He won't want any rivals.

您的孩子刚出生就会被夺走 拿去喂狗
Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.

伤口化脓了
The wound has festered.

我不许你伤害她
I don't want her hurt.

住手? 住手? 你不许我伤害她? 
No? No? You don't want her hurt?

最好祈祷我们不要伤害你吧
Pray we don't hurt you too.

是你让巫魔女害了我们的卡奥
You let this witch put her hands on out Khal.

讲话小心一点 她仍然是你的卡丽熙
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

除非吾血之血还能活下去
Only while blood of my blood lives.

在他死后 她就什么也不是了
When he dies, she is nothing.

我从来不是无名之辈 我是真龙传人
I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon.

龙早就死绝了 卡丽熙
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

我想今晚你得穿上盔甲了 爵士
I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser.

您说得没错
I think you're right.

您又救了我一命
You've saved me once more.

换你救他一命了
And now you must save him.

已经没有任何医者可以救他
He's beyond the healer's skills.

我能做的 只是让他毫无痛苦的上路
All I can do is ease his path.

只要你救他 我就放你自由 我对天发誓
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

你一定还知道其他的办法...
You must know a way...

但对某些人而言 死亡反而比较干脆
Some would say death is cleaner.

你要黄金? 多少都可以
You'll have goldwhatever you want.

这不是黄金的问题 这是血魔法
It's not a matter of gold. This is Bloodmagic.

惟有死亡方能换取生命
Only death pays for life.

不 不是您的死 卡丽熙
No. Not your death, Khaleesi.

卡丽熙 这事做不得
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

请让我杀了这女巫吧 杀了她 你就是杀了你的卡奥
Let me kill this witch. Kill her and you kill your Khal.

可这是血魔法啊 这是禁忌
This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.

我是卡丽熙 我说不是就不是
I am your Khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.

夫人 您也得出去
You must go also, lady.

一旦我开始吟唱 任何人都不能进入这座帐篷
Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent.

今晚亡灵将在此舞蹈
The dead will dance here tonight.

请为我把他带回来
Bring him back to me.

我们本来可以去亚夏 这会儿够跑出去十里了
We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai.

您本来可以平安无事
You would have been safe.

这事不能继续
This must not be.This must not be.

你不能...
Nothing good will come of this.

站住 马王
No further, horselord.

... 要生了
The baby... Is coming.

把接生婆找来! 她们不肯来
Fetch the midwives. They will not come.

她们说她是被诅咒的人
They say she is cursed.

她们要么过来 要么我就把她们的头砍了
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

女巫... 女巫会接生
The witchshe can bring baby.

痛吗 我的狮子? 
Are you in agony, my lion?

不疼 可你的表情挺痛苦的
No. You look like you're in agony.

细皮嫩肉都给火焰烤到啦...
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

去你的 女人 你没有痛觉么? 
Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?

只是习惯了 你喝
Just used to it. Drink.

我们来玩个新游戏
Let's play a new game.

我知道一个布拉佛斯的匕首游戏...
There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you

这游戏没有掉手指头的危险吧? 
Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?

玩火 玩刀的都一边儿去
No more fire games, no knife games.

来玩个我拿手的
Let's do something I'm good at.

你什么拿手? 
What are you good at?

我自认看人很准
I happen to be a great judge of character.

似乎是个无聊的游戏 才怪
This sounds like a boring game. It's not.

游戏规则很简单: 我说出你的经历 说对了 你喝 说错了 我喝
Here's how it works: I make a statement about your past. If I'm right, you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink.

别撒谎 撒谎是瞒不过我的
And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.

我不想玩这个
I don't want to play this game.

你老爹打过你
Your father beat you.

我老娘打得更狠
But my mother hit harder.

没满十二岁你就开了杀戒 你的对手 你宰了他
You killed your first man before you were 12.

她抡斧子砍我
She swung an axe at me.

你去过长城北边
You've been North of the Wall.

去那边做什么? 
What brought you up there?

你很多年前真心爱过一个女人 却发现自己上了恶当 于是你再也不相信爱情了
You once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again.

到你了 神秘的东洋美女
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

我说了不想玩
I don't want to play.

这多有趣啊! 你看我们玩得多开心
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

你娘是个妓女
Your mother was a whore.

你爹在你很小的时候就离家出走 一去不回 你喝
Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return. Drink.

咱们不是说好只说实话吗? 
And we've established the rules about lying?

你想改变生活
You wanted a different life.

换个地方重新开始
You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.

这可以形容这操蛋世界里的每个人
The whole shitstained world could drink off that one.

那就说具体点...  你想换换手气 可为什么要来这里? 
So specifics you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?

肯定不是想来当静默姐妹
I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you.

一个出身低微的女孩能做什么呢...
So what's a lowborn girl to do?

再别谈论我的父母 不然我把你眼珠子抠出来
And don't talk about my mother and father ever or I will carve your eyes from your head.

亲爱的小姐 如有冒犯之处 我深表歉意
My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize.

看你有什么法子解开我这个谜
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

你爱过的女人是谁?  这不合游戏规则
Who were you in love with? That's not how the game works.

我才不管什么游戏规则
I don't care the way the game works.

我们这位大人结过婚
Our Lord here used to be married.

结过婚?  你从哪听来的? 
Married? How did you hear that?

跟兰尼斯特家的兵玩骰子可以听到不少故事
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

改天我或许会告诉你
Another night, perhaps.

不 就今晚
Not another night. This night.

这是个蛮伤感的故事
It's not a pleasant story.

也许我会哭哦 我猜这位小姐 和我的伤心事可比大人你多啊
Or maybe I will cry. I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship.

那年我十六岁 我老哥詹姆和我骑马回来 只听一声尖叫 她朝路上跑来 衣服扯破了 后面跟了两个男人
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off with two men on her heels.

詹姆几下就把他们赶跑了 我则用自己的斗蓬裹住她
Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

那女孩惊慌失措 不敢一个人走路 詹姆又一心只想逮着强奸犯
She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers

于是只能由我带她到附近的旅馆吃东西
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

是个车轮匠的遗孤
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

她很饿 我俩足足吃了三只烤鸡 又喝干一整壶酒
And she was hungry together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.

现在看来不可思议 但当时的我不会喝酒
Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

我乱了性 忘了自己有多害怕女孩们 怕她们嘲笑我 怕她们看见我就扭过头去 怕她们夸奖我那高大英俊的老哥
I forgot how afraid I was around girls, how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother.

我眼里只有泰莎
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

于是我跟她上了床
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

三只烤鸡啊 总不能白吃
For three chickens, I should hope so.

我的第一次 我他妈还没闹清楚就完事了...
It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

但她对我很好
But she was good to me.

事后吻了我 还给我唱了一首歌
She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song.

到隔天清晨 我已经爱上她了 便向她求婚
And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

讲几句谎话 塞几枚金币 再找个喝醉酒的修士 就这么成了... 一对小夫妻
A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon and there you have itman and wife.

两个星期后 那修士酒醒 便把事情禀报我老爸
For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up and told my father.

你的婚姻到此结束
I imagine that was the end of all that.

老爸先要我老哥跟我说实话
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

其实... 那女孩是个妓女
The girl was a whore, you see.

从那条路到那两个强奸犯 整件事都是詹姆安排好的
Jaime had arranged the whole thing, the road, the rapersall of it.

他认为让我体验男女之事的时刻到了
He thought it was time I had a woman.

詹姆坦白之后 老爸把我老婆叫进来 交给他手下的卫兵
After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards.

他出的价挺公道... 一人一枚银币
He paid her wella silver for each man.

你说多少妓女值这个价? 
How many whores command that kind of price?

他还逼我在军营里全程观赏
He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.

到后来她赚的银币多到拿不完 白花花的银子顺着指缝 洒了一地
By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor.

有人敢这样对我 我非宰了他不可
I would have killed the man who did that to me.

你早该知道她是个婊子
You should have known she was a whore.

我才十六岁 被爱情冲昏了头脑...
I was 16, drunk and in love

没有哪个险遭强暴的正常女孩 过两小时又去诱惑别的男人
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.

是啊 我当时太傻太天真
As I said, I was young and stupid.

你现在也是又傻又天真
You are still young and stupid.

怎么了? 你要干嘛? 
What is it? What do you want?

还睡! 打算贻误军机吗? 
You're sleeping through the war.

什么?  他们趁夜色抢先出击
What? They stole a night's march on us.

此刻就在北方一里处
They're a mile north.

叫侍从来帮我! 你没有侍从
Get my squire! You don't have a squire.

如果我死了 要为我掉眼泪
If I die, weep for me.

你人都死了 怎么会知道? 
You'll be dead. How will you know?

让开!  趴低点
Move aside!  stay low.

运气好的话 没人会注意到你
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

谷地的勇士们!  集合!
Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round!

黑耳部! 灼人部!
Black Ears! Burned Men!

月人部! 还有我们画犬部
Moon brothers! And painted dogs!

你们统治谷地的机会来了!
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

勇往直前 夺取一切!
Onward to claim what is yours!

你真是不经打
You're a shit warrior.

没赢我们有命聊天? 
We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.

那些原住民打得怎样? 
How did our tribesmen do?

好歹他们在战场上没打自己人
It's nice to see them getting along.

谢谢您的关注哟
Good of you to notice.

哼 探子的情报有误
Hmph. The scouts were wrong.

史塔克军只有两千 并非两万
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

那我们逮住史塔克小鬼了? 
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

自然是带着他剩下的一万八千人马
With his other 18,000 men.

去安全的地方吧 夫人 不
We should go, My Lady. No!

等他们反应过来 木已成舟
By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.

史塔克夫人 很乐意为您效劳 可惜我的剑不知掉哪儿去了
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it.

我不需要你的效劳
It's not your sword I want.

我要我的两个女儿
Give me my daughters back.

恐怕我也不知他们到哪儿去了
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

杀了他 罗柏 把他的头还给他父亲
Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father.

你亲眼看见 他砍倒了十个我们的人
He cut down 10 of our menyou saw him.

他活着比较有用
He's more use to us alive than dead.

把他带走 戴上镣铐
Take him away and put him in irons.

小鬼 我们可以在这里结束战争 省得生灵涂炭
We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives.

你代表史塔克家 我代表兰尼斯特家
You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters.

用剑用枪 用牙齿用指甲... 你来挑 咱俩就在这里分个高下
Swords or lances, teeth, nailschoose your weapons and let's end this here and now.

弑君者 照你说的方式来 你肯定会赢
If we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win.

我们有自己的方式
We're not doing it your way.

我让二千人去送死
I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.

吟游诗人将传唱他们的牺牲
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

这对死人来说又有什么意义呢? 
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

一次胜利不代表我们就成了征服者
One victory does not make us conquerors.

我们从王后手中救出我父亲了吗? 
Did we free my father?

救出我妹妹们了吗? 
Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen?

我们打败了那些企图奴役北境的恶人了吗? 
Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees?

战争还远未结束
This war is far from over.

柠檬... 或是什么口味都好
A lemon oneor any of them.

一只上好的肥鸽跟你换? 
How about a nice fat pigeon?

昨天没卖出去的也行
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?

烤糊了的也行 快滚!
Or any burnt ones? Piss off!

嘿 大家都去哪儿? 发生了什么事? 
Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?

他要被带到贝勒大圣堂
They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.

首相啊!
The Hand of the King.

临冬城公爵 暨国王之手
Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King.

我当着天上诸神和地上凡人的面 承认我的叛国罪行
I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men.

我背叛了我的国王和挚友劳勃...  ... 的信任与托付
I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert.

我发誓保护他的孩子 然而他尸骨未寒
I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold

我却阴谋杀害他的儿子...
I plotted to murder his son...

并自立为王
And seize the Throne for myself.

请总主教和'受神爱护的'贝勒 为我所说的作见证: 
Let the high Septon and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say:

乔佛里・拜拉席恩 乃铁王座唯一合法的继承人 以天上七神之名
Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the Grace of all the gods,

他是七国统治者 与全境守护者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

因为我们有罪 所以我们受苦
As we sin, so do we suffer.

此人当着天上诸神与地上凡人的面 坦承其罪行
This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men.

天上诸神是公正的 然而'受神祝福的'贝勒曾教导我们 他们也是仁慈的
The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful.

国王陛下 请问该如何处置这名叛徒呢? 
What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?

我的母亲敦请我让艾德公爵加入守夜人
My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

剥夺其一切头衔与权利 终生流放长城为王国服役
Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

而我的珊莎小姐 也多次为她父亲求情
And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father.

但那是她们软弱的妇女心肠使然
But they have the soft hearts of women.

只要我一日为王 叛国之罪必将严惩!
So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished.

伊林爵士 给我砍下他的头!
Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!

爸爸! 停下!
Daddy! Someone stop him!

儿子 这太疯狂了
My son, this is madness.

不要看! 放开我!
Don't look! Let me go.

放开我! 闭上嘴 看着我
Let me go! Shut your mouth. Look at me.

看着我! 停下! 爸爸!
Look at me! Stop! Daddy!

停下! 不 不! 国贼!
Stop! No no! Traitor!

看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me!

小子  记得我吗
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

认出我了吧  这才是好孩子
Remember me? There's a bright boy.

小子  你跟我走 把嘴巴闭上
You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

给我乖乖闭嘴  小子  我不是小子
Keep your mouth shut, boy.  I'm not a boy!

你不是聪明的小子  你是不是要说这个
You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say?

你想要命吗  小子
Do you want to live, boy?!

北方  小子  我们往北方去
North, boy, we're going north.

要我跟它走  我就随它去了
It told me to come with him, so I did.

我们下到墓窖  父亲正在那里
We went down into the crypts and my father was there.

你父亲不在底下  小少爷
Your father's not down there, little lord.

那是很多年后的事情
Not for many years yet.

你害怕了  跟阿多一样
You're afraid... just like Hodor.

一个地洞才吓不倒我
I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

你在长城外长大  有什么吓得倒你
You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of?

我只是个残废的小孩  我都敢下去
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

这是我爷爷瑞卡德公爵
That's my grandfather Lord Rickard.

他被疯王伊里斯活活烧死
He was burned alive by the Mad King Aerys.

那是莱安娜  我父亲的妹妹
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

劳勃国王本应该娶她 但雷加・坦格利安却把她强行掳走
King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

为了救回她  劳勃挑起了战争
Robert started a war to win her back.

他杀了雷加  可她还是死了
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

我就是在这里看到父亲的
That's where I saw father.

你瞧  他不在这里
You see? He's not here.

回来  毛毛狗  瑞肯
Here, shaggydog.  Rickon!

那头野东西应该被拴在狗舍里
That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!

他不喜欢被拴着  你在这里做什么
He doesn't like chains.  What are you doing down here?

跟我们回去吧  不要  我来看爸爸的
Come back up with us.  No, I came to see father.

我跟你说了多少次  他在君临城 珊莎和艾莉亚也是
How many times have I told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

他在这里  我看到他了
He was down here. I saw him.

昨晚 在我梦里
Last night, when I was sleeping.

总想他自然也会梦到他 并不会意味着...
It's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that...

你把剑都砍坏了
You've ruined your sword.

我要把他们全都杀掉
I'll kill them all...

一个不剩
...every one of them.

通通都杀掉
I will kill them all.

你妹妹在他们手里
They have your sisters.

我们要救回女孩们
We have to get the girls back.

然后再把他们杀干净
And then we will kill them all.

野猪尖牙利如刀
*The boar's great tusks, they boded ill*

劳勃国王命难逃
*for good King Robert's health*

野猪野猪肥又壮
*and the beast was every bit as fat*

和咱劳勃一般样
*as Robert was himself*

勇猛国王高声吼  '放马过来与我斗'
*But our brave king cried, 'Do your worst!*

劳勃国王败下场
*King Robert lost his battle and*

一世威名一朝丧
*he failed his final test*

先遭狮子爪下辱
*The lion ripped his balls off and*

又在野猪齿上亡
*the boar did all the rest*

这曲子多好笑啊
Isn't it a funny song?

感谢你的献唱
Thank you for your rendition.

我猜你在酒馆唱的时候一定更受欢迎
I imagine it was even better received at that tavern.

非常抱歉  陛下
I'm so sorry, your grace.

我发誓  我再也不唱这首歌了
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

告诉我  你更喜欢哪样 你的手指还是你的舌头
Tell me, which do you favor: your fingers or your tongue?

手指还是舌头
Fingers or your tongue?

如果只能留下一样  你选什么
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

还是说我直接割了你喉咙
Or I could just cut your throat.

人不能没有手啊  陛下
Every man needs hands, your grace.

那就舌头吧  陛下  开恩
Tongue it is.  Your grace, please.

我再也不唱了... 陛下
I won't sing... your grace.

伊林爵士  执行此刑 还有谁比你更合适呢  求您了
Ser Ilyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?  I beg you!

求您了陛下  我保证再也不唱歌了
Your grace, please. I beg you, I will never sing again!

今天到此为止  不
I'm done for the day.  Nooooo!

剩下的事情交给您了  母亲
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, mother.

'陛下'  我现在是国王了
'Your grace.' I'm king now.

陪我走走  我有东西给你看
Walk with me. I want to show you something.

照他说的做  孩子
Do as you're bid, child.

一旦你有了月事  我就会让你怀孕
And as soon as you've had your blood, I'll put a son in you.

母亲说不会太久了
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

这个是你父亲
This one's your father.

仔细瞧瞧  这就是叛徒的下场
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

你答应我会手下留情  我留情了
You promised to be merciful.  I was.

我让他死得干脆
I gave him a clean death.

求求您  让我回家吧
Please let me go home.

我保证不会背叛你
I won't do any treason, I swear.

母亲说我还是得娶你  所以你必须留在这儿 还要乖乖听话
Mother says I'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here and obey.

请问您还要我看多久
How long do I have to look?

直到我满意为止
As long as it pleases me.

还想看看其他人的吗
Do you want to see the rest?

只要陛下您高兴
If it please your grace.

这个是你的修女
That's your septa there.

我打算送你个礼物
I'm going to give you a present.

等我召集了自己的军队 杀了你的叛徒哥哥
After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother,

我要把他的首级也送给你
I'm going to give you his head as well.

说不定他会把你的脑袋拿来送我
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

母亲说国王不该动手打妻子
My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady.

还是要再教训你一次
Or do you need another lesson?

等会儿朝堂上见
I'll look for you in court.

小妹妹  学乖点  少挨揍
Save yourself some pain, girl.

他要怎样就怎样
Give him what he wants.

你以后还用得着
You'll be needing that again.

很明显应当这样做
The proper course is clear:

向蓝礼国王效忠  举兵南下 与他的大军会师
Pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.

蓝礼不是国王
Renly is not the king.

您总不能向乔佛里效忠吧  大人
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

他杀了您父亲
He put your father to death.

那不代表蓝礼就是国王
That doesn't make Renly king.

他是劳勃国王的二弟
He's Robert's youngest brother.

好比布兰不能先于我成为临冬城公爵
If Bran can't be lord of Winterfell before me,

蓝礼也不能先于史坦尼斯取得王位
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

那您是说我们支持史坦尼斯吗
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

蓝礼即位不合规矩  诸位大人
Renly is not right!  My lords.

如果我们支持史坦尼斯  诸位大人
If we put ourselves behind Stannis...  My lords!

听我说说我对这两个国王的看法
Here is what I say to these two kings...

蓝礼・拜拉席恩对我来说狗屁不是 史坦尼斯也一样
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither.

凭什么让那些坐着花花椅子的 南方人来统治我们
Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the south?

他们哪里懂得绝境长城和狼林
What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood?

就连他们信奉的神也不是真神
Even their gods are wrong!

咱们为什么就不能再次自己管自己呢
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

当年令我们臣服的是真龙 眼下真龙已经死光啦
It was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead!

只有一位国王让我心甘情愿地下跪
There sits the only king

他就在此座
I mean to bend my knee to...

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

这样的话  我也同意停战
I'll have peace on those terms.

就让他们继续守着红堡 和铁椅子好了
They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too.

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

我是否永远都是你的兄弟
Am I your brother, now and always?

不论凯歌高奏或是不幸败北 我的剑属于你  从今起  矢志不渝
My sword is yours, in victory and defeat from this day until my last day.

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁  北境之王万岁
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁  北境之王万岁
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁  北境之王万岁
The King in the North! The King in the North!

史塔克夫人  我要见他
Lady Stark.  I want to see him.

史塔克夫人  今晚您看上去迷人极了
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

孀居生活蛮适合您
Widowhood becomes you.

想必是孤枕难眠
Your bed must be lonely.

所以您才过来的吧
Is that why you came?

我现在状态不佳 不过应该还能为您效劳
I'm not at my best, but I think I could be of service.

不如您脱下袍子  看看我能否...
You slip out of that gown and we'll see if I'm up to...

我就喜欢暴力的女人
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

我要杀了你  爵士 将你的首级装在盒子里  给你姐姐送去
I will kill you tonight, Ser, pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.

我来教你怎么杀人
Let me show you how...

照我耳朵上方继续打
Hit me again, over the ear.

你的劲儿应当不小  用不了多久
You're stronger than you look... it shouldn't take long.

你就想让世人都相信
That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it?

你并不怕死  对吗
That you don't fear death.

我真不怕  夫人
But I don't, my lady.

黑暗降临  无人幸免  哭有何用
The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?

因为如果诸神公正 你必被打入七层地狱的最深渊
Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.

你丈夫顶礼膜拜的那些树吗
The trees your husband prayed to?

他掉脑袋的时候  那些树又在哪里
Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off?

如果你的神真的存在  如果他们真的公正 那为何世上尽是不公之事
If your gods are real and if they are just, why is the world so full of injustice?

就因为有像你这样的人
Because of men like you.

没人能像我  世上只有一个我
There are no men like me. Only me.

是怎么从塔上摔下来的
How did he come to fall from that tower?

是我把他推出窗外
I pushed him out the window.

我希望能摔死他
I hoped the fall would kill him.

你该去睡觉了
You should get some sleep.

这场战争远没到尽头
It's going to be a long war.

不敢相信  真打起来了
I can't believe we're actually at war.

你年轻时那场仗有没有这么刺激呀
Was it this exciting last time, when you were young?

我们抓住罗柏・史塔克了吗
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

下一步怎么做  闭嘴
What's our next move?  Stop talking.

看来史塔克小子没我们指望的那么嫩啊
The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.

听闻他的狼杀了十几个人  咬死十几匹马
I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.

关于史坦尼斯和蓝礼的消息是真的吗
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

拜拉席恩两兄弟都开始对付我们了
Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us.

詹姆被俘  围城军队又遭击溃
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

也许我们应该求和
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

打从乔佛里决定 取下奈德・史塔克的头开始就注定了
Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

眼下要跟罗柏・史塔克求和 比用地下这破杯装酒还难
You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now.

占上风的是他 难道您没发现
He's winning...  in case you hadn't noticed.

听说我们手上握有他的两个妹妹
I'm told we still have his sisters.

第一要务就是赎回詹姆爵士
The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.

不要求和  这是向敌人示弱
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.

我们应该立刻进兵
We should march on them at once.

我们应当先回凯岩城集结起...
First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise...

关于艾德・史塔克  你的判断没错
You were right about Eddard Stark.

假如他还活着  我们可以用他当筹码 与临冬城和奔流城达成停战 如此一来  便有时间 全力对付劳勃的两个弟弟  而眼下 胡来  完全是胡来
If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...  madness... madness and stupidity.

我原以为你生来只有杂耍的份
I always thought you were a stunted fool.

虽然我刚开始接触战略  但...  除非我们想遭受三面夹击 否则  此地不宜久留
I'm new to strategy, but...  unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

没人打算留在这里
No one will stay here.

格雷果爵士将率领五百骑兵 从神眼湖到红叉河  让河间地带化为焦土
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

剩下的人到赫伦堡集结
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

我要派你去君临
And you will go to King's Landing.

你将代我出任御前首相
You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead.

管管那位年轻的国王 如有必要  还要管管他的母亲
You will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too, if needs be.

倘若那几个重臣 有那么一点点居心不良的征兆
And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest:

贝里席  瓦里斯  派席尔
Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...

砍头  枪尖插着  挂上城墙
Heads, spikes, walls.

为何是我  不是别人
Why not anyone? Why me?

还有一件事 不准你带那个妓女进宫
Oh, one more thing: you will not take the whore to court.

他在哪儿  我要见他
Where is he? I want him.

孩子没活成
The boy did not live.

告诉我  您要我说什么
Tell me.  What is there to tell?

公主殿下  他根本就没活成
He never lived, my princess.

那些女人说什么
What do the women say?

她们说那孩子是...  怪物
They say the child was...  Monstrous,

我亲自帮他接生
I pulled him out myself.

他像蜥蜴一样全身长满鳞片 眼睛是瞎的  长了对蝙蝠样的小翅膀
He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat.

我一碰他  他的皮肉就从骨头上脱落
When I touched him the skin fell from his bones.

里面满满的都是蛆虫
Inside he was full of graveworms.

我警告过你  惟有死亡方能换取生命
I warned you that only death can pay for life.

我要看看 我用儿子的性命换来了什么
Show me what I bought with my son's life.

如您所愿  夫人
As you command, lady.

我带您去见他
I will take you to him.

以后有的是时间  我现在就要见他
Time enough for that later...  I want to see him now.

卓戈的卡拉萨走了
The Khalasar is gone.

无法骑马的卡奥没有资格当卡奥
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

多斯拉克人只追随强者
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

公主殿下  我很遗憾
I'm sorry, my princess.

卓戈・卡奥
多斯拉克部族首领

他为什么一个人待在这里
Why is he out here alone?

他似乎喜欢阳光的温暖  公主殿下
He seems to like the warmth, princess.

您要的是他的生命  您也支付了生命
You asked for life, you paid for life.

要多久他才会变回以前那样
When will he be as he was?

等太阳从西边升起  在东边落下
When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east.

等海水干枯
When the seas go dry.

山脉像枯叶一样随风吹落
When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

我不能让你单独和巫魔女在一起
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

我已经一无所有  没什么好怕她的了
I have nothing more to fear from this woman.

你明知我会得到什么  也明知代价是什么
You knew what I was buying and you knew the price.

他们烧了我的神庙  这是不对的
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

他们触怒了至高牧神
It angered the Great Shepherd.

神灵才不会做出这种事
This is not god's work.

我的孩子是无辜的  无辜的
My child was innocent.  Innocent?

他本来会成为骑着世界的骏马
He would have been the stallion who mounts the world.

如今他没有办法烧毁城市
Now he will burn no cities.

他的卡拉萨再也无法令其他国度灰飞烟灭了
Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.

孩子  你救我之前 我已经被三名骑手上过了
Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl.

我见到我神的庙堂遭到焚烧 而我曾在那里医治过不计其数的善男信女
I saw my god's house burn, there where I had healed men and women beyond counting.

街上随处可见堆堆人头 人头堆里有给我做面包吃的烘焙师傅 有罹患热病 好容易才救活的小男孩  也就三个月前的事
In the streets I saw piles of heads...  the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past.

你倒是说说看 你救了什么
So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved.

那就好好瞧瞧你的卡奥
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

让你明白当一切都消失的时候 生命究竟有何价值
Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.

山姆  别挡道
Get out of my way, Sam.

他们会放出话去
They'll put out the word.

派出渡鸦  会有人来追你的
They'll send out ravens. People will come after you.

你知道逃兵会有何下场吗
Do you know what happens to deserters?

你打算怎么做
What are you going to do?

直接去找我哥 然后亲手血刃乔佛里国王
I'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

你不能这样一走了之  大伙需要你
You can't leave us now. We need you here.

走开  我不会放你走
Move.  I won't let you go.

你老爸还说 不准你带任何人去君临
And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing.

不  他只说不准我带你去君临
No, he said I couldn't take you with me to King's Landing.

他特意强调这一点
He was very specific on that point.

他说'不准带雪伊去君临'吗
He said, 'Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing'?

相信他用的是'妓女'这个词
I believe he used the word 'Whore.'

怕我丢了你的脸吗
Are you ashamed of me?

怕我在宫廷上跳脱衣舞是吗
Are you afraid that i'm dancing around the court with my tits out?

我是可笑的妓女雪伊
I'm Shae the funny whore.

我老爸可能是海内最有权势的人
My father's probably the most powerful man in the country.

财力更是无人能及
Certainly the richest.

他可以将七国玩弄于股掌
He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets.

无论何人  来自何方 都要对他唯命是从
Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says.

他一直都这么混账
He's always been a cunt.

相信朝廷里的夫人小姐 能从你这样的姑娘身上学到很多
I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you.

不如就跟我一起进宫 做首相夫人怎样
Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady?

因为国王需要首相  而首相需要...
Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand...

我知道首相的需求
I know what a Hand needs.

他死了吗  没死
Is he dead?  No, he's not dead.

拜托  帮我扶他起来
Come on, help me get him up.

幸亏你皮糙肉厚
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

我们要把你带回属于你的地方
We're taking you back to where you belong.

我属于我的兄弟  我们就是你的兄弟
I belong with my brother.  But we're your brothers now.

如果他们发现你跑了  你会被砍头的
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

若是他们知道你们来追我  你们也会没命
They'll kill you if they know you came after me.

回去吧  山姆都跟我们说了
Go back.  Sam told us everything.

你父亲的事我们很遗憾  但那与你无关
We're sorry about your father.  But it doesn't matter.

一旦发了誓  你就不能离开
You took the oath. You can't leave.

我非走不可  不行
I have to.  You can't.

你发过誓了  我不在乎
You said the words.  I don't care about...

你们都见鬼去吧
To hell with all of you.

'长夜将至  我从今开始守望
'Night gathers and now my watch begins.

至死方休
It shall not end until my death.

我将尽忠职守  生死于斯'
I shall live and die at my post.'

'长城上的守卫
'The watcher on the walls,

守护王国的坚盾
The shield that guards the realms of men.

我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人 今夜如此  夜夜皆然'
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.'

当太阳从西边升起 在东边落下
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east...

你才会变回以前的模样  我的日和星
Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.

我可以告诉你国王们的一切
Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about kings.

关于那些国王  你要知道的事情是...
The thing you need to understand about kings is...

过去的六十七年里  我所了解 真正了解的国王比任何人都多
For the past 67 years, I've known...  truly known more kings than any man alive.

他们个个难以捉摸  不过我知道该如何辅佐
They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them.

而且从未失去我的位子
And keep on serving them.

诸神播撒给我们的众多劣性当中
Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us,

疯狂是最要命的
Madness is the worst.

他是个好人 非常有魅力
He was a good man, such a charmer.

眼见他在我面前日渐改变 迷失在血与火的迷梦之中
To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

劳勃・拜拉席恩则是头截然不同的猛兽 是个厉害的人物  伟大的战士
Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal...  powerful man, a great warrior...

但可惜的是  打江山容易 守江山难
But alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things.

人家说老罩着面甲过日子的人 容易看不到身侧的敌人
They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side.

而现在  我辅佐他儿子乔佛里国王 愿诸神保佑他国泰民安
Now I serve his son King Joffrey, may the gods bless his reign.

他是个能干的年轻人  好战心强
He is a capable young man... strong military mind.

而且严厉 不过对保护王国而言  严厉不算缺点
Stern...  but sternness in defense of the realm is no vice.

现在说他会成为怎样的国王  还为时尚早 但我能预料到  这位新国王必有丰功伟绩
It's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king.

你说  '关于国王  你要知道的事'
You said, 'The thing you need to understand about kings...'

你刚开始说的  算了
When you started, you... never mind.

我送你出去吧  亲爱的
Let me see you out, my dear.

没事  你坐着吧  好吧
It's all right. No need.  Yes yes.

想想看  你要是坐在上面会是什么样子
When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?

王冠合适吗  多年以来对你嗤之以鼻的 老爷夫人们会不会虚情假意地向你卑躬屈膝
Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?

没了脑袋  他们想卑躬屈膝也难
It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.

野心勃勃  而道德沦丧
A man with great ambition and no morals...

我可不敢与你为敌
I wouldn't bet against you.

我的朋友  要是你坐上去了 又会怎么做呢
And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?

我一定是城里为数不多的 对王座毫无兴趣的人
I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be king.

你一定是城里为数不多的 不算男人的男人
You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.

积点口德吧
Oh, you can do better than that.

你被阉的时候 是既取卵又杀鸡吗
When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones?

我一直都很好奇  是吗
I've always wondered.  Have you?

你还费心巴力地琢磨我下身是什么样子吗
Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?

我估摸着就像女人一样  是条缝
I picture a gash like a woman's.

我真是受宠若惊啊  还劳烦您琢磨我下身
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

虽说过了这么多年  你肯定还是不习惯吧 来自异国他乡 为众人所鄙夷 无人不畏惧
Must be strange for you, even after all these years...  a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all...

我是这样的吗  承蒙您告知
Am I? That is good to know.

你有没有因为害怕我那条缝而夜不能寐呀
Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?

但你挺了过来  在一任又一任的国王耳边 轻声低语
But you carry on, whispering in one king's ear and then the next.

我也钦佩您  贝里席大人
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

出身卑微  攀附权势  最大的才能就是 结交有权有势的主子  以及女主
A grasper from a minor house with a major talent for befriending powerful men and women.

很实用的才能  我相信你也同意
A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

所以呢  我们在这儿 彼此钦佩  互相尊重
So here we stand...  in mutual admiration and respect.

各位大人  可以开始了吗
My lords. Shall we begin?

你现在就叫阿利了  听到没
You're Arry now, hear me?

没人会盘问孤儿
No one asks an orphan too many questions

因为没人在乎
'cause nobody gives three shits.

路还长  和你作伴的都不是什么好东西
We have a long way to travel and in bad company.

这回我弄到二十个人 有大人  有小孩  全都送去长城
I have 20 this time, men and boys all bound for the Wall.

你父亲大人让我自己去牢里挑人 那儿可没啥贵族少爷之流
Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons and I didn't find no little lordlings down there.

这群人有一半连想都不想就会把你交给国王 以换取赦免
This lot, half of them would turn you over to the king quick as spit for a pardon.

而另一半也会这么做 不过会先强暴你再说
And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first.

所以你小心一点 要撒尿就自个儿到林子里撒
So keep to yourself...  and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

你和这帮人待着  小子
You stay with this lot, boy.

别乱跑 不然你就跟他们仨锁在马车后面
And stay...  or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.

看路  小矮子
Watch yourself, midget.

他竟然有一把剑
He's got a sword, this one.

你这种贱人要剑干嘛
What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?

说不定是哪家的小跟班
Maybe he's a little squire.

他才不是啥跟班  你瞧瞧
He ain't no squire. Look at him.

简直就一娘们儿
He looks like a girl.

我敢打赌  八成是偷来的
I bet he stole that sword.

我倒很想有这么一把剑哩
I could use me a sword like that.

你去抢来啊  拿剑来  小矮子
Take it off him.  Give it here, midget.

你最好把剑拿给热派
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

他以前把一个男孩活活踢死了
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

我把他揍倒在地  然后猛踢他老二 一直踢到他死为止
I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him until he was dead.

我把他踢得稀烂
I kicked him all to pieces.

你最好把剑拿来  你想要吗
You better give me that sword!  You want it?

我杀过一个小胖子
I already killed one fat boy.

我敢打赌  你没杀过人
I bet you never killed anyone.

你刚才那是撒谎  但我是说真的
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

我最会杀小胖子
I'm good at killing fat boys.

最喜欢杀小胖子
I like killing fat boys.

你就喜欢欺负小个子  是吧
Oh, you like picking on the little ones, do you?

要知道  我打铁有十年了
You know, I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years.

我打铁的时候  铁会唱歌
When I hit that steel, it sings.

我打你的时候  你会不会唱啊
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

这是城里铁匠用精钢打的
This is castleforged steel.

你从哪儿偷的
Where'd you steal it?

别人送我的  无所谓了
It was a gift.  It don't matter now.

我们要去的地方  没人计较你的过去
Where we're going, they don't care what you've done.

多得是强奸犯, 小偷, 强盗, 杀人犯
They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen ... murderers.

那你呢  武器师傅的学徒
Which are you?  Armorer's apprentice.

师傅不想要我了 就送我来这儿
But my master got sick of me, so here I am.

出发  你们这群婊子养的
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

从这儿到长城要赶上千里路 而且凛冬将至
It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall and winter is coming!

天天早餐都吃火腿 这到哪天才是头儿啊
How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham?

起码给我倒杯啤酒吧
Bring me some beer at least.

昨晚骑马就这么累啊
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

别害怕
Don't look so terrified.

要是我把每个半夜开溜的人都抓来砍头 那防守长城的就只剩鬼魂了
If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall.

好歹你没去鼹鼠村嫖妓
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

荣誉心驱使你离开 荣誉心也鞭策你回来
Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.

带我回来的是我的朋友们
My friends brought me back.

我又没说是你的荣誉心
I didn't say it was your honor.

他们杀害了我父亲
They killed my father.

你有办法让他起死回生吗
And you're going to bring him back to life, are you?

这种怪事我们可不希望再有了
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

长城外的游骑兵回报 好些村落完全被遗弃
Beyond the Wall, the rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned.

他们在夜晚看见群山中的火光 从黄昏直烧到天亮
At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn.

一个被抓的野人发誓说 许多部落齐聚到一处秘密要塞 他们目的为何  只有天上诸神知道
A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know.

卡特・派克的手下发现了四具蓝眼死尸
Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blueeyed corpses.

他们比我们聪明  直接就烧掉了
Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them.

你觉得你兄弟的战争 比我们这场战争更重要吗
Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?

不  等哪天夜里  死人 还有更邪乎的家伙大举入侵 你觉得谁坐在铁王座上还有差别吗
No.  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne?

等我们明天越墙北进时 我希望你和你那头狼与我们同在
Because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.

我不会干坐在这儿等风雪来临
I'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows.

我一定要知道究竟发生了什么
I mean to find out what's happening.

这次守夜人军团要大举出动 与敌人正面交锋  管它是野人 异鬼  还是别的什么东西
The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the white walkers and whatever else is out there.

我们要找到班扬・史塔克 不论是死是活
And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead.

我将亲自领军
I will command them myself.

所以呢  雪诺大人  我就问你一句
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

你究竟是守夜人的弟兄 还是只爱玩骑马打仗的私生小毛头
...Are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?

卓戈在夜晚的国度是用不着龙蛋的
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the night lands.

不如卖掉  然后返回自由城邦 所换的财富够您一辈子享用不尽
Sell them. You can return to the free cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

这些蛋不是要我拿去卖的
They were not given to me to sell.

我发誓效忠于您  奉行您的一切旨意 牺牲性命  在所不辞
I vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be,

但请让他去吧  卡丽熙
But let him go, Khaleesi.

我知道您的打算  千万不要啊
I know what you intend. Do not.

你不了解
You don't understand...

若您爬上卓戈的火葬台  休想叫我袖手旁观
Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.

我不能眼睁睁看您被火焚烧
I won't watch you burn.

你怕的就是这个
Is that what you fear?

你们将是我的卡拉萨
You will be my khalasar.

我看到的是奴隶的脸
I see the faces of slaves.

取下奴隶项圈吧  若要走  没人阻拦你们
Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

但如果你们选择留下 你们将彼此成为兄弟姐妹 或者男女夫妻
But if you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.

乔拉爵士  将这女人绑上火葬台
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

你发誓奉行我的意旨
You swore to obey me.

我是风暴降生丹妮莉丝 来自流淌古老瓦雷利亚血液的坦格利安家族
I am Daenerys Stormborn of house Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria.

我是龙的女儿
I am the dragon's daughter.

我向你们发誓 凡是伤害你们的人  必将哀嚎而死
And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.

你不会听见我的哀嚎
You will not hear me scream.

但我要的不是你的哀嚎
But it is not your screams I want.

打得确实漂亮 陛下
It was well struck,Your Grace.

这话我已经说过了
I already saidit was well struck.

接下来是谁?  罗索·布伦 效劳于贝里席大人麾下的自由骑手
Who's next?Lothor Brune, freerider in the serviceof Lord Baelish.

霍拉德家族的红骑士唐托斯爵士
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

霍拉德家族的红骑士唐托斯爵士!
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

我深表歉意
My deepest apologies.

呃 没有 没有醉 陛下
Uh, no.No, Your Grace.

我只喝了两杯, 两杯? 
I had two cups of wine. Two cups?

还不算多嘛
That's not much at all.

那就请再喝一杯吧
Please,have another cup.

说真的么 陛下? 
Are you sure, Your Grace?

没错 来庆祝一下我的命名日
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

整两杯 想喝多少喝多少
Have two.Have as much as you like.

我非常荣幸 陛下
I would be honored,Your Grace.

马林爵士 帮唐托斯爵士备酒以庆祝我的命名日
Ser Meryn, help Ser Don to scelebrate my name day.

让他喝个痛快
See that he drinks his fill.

我只是觉得若您在命名日杀人 恐怕会招来厄运 陛下
I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.

这是什么乡下人的迷信…
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

俗话说 命名日上播种子 一整年内结果子
What a man sows on his name day he reaps all year.

我明天再杀他 这蠢才
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

而您真是英明睿智 一眼就看出来了
A foolyou're so clever to see it.

此等蠢才天生是弄臣的料 而非骑士
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

他不配死得干净利落
He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

唐托斯爵士 你听见小姐说话了吗? 
Did you hear My Lady,Ser Dontos?

从今天起 你就是我的新弄臣
From this day,you'll be my new fool.

感谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

还有您 小姐 谢谢您
And you, My Lady,thank you.

我还在战场上四处找你嘞
We looked for you on the battlefield.

还真难瞧见您呐
You were nowhere to be found.

我一直在这 治理国家
I've been here,ruling the kingdoms.

你干得还真不错咧
What a fine job you've done.

比从前更动人了
More beautifulthan ever.

还有你啊! 你都快要比猎狗还壮实了 而且英俊多了
And you! Youyou're going to bebigger than the hound, but much better looking.

这家伙一点也不喜欢我
This one doesn't like me.

我们听说你早死了, 我很高兴你没死
We heard you were dead.I'm glad you're not dead.

死亡太乏味了 尤其是这当口 世上有那么多乐子呢
Death is so boring,especially now with so much excitement in the world.

小姐 我对您的不幸深感遗憾
My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

他爹可是个罪证确凿的叛徒
Her father wasa confessed traitor.

但仍是她父亲
But still her father.

亲爱的老爹都刚死不久 你俩该同病相怜才是
Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.

我的父亲是个叛徒
My father was a traitor.

我的母亲和哥哥也是叛徒
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

我绝对忠于我所深爱的乔佛里
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

好了 尽情享受你的命名日吧 陛下
Well, enjoy your name day,Your Grace.

多希望我能在这一起庆祝 但还有大事要处理
Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.

学城来了只乌鸦 就在今早 陛下
The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace.

说枢机会召开 分析研读了 七大王国所有学士的报告 继而宣布 这个长夏 终于结束了
The conclave has met,considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done at last.

这辈子我记忆里最长的一个夏天啊
The longest summer in living memory.

百姓们都说 漫长的夏季意味着 一个更漫长的冬季, 一个广为流传的迷信而已
The peasants say,a long summer means an even longer winter. A common superstition.

我们的存粮足以应对持续五年的冬季
We have enough wheat for a fiveyear winter.

如果冬季来得更长的话 我们怕是要失去一些百姓了
If it lasts any longer, we'll have fewer peasants.

难民纷纷逃离战争 都城要被他们淹没了 陛下
The city's drowning in refugees,Your Grace, fleeing the war.

我们没地方安置他们
We have nowhere to house them.

随着冬季来临 情况只会更糟
And with winter coming,it'll only get worse.

都城守备队不是听你差遣的么 史林特大人
You command the City Watch,do you not, Lord Slynt?

而你这个臣子难道不是听我差遣么? 
And are you not a Lord at my command?

我的头衔和领地都是您的慷慨恩赐 陛下
I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.

那么就干好你的本职 紧闭城门 别放一个农民进来
Then do your job.Shut the gates to the peasants.

他们该呆在田地里 而非涌进都城
They belong in the field,not our capital.

你比从前更迷人了 老姐
More ravishing than ever,big sister.

抱歉打断了大家 你们继续
Forgive the interruption.Carry on.

你来这里干什么? 
What are you doing here?

啊 可真是一次无与伦比的精彩旅行
Ah, it's been a remarkable journey.

我在长城边上撒尿
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

还在天牢里打盹
I slept in a sky cell,

跟高山部落并肩作战 这么多历险 这么多感激之情要表达啊
I fought with the hill tribes so many adventures, so much to be thankful for.

你来这里干什么? 这可是御前会议
What are you doing here? This is the small council.

是的 我知道 我相信作为国王之手 在御前会议总会受到欢迎的
Yes. well I, do believe, the Hand of the King, is welcome at all small council meetings.

我们的父亲才是国王之手
Our father is Hand of the King.

是的 但是他不在的时候呢…
Yes, but in his absence...

您父亲任命提利昂大人 在他作战时代行首相之职
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights.

我真想知道你是怎么连蒙带骗才让父亲这么决定的
I would like to know how you tricked father into this.

如果我有能力骗父亲
If I were capable of tricking father,

那么我现在已经君临全世界了
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

你这是自作自受
You brought this on yourself.

没错 你什么都没干 当你儿子要取奈德·史塔克项上人头的时候
Quite rightyou did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

现在整个北境都跳出来和我们作对了
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

我试过阻止, 是么? 可你失败了
I tried to stop it.Did you? You failed.

这场闹剧会困扰我们家族一整代人
That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

罗柏·史塔克只是个小屁孩, 一个百战百胜的小屁孩
Robb Stark is a child.Who's won every battle he's fought.

你没意识到我们就要输掉这场战争了么? 
Do you understand we're losing the war?

关于战争你懂些什么?  什么都不懂
What do you know about warfare? Nothing.

我知道我们的敌人彼此间的憎恨 和对我们的憎恨不相上下
And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.

乔佛里是国王, 乔佛里是国王
Joffrey is King. Joffrey is King.

你来这里是为了辅佐他
You are here to advise him.

我来这里也只是为了好好辅佐他
I'm only here to advise him.

而且 如果国王能照我说的去做 或许就能接他的詹姆舅舅回来
And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

你爱你的孩子
You love your children.

这是你难得的一项优点
It's your one redeeming quality.

还有你的脸蛋也算一个
That and your cheekbones.

史塔克也爱他们的孩子
The Starks love their children as well.

而我们手上正好有两个, 只剩一个了
And we have two of them.One.

就一个了?  艾莉亚这小鬼头 她消失了
One? Arya, little animalshe disappeared.

消失? 怎么消失? 伴着一股烟雾么? 
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

我们本有三个史塔克可以拿来讨价还价的
We had three Starks to trade.

你却砍了一个家伙的脑袋 又让另一个跑掉了
You chopped one's head off and let another escape.

父亲要被气坏了
Father will be furious.

对你来说这感觉一定很陌生吧 成了那个令他失望的孩子
It must be odd for you...  to be the disappointing child.

大人 愿旧神眷顾您的兄长 以及所有北境的子民
My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.

我城堡的墙可抵挡不了寒冬
The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter.

石料最后一次上灰浆还是伊里斯国王在位的时候 而我担心这一辈的石匠 已经没了他们父辈的技艺了
The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

在我还是个孩子的时候 我记得某年夏天 曾见过老石匠们在托伦方城建造一座新的塔楼
When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

当年人们干活就是干活
Men worked back then.

今天呢 我的城堡看起来就像是 毛头小子醉后用泥巴捏出来的
Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.

在夜里你能听见寒风从间隙呼啸吹过
At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.

到了下雨天 老天啊
And the Gods forbid it rains.

我还不如干脆睡到瀑布下面去
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

一座城堡的维护费用 通常都是由城堡的领主负责
Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

通常 确实如此 但我把所有的劳力都派往南方 为罗柏·史塔克作战去了
Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.

罗柏国王 而且这不是他挑起的战争
King Robb.And it's not his war.

或许是吧 大人 但他召集了封臣 带走了人手
Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners and took the men.

乔佛里杀了我父亲 你的封君
Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord.

你还记得你的誓言吗 爵士? 
Do you remember your vows, Ser?

我当然记得!
Of course I remember!

我们可以省出四位泥瓦匠借你一周 大人
We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord.

这样你能及时修复城墙么? 
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

我们可不想他杵在这一整天 是吧? 
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

可我不喜欢他谈论罗柏的口吻
I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.

但要体察下情 哪怕他们说话刺耳 这是你作为临冬城主的职责之一啊
But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.

大人 愿旧神保佑您的兄长 以及我们所有北境子民
My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.

把这个煮上一个小时当茶喝下去
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

你的疼痛就会消失
Makes all your pain go away.

你又开始做那些梦了
You've been having those dreams again.

我听见有人在谈论那颗彗星
Heard some of the men talking about the comet.

他们说那是个预兆
They say it's an omen.

他们说那意味着罗柏将从南方凯旋而归
They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.

我可听见其他傻瓜说那代表了兰尼斯特家的红色
I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.

意味着兰尼斯特家不久将一统七国
Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

还听见个马僮说那是血的颜色 代表了你父亲的死亡
Heard a stableboy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father.

星星不会为人而落下
The stars don't fall for men.

那红彗星只意味着一件事 孩子 龙
The red comet means one thing, boy dragons.

但龙都死了啊
The dragons are all dead.

它们都消失几个世纪了
They've been dead for centuries.

你哥哥是怎么描绘它们的 卡丽熙? 
What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?

他说它们吃肉
He said they ate meat.

但他没告诉你是哪种肉? 
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

我哥哥对龙一无所知
My brother didn't know anything about dragons.

其实他对什么都一无所知
He didn't know anything about anything.

她是卓戈给我的第一份礼物
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

我发过誓要保护他们
I promised to protect them.

发过誓要让他们的敌人在尖叫中死去
Promised them their enemies would die screaming.

可我怎么去让饥饿尖叫? 
How do I make starvation scream?

恐怕我也无能为力
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

我从来没向东走过这么远
This is farther east than I've ever been.

不过 有的 卡丽熙 万物皆有尽头 即便是红色荒原
But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.

那你确信就只有这一条路? 
And you're sure there's no other way?

倘若我们南下拉扎林 羊人们会杀了我们并夺走你的龙
If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.

若西进多斯拉克海 我们遇见的第一个卡拉萨 一样会杀光我们夺龙而去
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.

谁都别想夺走我的龙
No one will take my dragons.

它们已虚弱得无法战斗了 还有你的子民
They are too weak to fight, as are your people.

你必须成为他们力量的源泉
You must be their strength.

这不是个启程的好时机
This is bad time to start.

旅途上辛苦吧? 
Having a rough time of it?

起码我还没死
Nothing's killed me yet.

你的肥屁股可把雪橇坐坏了, 是你说要载我的
Your ass killed the sledge.You offered me a ride.

我只希望让你闭嘴别谈你那些该死的水泡了
I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.

我就是在这样的地方出生的
I was born in a place like this.

那还算是我过的快活日子咧
Later, I fell on hard times.

我可六个月没见过姑娘啦
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

我若是你就继续假装没见着
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

咋了 他不喜欢有人戏弄他的女儿们? 
What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?

他不喜欢有人调戏他的妻子们
He don't like people messing with his wives.

他娶了他的女儿们 而她们给他更多女儿
He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.

于是如此往复
And on and on it goes.

那太恶心了, 那可不光是恶心
That's foul.It's beyond foul.

几百里格之内所有的野人都消失了
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

卡斯特却依然在这稳如泰山
Craster's still here.

他肯定有过人之处
He must be doing something right.

那他的儿子们呢? 
What happens to the boys?

嗯?  他娶自己的女儿
Hmm? He marries his daughters.

那他的儿子们呢? 
What does he do with his sons?

他说他计划在去霜雪之牙的路上 在这留一宿
He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.

人们总是计划这计划那
People make all sorts of plans.

我可三年没见着班扬·史塔克啦
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

他老把我看成个渣滓
Always treated me like scum.

好久没喝过什么好酒了
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

你们南方佬就是酿得一手好酒 这我可认了
You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.

我们不是南方佬
We're not Southerners.

这又是哪个小美人? 
Who's this little girl?

你可比我半数的女儿都漂亮些
You're prettier than half my daughters.

你两腿间那玩意湿了没? 
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

听我说 杂种
Listen to me, bastard.

你们全来自长城以南 你们这群南方佬
All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners.

不过现在你们在北境 真正的北境
But now you're in the North, the real North.

那小子没恶意
The lad meant no harm.

我撞见那漂亮的小杂种在和我女儿们交谈
I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters

没人会再靠近你的女儿们 我保证
No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.

现在 给我坐下 然后闭嘴
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

你这次带了那种好酒没? 
You bring any of that good wine with you?

我们途经六座村镇
We passed through six villages on the way here.

它们全被遗弃了
All six were abandoned.

那些野人都去哪里了? 
Where have all the wildlings gone?

我本可以告诉你 可惜我渴了
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

雪橇上有桶多恩好酒
There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.

把它拿过来, 是 总司令
Bring it in here. Yes, commander.

你想知道他们去哪了? 
You want to know where they've all gone?

朝北…去加入曼斯·雷德…
North... to join up with Mance Rayder...

他才不是我的朋友
He's no friend of mine.

他破誓 背叛了他的兄弟们
He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.

但他原本不过是个穷黑乌鸦
But once he was just a poor black crow.

而现在却是塞外之王
And now he's KingBeyondtheWall.

他都这么叫自己好些年头了
He's been calling himself that for years.

他算什么国王? 某个小破冰湖的国王? 
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

那斧头样式不错
That's a goodlooking axe.

回黑城堡再给你打一把
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

喔 真是好铁打的
Oh, that's some lovely steel.

你想知道曼斯·雷德在干嘛吗? 
You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?

据我所知 他手头的兵力 已经超过你们任何一个南方的国王
What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.

那么他准备向哪里进军? 
And where does he plan marching this army?

一旦你们往北出发 那就只有一条路可走
When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.

如今是艰难时代 独居荒野很不妥啊
These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.

冷风已然吹起
The cold winds are rising.

让它们吹 我的根基深得很
Let them come.My roots are sunk deep.

老婆 告诉乌鸦大人我们有多喜欢这地方
Wife...  tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

我们的丈夫保护我们的安全
Our husband keeps us safe.

我们宁可身为自由人而死 也决不当奴隶
Better to live free than die a slave.

可千万别羡慕嫉妒 老头子 看我身边这么多年轻老婆 而你却连个暖床的人都没有
Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?

我们选择了不同的道路
We chose different paths.

噢 当然 你选择了一条只有男孩一起的道路
Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it.

你们大概很想睡在我的屋檐下吧 只怕还想把我的猪报销光呢
You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.

有个屋檐咱们感激不尽
A roof would be welcome.

我们走了很长的路
It's been hard riding.

我们自带了食物还有给你的上好铁器
We've brought our own food and good steel for you.

哪只臭手敢碰我老婆一下 我就把它剁掉
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.

这家伙盯着看了很久
And I see this one staring too long,

看来得把他的眼珠子挖出来
I might just gouge his eyes out.

你的地盘 你说了算
Your roof, your rules.

我是谁? ! 总司令大人
Who am I?! Lord commander.

那么你是谁?  琼恩·雪诺
And who are you? Jon Snow.

你想要有朝一日做统帅? 
You want to lead one day?

那就先学会听从命令
Then learn how to follow.

光之王啊 吾人身处黑暗之中 请降临于此
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.

我们将这些虚伪诸神奉献于您
We offer you these false Gods.

请取走他们 将您的光明赐予我们
Take them and cast your light upon us...

梅丽珊卓
'光之王'的红袍祭司

因为长夜黑暗 处处险恶
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

因为长夜黑暗 处处险恶
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

长夏已尽 黑暗将以山崩之势压向整个世界
After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world.

星辰泣血
The stars will bleed.

凛冬之息将冰封海洋
The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas...

死人将于北方崛起
...And the dead shall rise in the North.

你们这些人都是在七神的庇佑下长大的
All you men were named in the Light of the Seven!

这就是你们对待父辈的神灵的方式? 
Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers?

你们如此焦急地想要唾弃你们的先祖? 
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

你身上尽是恐惧的气息 恐惧无能的老骨头
You smell of fear fear and piss and old bones.

你想要阻止我? 
Do you want to stop me?

上古书籍预言 将有一位斗士自烈火中拔出燃烧之剑
In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.

燃烧之剑'光明使者'
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩 光明的斗士 你的剑正在等着你
Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.

真主啊! 请将您的光明赐给我们!
Lord, cast your light upon us!

因为长夜黑暗 处处险恶
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

因为长夜黑暗 处处险恶
For the night is dark and full of terror.

这个女人会把他引向一场无法取胜的战争
This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.

他下令 我们跟随 即使我们不喜欢他的命令, 国王
We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.King.

自从他的哥哥死在野猪獠牙之下 每个领主都想做国王
Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.

我不侍奉别的国王 我只侍奉史坦尼斯
I don't serve the others.I serve Stannis.

我亦如此 但是忠诚的侍奉 意味着进谏逆耳忠言
As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths.

陛下身边遍布庸才和狂热的信徒 但是他唯独信任你 戴佛斯
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos.

假如你告诉他真相
If you tell him the truth...

吾在此以家族之荣誉起誓 吾所深深敬爱之兄长劳勃 他不是我'深深敬爱之兄长'
'And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert' he wasn't my beloved brother.

我们之间没有什么感情
I didn't love him.He didn't love me.

陛下 这不过是敬语 无伤大雅
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

吾之兄长劳勃 并无后嗣以继王位 盖男童乔佛里 男童托曼 与女童弥赛菈实乃 瑟曦·兰尼斯特与其弟詹姆·兰尼斯特乱伦所生之孽种
'...that my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister.

根据继承与血统,  '弑君者'詹姆·兰尼斯特
By right of birth' Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

与其弟'弑君者'詹姆·兰尼斯特 乱伦所生之孽种
'...And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

根据继承与血统的律法 吾于今日声明
By right of birth and blood, i do this day lay claim'

改成'弑君者'詹姆·兰尼斯特爵士
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

不论此人行径为何 他终究是个骑士
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

'弑君者'詹姆·兰尼斯特爵士乱伦所生之孽种
'Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

根据继承与血统的律法
By right of birth and blood,

吾于今日声明 吾乃维斯特洛铁王座之所有人
I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

勤王者应立刻宣誓效忠
Let all true men declare their loyalty.'

艾德·史塔克获悉真相之时 仅仅知会我一人
When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me.

我不会犯同样的错误
I'll not make the same mistake.

把抄本送到七大王国每一个角落 从青亭岛直到长城
Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.

是时候选择阵营了
The time has come to choose.

让他们无法把无知当做借口
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

陛下 兰尼斯特家族才是我们真正的敌人
Your Grace,the Lannisters are the true enemy.

假如 您暂时和您的弟弟修归于好
If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother

我绝不跟蓝礼妥协 除非他放弃称王
I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.

但是 很多家族都已经宣誓效忠于他
Well, many have already declared for him

梅斯·提利尔 蓝道·塔利
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

史坦尼斯陛下无需向此大人彼大人哀求支持
Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.

他有光之王的庇佑
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

那么光之王手里有多少艘战船? 
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

光之王无需战船, 他当然不需要 但是我们需要战船来打仗
He has no need for ships.I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war.

陛下 除了蓝礼 我们可以拉拢罗柏·史塔克
If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.

他想窃取整个北境 我的半个王国
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.

正如你所知 戴佛斯爵士 我对待每个窃贼都有适合他的处理方式
I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know,Ser Davos.

乔佛里 蓝礼 罗柏·史塔克 全都是窃国大盗
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

他们必须屈膝称臣 否则只有毁灭一途
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

陛下 请恕我冒犯
I owe you an apology, my King.

您已经选择了新的神灵 放弃了旧的七神
You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods.

愿光之王保佑我们
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

您可愿意同我喝一杯? 
Shall we drink together?

向唯一的真神致敬
A cup of wine to honor the one true God.

老头子 长夜黑暗 处处险恶 但是烈火将濯尽一切
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away.

我曾希望你能把我留在 随便哪个城堡里踏踏实实关着我 但是你却把我在各个营地之间拖来拖去
I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp.

史塔克 我看你是爱上我了吧? 
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

我从没见你跟姑娘在一块儿
I've never seen you with a girl.

假如我把你留在我任何一个封臣手里 你父亲会在两周之内获悉此事 并给我的封臣送来一只乌鸦 告诉他
If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message:

'放了我儿子, 那么你将得到做梦也得不到的财富
'Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

否则, 你的家族将会被连根拔起, 灰飞烟灭'
Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.'

那些人跟随你上战场 你却不信任他们的忠诚? 
You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?

噢 我赌上自己的身家性命来相信他们 但是不能用你的小命来冒险
Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours.

不喜欢被别人喊'孩子'? 
Don't like being called 'boy'?

弑君者 你在侮辱你自己
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

你被一个孩子打败
You've been defeated by a boy.

你被一个孩子所俘虏
You're held captive by a boy.

也许 你还会被一个孩子所杀
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩派出了乌鸦 致信维斯特洛所有的领主大人
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros.

乔佛里·拜拉席恩既不是真正的国王 也不是一个真正的拜拉席恩
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon.

他是你们乱伦所生的孽种
He's your bastard son.

如果这是真的 那史坦尼斯就成了合法的国王
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

对于他来说是何等方便啊
How convenient for him.

我父亲发现了真相
My father learned the truth.

这就是他被你们处死的原因
That's why you had him executed.

奈德·史塔克掉脑袋的时候 我可是你的俘虏
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

是你儿子杀了他 好欺瞒世人 掩盖他的真实身世
Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

而你 你将我的弟弟从窗户推出去 就因为他撞见了你和王后在一起
And youyou pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.

还是说 你就跟那些爱嚼舌根的渔妇一样喜欢散播谣言? 
Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?

我将派遣你的一个堂弟南下君临 去传达我的和谈条件
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.

你觉得我父亲会跟你谈条件? 
You think my father's going to negotiate with you?

看来你并不怎么了解他嘛
You don't know him very well.

是的 但是他得试着了解我了
No, but he's starting to know me.

三场胜利无法证明你就是个征服者
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

总好过三场失败
It's better than three defeats.

我还以为你会愿意来此
I thought you wanted to come here.

原来你喜欢尸体和屎尿的味道? 
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

还有精液 大蒜 和甜酒
And cum and garlic and rum.

你竟然能从阳台上嗅出精液的味道? 
You can smell cum from the balcony?

我爱这恶臭 我爱这嘈杂
I love the stink.I love the noise.

这城市让我性致高昂
Cities make me want to fuck.

这个王国也是么? 
And so did the country.

这才是我的归属地
This is where I belong.

哦? 那你可得小心一点
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

不能让人知道你在这里
No one can know you're here.

在君临 你不能相信任何人
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

他们都是骗子 精明的骗子 蹩脚的骗子 还有一到两个是绝世的骗术高手
They're all liarsgood liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.

我? 我可不属于这里 我可是追随'真相'的忠实仆从
Me? I'm not from here.I'm a slave to the truth.

你可是我见过的最大的小骗子
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

你为什么觉得我很小? 
Why do you think I am so little?

我简直被'真相'压得直不起腰来了
I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.

奈德·史塔克竟然真的睡在这里
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

好像他这个可怜鬼还没遭够罪一般
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

现在我得对这里做一点 小小的改变了
One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.

贝里席大人, 陛下
Lord Baelish.Your Grace.

有一件事不知能否得您相助
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

当然 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

奈德·史塔克的小女儿艾莉亚 我们不知她去了哪
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya we can't seem to locate her.

如果她已经逃离了君临
If she's escaped the capital,

临冬城怕是最合情合理的去处
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

但我在北方的朋友并未窥见她的踪迹
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.

如果我们选择跟史塔克谈判 这女孩还是很有价值的 不管谁找到她 当然 你也知道人们总说'兰尼斯特有债必偿'
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value.Whoever finds her well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.

也许你可以问问瓦里斯是否知道她的踪迹
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

他也许会有答案
He'll have an answer for you.

不管你是否信任他
Whether you believe it...

就我来说嘛 总是不太容易信任太监们
Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.

谁知道他们到底想要什么? 
Who knows what they want?

你自创的家徽 是么? 
You created your own Sigil, didn't you?

很适合你 作为一个白手起家之人 这般巧舌如簧
Appropriate... for a selfmade man with so many songs to sing.

我很高兴您能欣赏它
I'm glad you like it.

有的人前世有福 有幸降生于显赫家族
Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.

另一些人却只好自力更生
Others have to find their own way.

我曾听过一首歌谣 讲的是一个出身低微的男孩 想方设法意图融入某个显赫家族的故事
I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.

他曾经爱上这个家族的长女
He loved the eldest daughter.

令人悲伤的是 她的心另有所属
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

当男孩女孩居于同一屋檐之下 难免会有尴尬的情形发生
When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise.

有时候 我听说就算亲生兄弟姐妹 也会彼此萌生爱意
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections.

当这种爱意 为众人所知时 显然 这就尴尬得很了 尤其是对一个显赫的家庭来说
And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family.

但他们总是忽视一个很简单的真理
But prominent families often forget a simple truth,

什么真理? 
And which truth is that?

我改变主意了 放了他
I've changed my mind.Let him go.

后退三步
Step back three paces.

如果你能将你那点精力 从铜板和妓女身上挪开一点 去帮忙寻找史塔克家的小姑娘
Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me.

我自会感激不尽
I would very much appreciate it.

你就是阿尔顿·兰尼斯特爵士? 
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

我将为你的家族奉上和平 只要他们能满足我的条件
I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms.

第一 你的族人必须立即释放我的两个妹妹
First, your family must release my sisters.

第二 立即归还先父遗骨 我们将遂先父所愿 将他安葬于临冬城的墓窖 让他和兄妹们一同长眠于地下 共享安宁
Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

那些追随他而死于君临的将士们的遗体 也必须归还
And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.

好让其家人为他们举行体面妥帖的葬礼
Their families can honor them with proper funerals.

这是个富有荣誉感的要求 陛下, 第三
An honorable request, Your Grace.Third...

乔佛里和摄政太后必须公示全境 放弃对北境的统治权
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.

从此时此刻 直至时间的尽头 我们都将是自由独立的北境王国
From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.

北境之王万岁
The King in the North.

乔佛里和他的军队 将再也不能踏入我们的领土一步
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.

如果他无视这一命令 他将迎来与我父亲同样的命运 唯一的区别是 摘掉他的脑袋 我无需刽子手代劳
If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.

这些是…陛下 这些… 这些就是我的条件
These are... Your Grace, these are...  these are my terms.

倘若摄政太后和她的儿子接受 我就给他们和平
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace.

我大军即刻南下 让兰尼斯特家族灰飞烟灭
I will litter the south with Lannister dead.

乔佛里国王属于拜拉席恩家族 陛下
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

你将在黎明时分出发 阿尔顿爵士
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

今晚的会议到此为止吧
That will be all for tonight.

咱俩单独相处的时候 你没必要叫我'陛下'
You don't have to call me 'Your Grace' when no one's around.

一旦你习惯之后 这也不是坏事
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

我倒是很高兴有人已经开始习惯如此了
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

兰尼斯特不会接受你的条件的 你难道不知? 
The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?

我们在战场上一直所向披靡 但是不拿下君临我们就无法彻底将其击败
We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.

而没有船舰 我们拿不下君临
And we can't take King's Landing without ships.

我父亲拥有舰队 麾下铁种深谙水性
My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.

他们曾起兵对抗我父亲
Men who fought my father.

他们是为获得自由而反抗劳勃国王 为了摆脱南方佬的束缚 正如你现在所走的路一般
Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now.

我是他唯一仍在世的儿子
I'm his only living son.

他会听我的建议 我知道他会的
He'll listen to me.I know he will.

我明白 我不是一个史塔克
I'm not a Stark.I know that.

但你的父亲养育教导我成为一个重视荣誉之人
But your father raised me to be an honorable man.

让我们一起为他复仇吧
We can avenge him together.

你万万不可与巴隆·葛雷乔伊结盟
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

我需要他的舰队 据说不下两百艘
I need his ships.They say he has 200.

据说还说君临的下水沟里还藏着上百万的老鼠呢
They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.

我们能召集它们为我们而战? 
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

我知道你不相信巴隆大王
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

我不相信巴隆大王是因为他压根不值得相信
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.

你父亲曾要上战场镇压他的叛乱
Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.

是的 而如今反抗铁王座的却正是我
Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.

在我之前, 还有父亲
Before me, it was father.

你不仅嫁了个反叛者 还生了一个
You married one rebel and mothered another.

我生的可不仅仅是个反叛者 看样子你忘了这个事实
I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.

如果我拿弑君者去交换我的两个妹妹 我旗下的封臣怕是会将我倒吊城墙之上
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

你忍心让珊莎任由王后摆布
You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands?

我还没有听到关于艾莉亚的只言片语
I haven't heard a word about Arya.

要不是为了把你妹妹们夺回来 我们还有什么好打的? 
What are we fighting for if not for them?

事实比这个要麻烦的多!
It's more complicated than that!

看样子我是该回家了
It's time for me to go home.

我已经几个月没见到布兰和瑞肯
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

你不能返回临冬城
You can't go to Winterfell.

我将派遣罗德里克爵士北上去看护好弟弟们 明日你将骑马南下去风暴地
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

看在诸神的份上给我个原因 因为我需要你和蓝礼·拜拉席恩谈判
Why in the name of all the Gods because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

他集结了十万大军
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

你认识他 你了解他的家族
You know him.You know his family.

我上次见到蓝礼时他不过是个孩子
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.

你麾下领主 将士如云 为什么偏偏
You have a hundred other lords

人们是怎么形容坦格利安家族的? 他们是征服者

我需要能与之匹配的王座厅 而不是美酒鲜花
It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.

我们找不到艾莉亚·史塔克的下落
We can't find Arya Stark.

如果她走运的话 想必是烂在某条水沟里了
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

也许吧 但如果她还活着 我们要找到她
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

只有珊莎 他们不会放还詹姆
They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.

我可不这么认为 北方佬不过是一群懦夫
I think they might.They're weak.

他们太把女人当回事
They put too much value on their women.

我们需要立刻派遣人马去找到她
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.

越多越好
Send out as many men as we can.

我相信如果你向外公请示
I'm sure if you asked grandfather

国王无须请示任何人 只须下令!
The King does not ask; He commands.

外公在战场上的愚蠢和失误 才是导致詹姆舅舅被罗柏所擒的原因呢
And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

他的生命危在旦夕
His life is in danger.

谁都是朝不保夕
All our lives are in danger.

我倒是有听说关于詹姆舅舅的肮脏流言
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

我们的敌人会想尽任何言辞 来诋毁削弱你继承铁王座之权的合法性
Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.

这不是权利 铁王座本就是我的
It's not a claim.The throne is mine.

没有人会相信这些卑鄙的流言蜚语
No one believes this foul gossip.

父王还有其他孩子? 
Father had other children?

除了我 托曼和弥赛菈? 
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

我想问他是否操过其他女人 在他厌倦了你之后
I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you.

他在外面到底有多少野种

你刚才的所作所为 论罪本当处死
What you just did is punishable by death.

你决不能再犯
You will never do it again.

就这样吧 母亲
That will be all, Mother.

你知道你听起来有多滑稽荒谬吗? 
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

慢慢来 带点激情
Slowly, with passion.

去把你们自己洗干净 穿点衣服
Go wash yourselves.Put some clothes on.

今天晚上你们都得接客
Both of you are working tonight.

在这儿我们可不那么办事 黛西
We do things differently here, Daisy.

这可不是枯草厅那些五个铜板就能干一番的廉价窑子
This isn't some fivecopper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

是干草厅, 谁管你从哪儿来的
Haystack Hall.Wherever you're from.

我们可不招待那些 种地的和放羊的
Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders.

在这里 品位最重要
Taste is everything here.

小指头真是位贵人
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

别叫他小指头
Don't call him Littlefinger.

她假装不懂通用语 好让客人们当她来自异域
She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic.

其实她不过是在跳蚤窝下面的巷子里长大
She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

不过是个不说话的婊子 但对男人们屡试不爽
She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot.

很高兴再次…见到您
Good to see you...Again.

我想您应该知道这家店的老板 是培提尔·贝里席大人吧 国王陛下的财政大臣…
You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin...

管理着流到众人口袋腰包里的钱币
Coin which goes in many pockets.

某位根本不在乎小指头怎么想的人之命
Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.

不 你不能这样! 不! 请不要!
No, you can't.No! Please!

求求您了! 求求你们!! 够了 下手吧
Please. Please.Enough. Get it done.

杀了这杂种, 不 不要啊!
Kill the bastard.No, no!

分头行动 搜索每间屋子
Spread out.Search every house.

每间屋子 每个角落
Every room.Look in every room.

詹德利! 他的名字是詹德利!

Where is the bastard?

和守夜人走了! 求您了 放过我吧!
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

他们带他朝国王大道北上了
They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north.

我们怎么认出他来?  他戴了顶牛角盔
How will we know him? He's got a bull's head helmet.

他自己做的, 找到他
He made it himself.Find him.

天黑之前必须收拾停当
Gotta be ready before nightfall.

在山脊那边再安排个岗哨 树上也要
Put a watch on the Ridge and the tree lines.

某人一天一夜没喝过东西了
A man does not drink for a day and a night.

某男孩可以交个朋友
A boy could make a friend.

拿麦酒来 否则扒了你的皮
Give us beer before I skin you.

这两个人 他们没有礼貌

此人很荣幸是贾昆·赫加尔 从自由贸易城邦罗拉斯而来
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar, once of the free city of

嘿 你这小王八蛋
Beer, you little shit.

你应该好好说
You should have asked nicely.

你过来啊! 我要拿那根棍子插你屁眼 活活干死你!
Come closer and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.

男孩很勇敢 但不理智
A boy has more courage than sense.

尤伦叫我们不准靠近那三人
Yoren said none of us were to go near those three.

快过来!  他们吓不倒我
Come here!  They don't scare me.

金袍子来离君临这么远的地方做什么? 
What are Gold Cloaks doing so far from King's Landing?

你干嘛?   他们在找我
What are you doing?  They're looking for me.

你们离家可够远的
You're a long way from home.

尤伦
守夜人 '浪鸦'

我刚问你话呢
I asked you a question.

但是你态度太差 我选择不作答
You asked without manners and I chose not to answer.

我奉王家授权状 要拿你手下的某只阴沟鼠
I have a royal warrant for one of these gutter rats you're transporting.

问题在于
Well, the thing is...

这群阴沟鼠现在是咱守夜人的人了
These gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch.

国王和太后可管不到那么远
Now, that puts them beyond the reach of Kings and Queens.

这可真有趣 人们往往太过注重保护喉咙 结果忽视了来自下方的威胁
It's a funny thing people worry so much about their throats that they forget about what's down low.

这把刀子我早餐之前才刚刚磨过
Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast.

如果我愿意 用来刮蜘蛛屁股上的毛都行 或者 我可以用它割开你腿上的动脉
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to or I could nick this artery in your leg.

割了之后 这附近可没人知道 如何给动脉止血
And once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to unnick it.

这东西咱们就替你保管了
We'll just keep that.

长城上总是需要好钢
Good steel is always needed on the Wall.

看起来你似乎得做个选择 要么死在这个远离家乡的十字路口 要么滚回城 告诉你的头儿 你没找到要找的东西
Seems you have a choice you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home, or you can go back to your city and tell your Masters you didn't find what you were looking for.

我们正在找一个叫詹德利的男孩
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

他带着一顶牛头盔
He carries a bull's head helmet.

谁把他交上来 就能得到国王的赏赐
Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward.

我们还会带着更多的人回来 到时候我要把你的脑袋和那男孩一起带走
We'll be back with more men and I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.

You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.

我们刚刚在谈论您是何等英勇无敌 大败史塔克军
We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.

那可是一场大战
It was quite a battle.

我听说您的脑袋受了重伤哟
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

那群北方人可真是令人生畏的战士
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

我还给他讲了我们相遇的故事
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

关于您是如何在父亲的厨房里 找到这么个尤物的事 我差点就信了
To find so lovely a creature working in your father's kitchens it almost beggars belief.

奇事偶尔也会发生
Strange things do happen.

你该尝尝她的鱼肉'饼'儿
You should taste her fish pie.

我觉得瓦里斯大人不会喜欢吃鱼肉饼的
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

这您怎么知道?  我就是知道
How can you tell?  I can always tell.

瓦里斯大人也好 我也罢 都不喜欢被人提及自身的缺憾
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us.

他肯老老实实帮我把鱼打来就多谢了
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

我很高兴您的新朋友 能陪您一起来王都
I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.

朋友可是生活中不可或缺的重要部分啊
Friends are such an important part of life.

不幸的是您父亲并不希望她来
Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come.

不过大人您别担心
But rest easy, My Lord.

我可是非常擅长为好朋友 保守秘密
I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.

你在对待朋友时的谨慎 我早有耳闻
Your discretion is legendary...  where your friends are concerned.

您看我 明明您很想休息 但我却唠叨个不停
How unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest.

欢迎来到君临 亲爱的
Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.

这座城市因您的到来而蓬荜生辉
This city is made brighter by your presence.

我们还要出席一场御前会议 大人
We have a council meeting, My Lord.

我不喜欢被威胁
I don't like threats.

谁威胁您了?  我可不是奈德·史塔克
Who threatened you?  I'm not Ned Stark.

我了解这游戏的规则
I understand the way this game is played.

奈德·史塔克是个有荣誉心的人
Ned Stark was a man of honor.

再威胁我 我就把你扔进海里去
Threaten me again and I'll have you thrown into the sea.

那样您可能会对结果很失望哟
You might be disappointed in the results.

风暴来复往兮 大鱼吃掉小鱼 而我仍旧是那个弄潮儿
Storms come and go, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling.

我们不该让太后久等
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

'从今以后 直到永远 我们都不再是你们国度的一部分 而是一个自由并且独立的北境王国'
'From this time until the end of time we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent kingdom of the North.'

阿尔顿·兰尼斯特
信使 瑟曦和詹姆的堂弟

他比他父亲更有胆 这点我承认
He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
摄政太后

你的撕纸艺术愈发精湛呐
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.

把他父亲的遗骨还回去吧 至少展示一下诚意
We can give him his father's bones back at least as a gesture of good faith.

你会把我们的回复带给史塔克吧 堂弟? 
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

你在史塔克那里作客时 有没有见到我弟弟? 
Did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest?

他们没能令他屈服 陛下
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

如果你有机会和他说话 告诉他 他没被遗忘
If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.

我会的 陛下  路上小心 堂弟
I will, Your Grace.  Safe travels, cousin.

你可真是颇具政治手腕啊
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

还有别的事吗?   今晨来了只信鸦 有关黑城堡的事务
If that's everything... Aa raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.

关于野人的麻烦? 
Trouble with the wildlings.

这就是为何叫他们'野人'
That's why they're called 'wildlings.'

这帮家伙最近不那么'野'了
Somewhat less wild these days.

似乎停止了自相残杀 并且开始追随这个 塞外之王
Seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this KingBeyondtheWall.

又一个国王? 现在有几个了? 五个? 
Another king?How many is that now, five?

总司令大人向我们索要更多的人手以防守长城
The Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man the Wall.

他大概忘记了我们正在打仗
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.

我们没法给他任何人
We have no men to spare.

冷风已然吹起 复活的死人也随之而来
'The cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them.'

北方人十分迷信
The northerners are a superstitious people.

按总司令的说法 一个死人闯入了他房间 攻击了他
According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers.

你该怎么样杀一个死人? 
How do you kill a dead man?

显然烧了他就行
Apparently you burn him.

你去了趟长城 回来之后 就开始相信古灵精怪了
One trip to the Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks.

我不知道自己相信的是什么 但事实就是 守夜人军队是挡在我们和 长城外那些未知威胁之间的唯一屏障
I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you the Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.

我非常有信心 勇敢的守夜人 会保护我们所有人
I have every confidence that the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

诸神希望我们能有点尊严 所以不希望我们死的时候放屁
'if the Gods wanted us to have dignity, they wouldn't make us fart when we died.'

临死的时候我就那么握着她的手
I was holding her hand when she left this world.

她放的屁如此之大 整个床都晃起来了
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

一个男人有这么多老婆实在是贪心啊
Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives.

两三个还不够吗? 
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

我们正在讨论严肃的话题呢
We were having a serious discussion.

你看什么呢? 
Would you look at that?

没什么比女人走开的样子更吸引人了
Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.

我更想看她们走来的样子
I prefer watching them come towards me.

那样也有看头
I'm sure that's nice, too.

嗯 有个叫做紫罗兰的挤奶女工 她家的农场紧挨着我家
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up.

我们六岁大时就开始摔跤
We were wrestling together from the time we were six years old.

后来我们长大了 摔跤的内容…
And then we got older and the wrestling, uh...

当然是竭尽所能
Well, as many times as I could.

真希望我也是在农场长大的
I wish I grew up on a farm.

我们需要更多的土豆
We need more potatoes.

我要再削一份土豆泥
Get another sack from the sledge.

再来点芜菁吧
Get the turnips, too.

白灵 走开 去 去!
Ghost, away. Shoo, shoo!

他吓着你了吗  你不能碰我的
Did he frighten you? Youyou shouldn't touch me.

我只是想确认你有没有受伤
I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

她是卡斯特的…女儿之一
She's one of Craster's...daughters.

你好 吉莉 你这是干嘛? 
Hello, Gilly.What are you doing?

山姆说你或许能帮上忙
Sam said you could help.

抱歉 山姆也知道我们不能
I'm sorry, but Sam knows we're not supposed

我们必须在走的时候带上她
Have to take her with us when we leave.

那真是  我知道这听起来有点疯狂
What would that I know it sounds a bit mad.

这不是听起来有点疯狂 而是根本不可能
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,it's impossible.

总司令命令我们  我们发誓守护人民
The Lord Commander ordered us to We are sworn to protect.

山姆 我们不能带她走  求你了 大人 我求你
Sam, we can't take please, ser, please.

要跑的时候我绝不会拖后腿
I can still run if I have to.

这根本不可能  我马上要生孩子了
It's just not possible.  I'm going to have a baby.

你想让我们冒生命危险帮你 可又不告诉我们原因
You want us to risk our lives for you and you won't even tell us why?

你为什么要这样?   哪样? 问她问题? 
Why'd you do that?  Do what? Ask her a question?

你太残忍了  残忍!? 
You were cruel.  Cruel?

山姆 你就这么急着想丢掉一只手吗? 
Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

我又没碰她  但你正想要偷她
I didn't touch her.  No, you just want to steal her.

你知道卡斯特为此会切掉你什么吗? 
What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

她是个人 不是山羊
She's a person,not a goat.

我们正在渐渐深入野人的领土
We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory.

我们不能带着一个女孩同行 莫尔蒙不会同意的
We can't take a girl with us.Mormont wouldn't have it.

即使他真的同意 我们该拿她怎么办? 
And even if he would,what would we do with her?

谁为她接生婴儿? 你吗? 
Who's going to deliver a baby, you?

怎么了? 我读过有关的书籍
What?I've read about it.

您无须目睹此事  他是吾血之血
You don't need to see this.  He is blood of my blood.

这是谁干的?   也许是波诺卡奥
Who did this?  Khal Pono, perhaps.

他们可不喜欢一个女人来统领卡拉萨
They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasar.

等我找他们算完帐想必他们会更加讨厌
They will like it far less when I am done with them.

城堡是否仍和您记忆中一致呐 大人?
Is it as you remember,My Lord?

孩子的眼里 所有的东西都要大些
Everything looks bigger when you're a child.

我还记得在我小时候 我觉得父亲的船舱大得像座宫殿
I remember my father's cabin felt like a palace when I was little.

他们会在码头上等我
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

今天对他们来说可是个大日子
This is a big day for them.

我离开之后他们便没什么值得兴奋的事
They haven't had much to get excited about since I left.

铁群岛是个严苛艰难之地
It's a hard place,the Iron Islands.

如此湿冷
It's cold and it's wet.

啊 我爱这湿冷
Oh, I love the cold and wet.

人们说艰苦的地方养育出坚毅的人
They say hard places breed hard men.

坚毅的人统治这个世界
And hard men rule the world.

兴许不久之后您就会成为国王
Then you'll be king before long.

笑的时候闭上嘴巴
Try smiling with your lips closed.

我父亲不信任你们铁民
My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

他说你们是掠夺者和强奸犯 不管你们拥有多少女人 你们永远不会满
He says that you're all reavers and rapers and that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be sat!

别提你父亲了
Quit talking about your father.

他对我们的看法正确得很呐
But he's right about us.

我们铁群岛的'岩妻'只负责给男人生儿育女
Our wives from the Iron Islands,they're for breeding.

这无法使我们满足
That's not enough for us.

所以我们从那些抢来的女人里边 挑选'盐妾'
That's why we take salt wives the women we capture.

我可以同您一齐上岸
Take me with you when you go ashore.

让我成为您的盐妾  你该待在这船上
Make me your salt wife.  Your place is on this ship.

父亲会惩罚我
Father will punish me.

他会责骂我是个妓女
He'll call me a whore.

她连碰都没让我碰
I barely touched her.

而我付的买春钱却是寻常妓院的两倍 我得到了什么? 一直在哭!
Now, you charge twice as much as every other brothel and this is what I getcrying.

稍等片刻 我的朋友 稍等
One moment, my friend.A moment.

请务必接受我最诚挚的歉意
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

兰卡会伺候好您的
Aremca will take good care of you.

抱歉 大人  嘘 嘘
I'm sorry, My Lord.  Shh, shh.

她就是那个 金袍子 杀了她的孩子  啊 是的
She's the onethe Gold Cloaks, they killed her baby.  Ah, yes.

这事… 处理得太轻率了
That was...  poorly handled.

往往 那些权倾天下的贵胄 是最没仁慈之心的
Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.

我总是情不自禁想起这事
I can't stop thinking about it.

她那可怜的孩子
That poor little baby.

你知道吗? 你让我想起另一个姑娘 我曾经在某个极乐之地 所得的尤物 美丽动人 就像你 而且 也聪明如你
You know, you remind me of another girl, a lovely thing I once acquired from a Lysene pleasure house beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent,like yourself.

但她并不快乐
But she wasn't happy.

我问她缘由 但我和她 并不像现在你我这般相处融洽
I asked her why,but we didn't have the kind of rapportthat you and I have.

是啊 真让人悲伤遗憾
Yes, it was quite sad.

从那些地方来的女孩总是昂贵 极其昂贵
Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses are expensive, extremely expensive.

而她没能为我带来任何收入
And this one wasn't making me any money.

我讨厌失败的投资
I hate bad investments.

我不知如何使她开心 也不知如何减轻我的损失
I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses.

一位腰缠万贯的恩客 他给了我 极其可观的一笔钱 来让他好好调教一番这女孩
A very wealthy patron,he offered me a tremendousamount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl.

用那些大部分男人
To use her in ways that...

也从未见识过的方法
Would never occur to most men.

而此类方法 相信你并不陌生
And you know what occurs to most men.

我说不准最后他是否让她开心了起来 但我的损失可是切切实实地减轻了
I would not say he succeeded in making her happy, but my losses were definitely mitigated.

今晚休息吧 为梅玵的孩子哀悼
Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.

明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

该死 小子!  抱歉 大人
Damn it, boy!  Apologies, My Lord.

退下吧 波德瑞克 倒酒我们尚能自己动手
Leave us, Podrick. I believe weknow how to pour our own wine.

这就是你的新侍从? 
That's your new squire?

我可以给你找个更体面的小子
I could've found you a proper lad.

我嘛 更喜欢不那么体面的人
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

嗯 红酒不错 产自多恩? 
Mm, that's a good red.Dornish?

看来您是懂酒的人 大人
You know your wines,My Lord.

豪华的宴席 大人
A fine dinner, My Lord.

叫我提利昂就好了
Call me Tyrion, please.

如今你也是位大人了 想必你已习惯这等大餐
I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

也许我会雇佣您手下这位厨师
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

算了吧 比这还微不足道的小事都能引发战争
Wars have been started for less.

我听说某天夜里 小指头的妓院遇到了不小的麻烦
I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

但必须完成  对 当然
Had to be done.  Yes, of course.

都城守备队必须维持治安 只不过我没意识到维持治安还需要屠杀婴儿
The City Watch must keep the peace, only I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.

上意难违  非常正确
Orders are orders.  Quite right.

尤其是太后之命
Especially the queen's orders.

我从未说过是太后下的命令
I never said they were the queen's orders.

嗯 不过还有谁想要杀光劳勃国王的私生子呢? 
No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards?

她一直是个善妒之人
She's always been a jealous woman.

你比我更了解你姐姐
You know your sister better than I do.

你听过那些关于我老哥老姐可怕的流言吗? 
You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister?

我不信那些污言秽语
I don't listen to filth.

那很好 不过你听过
That's good of you,but you have heard them.

我认为还是有人会信这套 认为劳勃的私生子比瑟曦的孩子更有资格继承铁王座
I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.

乔佛里是我的国王 其余的我都没兴趣
Joffrey is my king.The rest doesn't interest me.

我感激你的忠诚
I appreciate your loyalty.

告诉我 当你的手下在王座厅 屠杀奈德·史塔克的人的时候 可是你下的命令? 
Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room,did you give the order?

那家伙是叛徒
The man was a traitor.

他想收买我的忠诚
He tried to buy my loyalty.

他压根不知道你已经被收买了
He had no idea you were already bought.

我不能接受被一个小恶魔质疑我的荣誉
I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp!

我可不是在质疑你的荣誉 杰诺斯大人
I'm not questioning Your Honor, Lord Janos.

我认为你根本没有荣誉可言
I'm denying its existence.

如果你认为我会在这老老实实受你的羞辱 侏儒
If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf

侏儒? 你说小恶魔就已经很过分了 不要得寸进尺
Dwarf? Mm, you should have stopped at Imp.

而且 是的 你就要在这接受羞辱 除非你想被我的朋友们'羞辱'
And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.

在我父亲从战场回来以前 我都将代行首相之职
I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war.

而鉴于你背叛了上一任首相 哎 我实在对你在身旁不安心呐
And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.

你算老几 咱上头的朋友可不会允许你这样对我的!
What are you t my friends at court will not allow this!

太后已经答应我  是'摄政'太后
The queen herself has granted...  The queen regent.

而且你也够傻 竟然以为她是你朋友
And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.

那我们就听听乔佛里陛下是怎么说的吧
We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.

今晚就有条船启程去东海望
There's a ship leaving for EastwatchbytheSea tonight.

从这到黑城堡 恐怕可是趟漫漫旅途呐
From there I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.

我希望你会喜欢上长城的
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

我发现它有种很特别的美
I found it surprisingly beautiful...

我看过许多场战斗

我看见一个人直接对别人捅刀子 在跳蚤窝里的一间酒馆外
I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

直接捅在右脖子上

两个人打架可算不上一场战斗
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

他们可穿了盔甲啊  那又如何? 
They had armor on.  So?

他们穿了盔甲 那就是战斗
So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.

一个染坊小子又懂得啥叫战斗? 
What does a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?

詹德利是个铁匠学徒哦
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

热派 告诉詹德利怎么才是战斗
Hot pie, tell Gendry what makes a fight into a battle.

当他们穿起盔甲就是了
It's, um, when they've got armor on.

你怎么知道他是个骑士? 
How'd you know he was a knight?

呃 他们穿了盔甲啊
Well, it was 'cause he got armor on.

You don't have to be a knight to have armor.

任何傻瓜都能买盔甲
Any idiot can buy armor.

金袍子为什么要找你? 
What do the Gold Cloaks want with you?

我不知道   骗人
No idea. You're a liar.

你可不该冒犯比你强壮的人
You know, you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.

那我可就没人可冒犯咯
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

鬼知道他们抓我干嘛 我才不在意呢
I don't care what any of them want.

但那些问我问题的人都没好下场
No good's ever come of their questions.

都有谁问过你问题? 
Who asked questions before?

你这小人精还真是麻烦呢
How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?

首相
The Hand of the King.

艾林大人第一个 结果几星期后他就死了 接着是史塔克大人 几星期后他也丢了脑袋
Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died, and then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died.

看见没? 问我问题的都没好下场
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

估计你也快了
You'll probably be dead soon.

他们都问了你些啥?   关于我妈
What did they ask about?   My mom.

你妈是谁?   就是我妈啊 在旅店工作 我小时候她就死了
Who's your mom?   Just my mom worked in a tavern, died when I was little.

那你爹呢? 
And who was your father?

不清楚 让我说搞不好就是某个混蛋金袍子咧
Could've been one of those goldhatted bastards, for all I know.

那你那又是咋回事? 
What about you anyway?

你一直以为他们是来抓你的吧
You thought they were after you.

是因为你杀了人?  还是因为你是个女孩? 
Did you kill someone or is it just because you're a girl?

我不是女孩!  你就是
I'm not a girl. Yes, you are.

你以为我跟他们一样笨吗? 
Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?

守夜人不收女孩 这事谁都知道
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.

这倒是 不过你还是个女孩

我又不用撒尿
I don't need to take a piss.

那 不许告诉罗米和热派
Lommy and hot pie can't know.

他们不会从我这里知道
Well, they won't,not from me.

我是史塔克家族的艾莉亚
It's Arya...of House Stark.

尤伦这是带我回临冬城
Yoren is taking me hometo Winterfell.

他是你爹 那个首相 那个叛徒
He was your fatherthe Hand, the traitor.

他才不是叛徒
He was never a traitor.

所以你出身高贵 那你就是位淑女啦  不
So you're a highborn, then.You're a lady.

我母亲才是位淑女 还有我姐姐
My mother was a ladyand my sister

你是大贵族的女儿啊 住在城堡里面 天哪 那些关于鸡鸡的 我不该说那些话的 还有我在你面前撒尿 这些事情
Yeah, but you werea lord's daughter and you livedin a castle and you look, all that about cocks,I should never have said and I've been pissingin front of you and everything.

我该叫您我的小姐
II should becalling you 'My Lady.'

别叫我小姐  就照小姐吩咐
Do not call me 'My Lady.'As My Lady commands.

你这算哪门子的老爷千金啊
Well, that was unladylike.

梨子和橘子 青亭岛的葡萄酒
Myrish oranges, wine from the Arbor...

还有派克城铁群岛的继承人
And the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.

巴隆·葛雷乔伊唯一活着的儿子
The only living sonof Balon Greyjoy.

我要去派克城
I need to get to Pyke.

我会给你找匹马
I'll find you a horse.

我恰好顺路 我能带你去
I'm heading that way.I can take you there.

你出海很久了? 
Have you been at sea long?

还是你来的地方就没有女人? 
Or were there just no women where you came from?

没有像你这样的  你可不知道我是哪样的人
None like you.You don't know what I'm like.

没准你也不知道自己是哪样的人
Maybe you don't know what you're like.

没准你需要有人好好调教一下
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

你知道我是谁吗? 
Do you know who I am?

你以为随便什么有钱人都能白坐我的马背吗
You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry,

把我的东西送到城堡去

你该让我来骑

我比你技术好多了
I'm a better rider than you.

过去九年 我可是人不离鞍呐
I've been on horseback for the past nine years.

你还记得多少驾船之术? 
Do you still know your way around a ship?

这双手可有碰过缆绳?

如果我不看路 这血脉可就要回归大海了
Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.

我有个好提议带给我父亲 一个可以令他再次称王的提议 而我 就是他的继承人
I have a proposal for my father, one that will make him king again, and me after him.

够幸运的话 你今晚没准能留在城堡里
You may get to stay in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

这是我们未来的国王的邀请吗? 
Is that an offer from my future king?

是你未来国王的命令
An order from your future king.

你以后可以给子孙们讲述今晚的故事了
You can tell your grandchildren about this night.

我可不觉得这会是个适合小孩子的故事

What have they given back?

您的亲生骨肉 您的继承人  这我可不敢确定
Your blood and your heir.We shall see.

史塔克养你的时间可比我长
Stark had you longer than I did.

那你对他的事怎么看? 
And how do you feel about that?

我为你带来了罗柏·史塔克的提议
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

谁教你穿成这样? 
Who gave you those clothes?

奈德·史塔克喜欢你穿成这样 好当他的乖女儿? 
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?

如果你不喜欢我的衣服 我换就是
If my clothes offend you,I will change them.

你脖子上带的东西 是用金子还是用铁钱换来的? 
That bauble'round your neck did you pay the iron pricefor it or the gold?

你是从亲手杀死的敌人尸体上扯下来的 还是花钱买来配你这身美丽衣服的? 
Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

我绝不准我儿子打扮的像个婊子
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

果然不出我所料 史塔克家已经把你变成跟他们一个样
My fears have come true the Starks have made you theirs.

我仍是盐与铁的血脉
My blood is salt and iron.

是吗 史塔克家的小子不是把你当成训练有素的信鸦 让你乖乖替他送信了吗
Yet the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message.

他开的条件是我提议的
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

他需要你的忠告? 
He heeds your counsel?

我和他一起生活 一起打猎 并肩作战
I've lived with him,hunted with him,fought at his side.

他把我当成兄弟一般
He thinks of me as a brother.

住口! 不准你在这里胡扯
No, not here,not in my hearing.

在我面前说你是他的'兄弟' 你真正的哥哥就是被此人父亲所杀害
You will not name him brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.

难道你忘了你的血亲兄弟? 
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

我记得我的亲生哥哥
I remember my brothers.

我还记得 我的父亲原本是个国王
And I remember when my father was a king.

我帮罗柏·史塔克除掉敌人 而他让我再次成为铁群岛之王
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again.

我将亲自带兵出击  哦 是吗? 
I will lead the attack myself.Oh, you will?

我是你的儿子 你唯一的继承人
I'm your son,your only living heir.

我吩咐过你在外面等着
I told you to wait outside.

你怎么避开守卫的? 
How did you get past the guards?

带把儿的都挺好骗
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

很高兴见到你 弟弟
So good to see you,brother.

这才是我以后要讲给子孙的故事
This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.

她哪里能打仗!
She can't lead an attack!

为什么不能呢?   你只是个女人!
And why not?  You're a woman!

穿着裙子的可是你  这里可不是临冬城 孩子
You're the one in skirts.  This isn't Winterfell, boy.

你哥哥被你的新爸爸杀死之后 你姐姐就接掌了他的船
Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.

逝者不死
What's dead may never die.

每个夜晚 她不是在岛上 就是在海上度过
The only nights she's spent off these islands have been spent on the sea.

她清楚自己是谁
She knows who she is.

我不需任何人施舍我王冠
No man gives me a crown.

我付铁钱
I pay the iron price.

亲自夺取 这才是我的铁种本性
I will take my crown, for that is who I am.

这才是我们的古道传统
That is who we have always been.

面对兰尼斯特大军你根本毫无机会
You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.

谁说这跟兰尼斯特有关了? 
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

当我们夺下君临的国库 你就可以取走你的酬劳
You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

在所有争夺铁王座的国王中 史坦尼斯的军队最微不足道
All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army.

我为何要下这么没把握的赌注呢? 
Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?

因为你是个精明的赌徒
Because you're a smart gambler.

史坦尼斯曾两次在战争中证明自己
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

而他那小弟弟甚至都没上过战场
His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield.

当然 僭王乔佛里也没有
Neither has the false King Joffrey.

那又如何 他们都拥有庞大的军队
And yet they both have larger armies.

史坦尼斯才刚开始集结军队
Stannis has just begun the fight.

他的封臣已经准备好响应号召
His Bannermen will rally to his cause.

七国上下 没人比史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩更有荣誉 也没人比他更值得效忠
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon or more worthy of loyalty.

这世界究竟怎么了 竟需要走私贩来担保国王的荣誉? 
What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings?

注意你的言辞 海盗  马索斯
Mind your words, pirate.  Matthos.

你觉得我被羞辱了? 
You think I'm insulted?

我就是个海盗 而且还是个优秀的海盗
I am a pirate.I'm an excellent pirate.

我不会为了空口许诺而出航
I don't sail for promises.

每次你离开港口 你都是为了一个承诺 大海会给你承诺 大海中总有人在某处揣着金子等你去抢
Every time you leave harbor,you're leaving on a promise a promise that somewhere on the sea, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from him.

这可是个从不食言的承诺  我的承诺也是如此
That's a promise that always comes true.As is mine.

萨拉多 你阅历丰富
You're not a young man,Salladhor.

如果我说错了 还请你指出 大多数的海盗从不成长
And correct me if I'm wrong most pirates don't grow old.

除了个别聪明的
Only the clever ones.

你想把你海盗生涯的最后几年 耗在抢潘托斯乳酪商 和弥林丝绸贩子这些事上? 
You want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Meereenese silk merchants?

那就走吧 他们在海上等着你
Then go.They're out there waiting for you.

而我向你提议的可不简单
What I'm offering you is hard.

跟我来 去劫掠维斯特洛最大的城市
Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros.

你会成为全里斯最出名最富有的人
You'll be the richest man in Lys and the most famous.

你的光辉事迹会被人们世代传颂
They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.

'萨拉多·桑恩'真是太适合写在歌谣里了了
'Salladhor Saan' is a good name for songs.

可不是嘛  有个条件 我要太后
It is.  One thingI want the queen.

太后?   瑟曦 我想要她
The queen?   CerseiI want her.

我所有的三十艘船会跟着你的舰队出发
I'll sail with your fleet,all 30 of my ships.

如果它们没有沉进黑水湾的话
And if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay,

我可要好好地操那个金发太后 狠狠地操
I will fuck this blonde queen and I'll fuck her well.

这场战争不是为了你
This war isn't about you.

我们打君临城不是为了让你强奸太后的
We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.

谁说要去强奸她了 我要去操她
I'm not going to rape her.I'm going to fuck her.

就好像她会愿意似的
As if she would just let you.

在这种事情上我可是自有一套哟
You don't know how persuasive I am.

你要不要来试试呢
I've never tried to fuck you.

史坦尼斯是唯一合法的国王 而光之王是唯一的真神
Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light, the one true God

小子 我曾经行遍世界各地 任何我到过的地方 人们都告诉我真神的故事
I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go,people tell me about the true Gods.

他们都以为自己找到了对的那个
They all think they found the right one.

但世上唯一的真神是女人两腿间的那个玩意儿 太后两腿间的那个更真一些
The one true God is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet,a queen's legs.

我从没想过你还有个这么虔诚的儿子
I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.

我保证你会拿到金子 赢得荣耀
I promise you the gold.I promise you the glory.

但我不能承诺给你太后
I cannot promise you the queen.

你对你的国王就这么有把握? 
You believe your king can win?

他是唯一真正的国王
He is the one true king.

你们维斯特洛人真有意思
You Westerosi are funny people.

那家伙砍掉了你的手指 然后你就爱上了他
A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him.

戴佛斯·席渥斯 我会和你一起出航
I'll sail with you,Davos Seaworth.

你是我见过最正直的走私贩
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

带我到君临城门 我会的
Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.

国王什么时候起航? 
When will the king have us sail?

待神谕降临之时
As soon as his God wills it.

那也是你我的神 但你太盲目 不能认清这一点
He's my God, too,and yours, but you are too blind to see.

我来教你念书吧  噢 你和你妈一个德行
Let me teach you how to read.   Oh, you and your mother.

不会花很长时间的 你已经认识字母了
It won't take long.You already know the letters.

圣书比我有说服力多了
The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.

我真心希望自己也能有个神来崇拜
I wish I had a God, truly.

不是嘲笑你 但我见过人们对着每一个他们知道的神祈祷 祈祷风调雨顺 祈祷平安归家
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is pray for wind, pray for rain,pray for home.

但从来没有管用过  可你总能平安归来啊
None of it works.   But you always came home.

我从不祈祷 但我会
I wasn't praying.   No, but I was.

你出海的那些夜晚
Every night that you were at sea,

我总会点起蜡烛为你祈祷
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

你想我信神
You want me to have a God?

那好吧 史坦尼斯国王就是我的神
Fine. King Stannis is my God.

他提拔我 他的信任护佑着我
He raised me up and blessed me with his trust.

他许给你的未来 远超我的想象
He gave you a future I could never have imagined.

你读书识字 将来还可能成为一个骑士
You know how to read. You'll be a knight someday.

难道这些都是你的火神下的令吗? 
You think a fire God commanded all that?

是史坦尼斯 全都是史坦尼斯
It was Stannis,only Stannis.

史坦尼斯是我的国王 但他只是一介凡人
Stannis is my king,but he's only a man.

杰诺斯·史林特大人是都城守备队的队长
Lord Janos Slynt was commander of the City Watch.

你没有权力驱逐他
You had no right to exile him.

我怎么没有权力 我是御前首相
I have every right.I am the King's Hand.

你只不过是暂代父亲行首相一职
You're serving as the King's Hand till father gets here.

听我说 摄政太后
Listen to me,Queen Regent.

你正在失去民心
You're losing the people.

你听到我说的话了吗?   哈 民心
Do you hear me? The people.

等到成千上万的民众都想你死的时候 统治起来就没那么容易了
You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.

凛冬来时 半个城市闹着饥荒
Half the city will starve when winter comes.

另一半则会谋划推翻你的统治
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

而金袍子刚刚给了他们 最响亮的抗争口号
And your goldplated thugs just gave them their rallying cry

你甚至连否认一下的表面功夫都不做
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

不是你下的命令 对吗? 
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

乔佛里甚至没告诉你
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

那样就更糟糕了
I imagine that would be even worse.

他只是做了该做的事
He did what needed to be done.

你想做御前首相? 你想统治国家? 
You want to be Hand of the King?You want to rule?

躺在一张长满野草的床上 在睡梦中被勒死之前将它们连根拔起 这就叫做统治
This is what ruling is lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root, one by one, before they strangle you in your sleep.

我不是国王 但我认为统治可比这复杂多了
I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that.

我才不管你是怎么想的
I don't care what you think!

你从来就没认真过
You've never taken it seriously.

你没有 詹姆也没有
You haven't,Jaime hasn't.

结果重担全压我身上了
It's all fallen on me.

正如詹姆老压在你身上 就像史坦尼斯说的
As has Jaime repeatedly,according to Stannis Baratheon.

你从来都很可笑
You've always been funny...

但是没有哪个笑话比得上你人生第一个笑话 对吗? 
But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they?

你为了来到人世间而扯开我母亲的肚子 她因为失血过多而死
Back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death?

她也是我母亲
She was my mother, too.

世间再没比这更可笑的事情了
There's no bigger joke in the world than that.

陛下  陛下
Your Grace.   Your Grace.

和你的海盗朋友谈妥了吗? 
How did you fare with your pirate?

萨拉多·桑恩将加入我们的舰队
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet

三十艘船 外加一批精兵强将
30 ships.His men know how to fight.

依我来看 海盗只应付得了散兵游勇
In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

眼下别无选择
It does seem the wiser choice.

这次不再是选择了
There won't be a choice this time.

萨拉多·桑恩是我的老朋友
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.

我俩认识有三十个年头了
I've known him 30 years.

我从没信任过他 但是只要给他钱 他就不会反悔
I've never trusted him, but once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops.

若他尽职 酬劳就是应得的
Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.

光之王护佑着你 年轻的战士
The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.

你跟他说了些什么? 
What did you say to him?

我告诉他浴火是最圣洁的死亡
I told him death by fire is the purest death.

为什么?   因为事实就是如此
Why? Because it is true.

陛下 你很焦虑
You're troubled, my king.

对光之王而言 这些军队不过些玩具
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.

那就让你的神烧了他们
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

我祈求他的指引并执行
I pray for his commands and I obey.

据斥候说 我弟弟有十万大军 他们本该效忠于我
My little brother has 100,000 men according to the scouts, men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

在实战中 十次里有九次都是 人数占优的一方获胜
In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of 10.

那我们就是那第十次
Then we must be the 10th.

在战场上 我无法战胜我弟弟
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

而不把那些他窃取的兵力夺回来 我根本拿不下君临
And I can't take King's Landing without the men he's stolen.

我在火焰中看见了通向胜利之路
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.

但首先 你要把自己献给光之王
But first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.

见鬼 那些我都说了
I've said the words,damn you.

你必须献出你的全部
You must give all of yourself.

她病了 很虚弱
She's sickly, weak...

独居在高塔里
Shut away in a tower.

而且她什么也没给你 没有儿子 只有死婴 只有死亡
And she's given you nothing no sons,only stillborns, only death.

而我将给你一个儿子 我的陛下
I will give you a son, my king.

这杂种摸进了他不该去的地方!
Bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!

我命令你带上全部人马 给我滚
I want you and your men gone.

立即执行
And you will make this right.

总司令大人  出去!
Lord Commander.  Now!

总司令大人  退下
Lord Commander.  Leave us.

他把新生儿抱进树林
He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.

那关你什么事? 
What business is that of yours?

您不明白
No, you don't understand.

他杀掉了所有的男孩
He's killing them, all the boys.

野人侍奉更残暴的神祗
The wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I.

那些男婴 是卡斯特的祭品
Those boys are Craster's offerings.

他谋杀亲子 简直就是禽兽
He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.

是啊 可是那禽兽曾多次 救我们游骑兵于生死之间
Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our Rangers.

包括你叔叔在内
Your Uncle among them.

我们还有别的仗要打
We have other wars to fight out there.

不管你看不看得惯 我们都需要卡斯特这种人
Like it or not, we need men like Craster.

有什么东西抱走了那婴儿
Something take that child.

我敢说你还会见到它
I daresay you'll see it again.

我 我一直想送你点什么
II wanted to give you something.

这是我母亲的
It belonged to my mother.

我不能收  拜托了
I can't take it.  Please.

我母亲从前用它做针线活
My mother used it for sewing.

每次她都让我坐在身边 念书给她听
She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her.

父亲发现后严令禁止了
My father put a stop to it when he found out.

我只有这一件她的东西了
It's the only thing I have of hers.

还是在我离家来长城前 她送给我的
She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

你 你不该随便送人
You you shouldn't give it away.

我没有随便送人
I'm not giving it away.

是送给你
I'm giving it to you.

叫醒布兰 好吗? 该上课了
Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.

每晚都是如此
Every night it's the same.

我在梦中行走 奔跑 但是
I'm walking and running, but...

我穿梭于神木林 嗅闻泥土 捕猎杀戮 口尝鲜血 放声长啸
I'm running through the Godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling.

老奶妈给我讲过故事 故事里有魔力的人 他们能进入鹿 鸟 狼的体内
Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.

布兰 那些只是 故事罢了  那么老奶妈是骗人了? 
That's exactly what they are, Bran stories.  So she was lying?

他们不存在?   怎么说呢 他们或许曾经存在
They don't exist?  Well, they may have done.

但和很多神奇的事情一样 早已从这个世界消失
But they're gone from the world along with much else.

这些只是梦境 布兰 仅此而已
These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.

不 我的梦是特别的
No, my dreams are different.

我梦见过父亲的死亡
I dreamt of my father dying.

瑞肯也做过同样的梦
And Rickon had the same dream.

不还有些梦没成真吗? 
What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true?

这一环由瓦雷利亚钢铸造
This link is made of Valyrian steel.

只有百分之一的学士有资格佩戴
Only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain.

它代表我进修过'高级神秘术'
It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.

所有学习高级神秘术的人 都忍不住想尝试施法
And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.

哪个孩子没幻想过拥有超常的力量 从此便不同凡响? 
And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one?

但最终 和之前的无数孩子一样
But in the end, for all my efforts,

无论我如何努力 也毫无效果
I got no more out of it than 1,000 boys before me.

或许魔法曾是一种伟大的力量
Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.

巨龙消失了
The Dragons are gone.

森林之子也已被人遗忘
And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

打得漂亮 请上前
Well fought. Approach.

请起 摘下头盔
Rise. Remove your helm.

你父亲对你并未夸大其词 小姐
You are all your father promised and more, My Lady.

我只见洛拉斯爵士被打落过一两次 而且绝没有如此难堪
I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.

不 不 亲爱的 我哥哥相当勇猛
Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.

没错 我的王后
That he did, my Queen.

但冠军只能有一个
But there can only be one champion.

塔斯的布蕾妮 你可以向我索要任何东西
Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire.

只要我力所能及 便如你所愿
If it is within my power, it is yours.

我恳请获得御林铁卫的荣誉职位
I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

我愿成为你七卫之一 为您献出我的生命 保护您免遭一切危难
I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.

请起 御林铁卫 布蕾妮
Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

陛下 我很荣幸地为您带来凯特琳·史塔克夫人 她是她儿子临冬城主罗柏·史塔克的信使
Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.

临冬城主和北境之王
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

凯特琳夫人 欢迎之至
Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.

请允许我介绍我的妻子 提利尔家族的玛格丽
May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell?

非常欢迎您 史塔克夫人
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

对您丈夫的遭遇我深感遗憾
I'm so sorry for your loss.

我向您起誓 兰尼斯特将为谋害您的丈夫付出代价
I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder.

一旦我拿下君临
When I take King's Landing,

即刻把乔佛里的人头交给您
I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

听到您愿意伸张正义 我已心满意足了 大人
It will be enough to know that justice was done, My Lord.

而且你应当在国王面前跪下
And you should kneel when you approach the King.

无需如此 史塔克夫人是贵客
There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.

您儿子是否已向泰温·兰尼斯特进军? 
Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?

我并未列席我儿子的作战会议
I do not sit on my son's war councils.

就算我出席 也不会将他的部署透露给您
And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.

如果罗柏·史塔克想谈判 应该亲自前来 而不是躲在母亲身后
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.

我儿子正对战强敌 而非比武作乐
My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.

不必多虑 夫人
Don't worry, My Lady.

战争才刚刚开始
Our war is just beginning.

脚怎么样了?   好多了 陛下
How's your foot?  Better, Your Grace.

这些家伙根本不知轻重
They don't know their own size is all.

我帐下有十万大军
I have 100,000 men at my command.

这是风暴地和河湾地的全部战力
All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.

全都和您的百花骑士一样年轻气盛? 
And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers?

这对您来说 只是一场游戏 对吗? 
It's a game to you, isn't it?

因为这不会久长
Because it won't last.

因为他们是夏天的骑士 而凛冬将至
Because they are the Knights of summer and winter is coming.

布蕾妮 护送凯特琳夫人回营帐
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

她旅途劳顿  遵命 陛下
She's tired from her journey.  At once, Your Grace.

之后我还需要回来吗?   不用
Shall I return after?  That won't be necessary.

我要祈祷一会儿 独自一人
I would pray awhile.Alone.

请跟我来 夫人
If you'll follow me, My Lady.

您今天作战非常勇猛 布蕾妮小姐
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

我为我的国王而战
I fought for my King.

不久我便会为他走上战场
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

需要时为他献出生命
Die for him if I must.

而且 如果您不介意 叫我布蕾妮就可以了
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

你来做什么? 
What are you doing here?

生我的气了 弟弟?   你这个说谎的婊子
Are you angry with me, brother? You lying bitch.

不是我的错  是你自己没认出我
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

认出你?   怎么可能? 
Recognize you? How could I?

我最后一次见你…
The last time I saw you...

你看起来还像个胖小子
You looked like a fat little boy.

你那时也是个胖小子 但我还是认出你了
You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.

为什么不早告诉我? 
Why didn't you tell me?

我打算先瞧瞧你现在是什么德行
I wanted to see who you were first.

我把一切都计划好了 你们只需留心听命便行
The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

狼崽子已经向南方进军 背后跟随着整个北方的兵力
The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the northern army at his back.

他在西境与狮子纠缠时 北境唾手可得
While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the north is ripe for the taking.

铁种将遵从古道 在北境西海岸展开掠夺
The Ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days all along the northern coast.

之后将势力扩展到整片青绿之地 把颈泽 以及整个北境握在手中
We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above.

所有城池将一座接一座投降
Every stronghold will yield to us one by one.

临冬城或许能坚守个一年半载 但那又怎样? 
Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?

剩下的地盘都是我们的了 森林 田野和厅堂
The rest shall be ours forest, field and hall.

亚拉 我的女儿 你将率领三十条长船 攻击深林堡
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte.

我早想要座城堡啦
I've always wanted a castle.

那我的任务呢? 
And what's my role in all this?

你带一条船 袭击磐石海岸 掠夺沿海渔村
You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

你给了她三十条 只给我一条? 
You give her 30 and I get one?

海婊子号 我们认为她很适合你
The sea bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.

让我和渔民作战? 
I'm to fight fishermen?

小心他们的渔网
Be careful of their nets.

父亲 我曾和罗柏·史塔克并肩作战 我了解他的部下
Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men.

他不会轻易放弃北境的
He won't give up the North so easily.

在我们夺下北境之前 他们甚至都不会觉察
They won't even know we're there until it's too late.

你懂什么战争 女人? 
What do you know of it, woman?

我是身经百战的勇士
I'm a proven warrior.

你的两个哥哥才是勇士 可惜都死在你费尽心机袒护的人手里
Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.

我没袒护任何人
I'm not protecting anyone.

我只是在想 此时稍作等待 是否更为明智
I just wonder  if it's not wiser to wait.

北境完全有可能成为我们的盟友 为何要冒险与他们为敌? 
Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?

与他们开战 很可能会让我们全军覆没
Rise up against them and they could destroy us.

但如果我们宣誓效忠 他们会把凯岩城给我们
But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.

不是臣民 不做奴隶
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

不是田野里的耕牛 矿场里的苦力
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.

我们夺取所有应该属于我们的东西
We take what is ours.

你和狼崽子在一起太久 变得懦弱了
Your time with the wolves has made you weak.

说得像是我自愿去当养子
You act as if I volunteered to go.

如果你记性够好 应该记得是你自己送走了我
You gave me away, if you remember.

就在劳勃·拜拉席恩率军将你击溃
The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.

你向他屈膝投降的那一天
After he crushed you.

那时你有没有强取啊? 
Did you take what was yours then?

就像是送走一条你不想要的狗
You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.

现在我回来了 你反而咒骂我
And now you curse me because I've come home.

你想让父亲向你的另一个小家庭臣服? 
You'd have our father bow down to your other family?

我没有另一个家庭
I have no other family.

赶快做决定吧 席恩
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

有你没你 我们都一样出航
Our ships sail with or without you.

你不让我出这间屋子
You won't let me leave this room.

也不让我  嘘 嘘 小声点
You won't let me Shh, shh, keep your voice down.

为什么? 你觉得你的父亲能听见吗? 
Why? You think your father can hear me?

我没想把你困在这儿
I don't intend for you to stay here.

也许我可以让你混进城堡的厨房
I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.

当然 也只是暂时而已
Again, only temporary.

每一个尝过我厨艺的人都说 我是个货真价实的妓女
Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.

不是让你去做厨娘
But you wouldn't be a cook.

是让你去做帮厨
You'd pose as a scullion.

帮厨?  帮厨是什么? 
Scullion? What is a scullion?

洗碗小妹?   是的 不过
A kitchen wench?  Yes, but

我的小狮子想看我这个样子? 
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

你的小狮子想让你活下去
Your lion wants to see you alive.

我们来到了一个危险的地方
We've come to a dangerous place.

我的姐姐想害我
My sister wants to hurt me.

她会努力寻找一切弱点下手
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

她不能知道你的存在
She can't know about you.

这是个恭维呢 小姐
It's a compliment, My Lady.

成为弱点怎么是恭维? 
How is being a weakness a compliment?

在这里说话需要点艺术嘛
Language can be a bit tricky here.

噢 我太笨了 无法理解
Oh, I'm too stupid to understand.

笨笨的异域女孩
The stupid foreign girl.

我不做洗碗小妹
I am not a kitchen wench.

乔佛里和珊莎什么时候结婚? 
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

很快 亲爱的 等到战争结束
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

母亲说我会有新裙子 一条参加婚礼 一条参加宴会
Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast.

但只有你能穿象牙白的裙子 因为你是新娘子
But yours will be ivory since you're the bride.

公主在和你说话呢
The Princess just spoke to you.

我相信你的新裙子会很漂亮的 弥赛菈
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

我会数着日子 期盼战争结束 之后我会在七神面前献上我对国王的爱
I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the Gods.

乔佛里会杀了珊莎的哥哥吗? 
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

不 我不希望
No. I don't think so.

哪怕他这样做 珊莎也会依约成婚
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

对吧 小白鸽? 
Won't you, little dove?

我是雪伊 小姐 您的新侍女
I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

我并不知道我招了一名新侍女
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

你不是本地人  不是
You're not from here. No.

等着您告诉我需要做什么
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

我不需要告诉你该去做什么
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.

你直接去做就好了
You should just do them.

换床单 洗衣服 擦地 倒便壶 梳头
Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

不是这样  您说让我梳
No. You said to brush

您的便壶是空的
Your chamber pot is empty.

你以前做过侍女吗? 
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

朱瑞芙夫人  朱瑞芙夫人? 
Lady Zuriff. Lady Zuriff?

这城里没有叫朱瑞芙夫人的
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

她不在这座城里
She wasn't in this city.

好吧 我不知道侍女在你那座城里怎样工作 但是在这里 侍女要把工作都提前做好 主人不会等待侍女
Well, I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around.

而且我也没有时间回答一千零一问 或者指导你该怎样工作
And I don't have time to answer 1,000 questions and teach you how to do your job.

您希望我退下吗? 
Do you want me to leave?

我已经六天没顺顺当当地大便了
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

我以前也犯过便秘 大人
I've encountered this problem before, My Lord.

重权在肩 难免身体抱恙
The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect.

每天和水服用两滴
Two drops with water daily.

好的 真高兴身边有您这样 博学多闻的人
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.

请坐  谢谢 大人
Please. Thank you, My Lord.

我能信任你 派席尔 是不是? 
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

啊 是的 当然 大人
Why, yes, of course, My Lord.

如今情势紧急
These are perilous times.

国王必须缔结新盟友
And the crown must forge new alliances.

联姻无疑是最好的方式
And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.

这事我原本可以在御前会议上谈 但太后一定不能知晓
I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the queen mustn't know.

我们不能让她干涉 这项决定王国命运的计划
We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm.

否则风险太大
There's too much at stake.

噢 是的 是的 当然
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.

我会守口如瓶的
I shall be silent as the grave.

我正在筹划跟多恩的马泰尔家族结盟
I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.

弥赛菈公主成年后 嫁给马泰尔家族幼子 确保获得他们的忠诚和军队
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age,ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it.

把弥赛菈送去多恩? 
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

记住 太后一定不能知晓
But remember, the queen mustn't know.

噢 太后一定不能知晓
Ooh, 'the queen mustn't know.'

我喜欢这样的开场白
I love conversations that begin this way.

我打算把弥赛菈公主 嫁给席恩·葛雷乔伊
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.

恕我多问 大人 此事如何操作? 
Forgive me, My Lord, but how?

他是临冬城的养子
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

随罗柏·史塔克征战
He fights for Robb Stark.

正是 但席恩的父亲憎恨史塔克 会说服儿子站到我们这边
Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side.

葛雷乔伊可以从内部搞垮北军 他父亲的舰队也可以为我所用
Greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.

记住 谁也不能说
But remember, you must tell no one.

我打算把弥赛菈公主嫁给谷地的罗宾·艾林
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

莱莎虽不喜欢我
Lysa is not fond of me.

但是也许王室婚约 能够让她不计前嫌
But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

差点还结果了你
She tried to execute you.

你居然打算给她儿子配个公主? 
And you offer her son a princess?

身处此境 记恨只会是累赘 不是吗? 
For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?

你打算让我去促成这门亲事? 
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?

没错 只要我愿意 我可以去跟莱莎说定这事
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to.

维斯特洛的民众会感激你 结束了这场战争 国王也会感谢你夺回了谷地 还有赫伦堡
The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold...  and Harrenhal.

没想到你也信这些东西
Never took you for a superstitious man.

随你自便 推倒再建个呗
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.

不用担心经费
You'll be able to afford it.

我还打算让你统领河间地呢
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

仅仅张张嘴 你就让我跻身于 王国最显赫的贵族之列? 
With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.

你一直为我的家族尽心尽力
You served my family well in the matter of the succession.

杰诺斯·史林特也一样 他受封赫伦堡
So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.

又被你收回
Until you snatched it away.

我需要你把莱莎·艾林争取过来
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.

我可不需要杰诺斯·史林特
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

噢 对了 太后一定不能知晓
Oh, and remember the queen mustn't know.

她也配做御林铁卫? 
A member of the Kingsguard?

好像我还没被羞辱够似的
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

布蕾妮武艺超群
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

忠心耿耿
And she's devoted to me.

吃'美人'布蕾妮的醋? 
Of Brienne the beauty?

我来补偿你  不 陛下
I'll make it up to you.  No, Your Grace.

今晚你该属于另外一个提利尔
There's another Tyrell who requires your attention.

仅凭个人魅力 你赢不到我父亲的支持和军队
You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.

你的封臣都在背后议论你
Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.

新娘成婚半个月了 居然还是处女
Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.

玛格丽是处女? 
And Margaery's a virgin?

要我带她过来吗? 
Shall I bring her to you?

我喝得有点多
I've had quite a bit of wine.

你是国王 你做什么都没错
As is your right. You are a King.

你今晚很漂亮
You look very beautiful.

谢谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

衣服很好看  您喜欢? 
It's a lovely gown.  You think so?

我不知道怎么穿更好
I can't decide how I like it better.

这样 还是这样
This way...  or this way.

你没必要这么做
You certainly don't need it.

虽然… 人们说含蓄的美 才最是撩拨心弦
Although...  some say that beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.

要让我哥哥进来帮忙吗? 
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

什么?   他能让你硬起来
What?  He could get you started.

我知道他不会介意的
I know he wouldn't mind.

要不然我转个身 您可以假装我是他
Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.

我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

您没必要跟我绕弯子
There's no need for us to play games.

谎话留到宫廷上说吧 没必要浪费在这里
Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.

您的敌人不喜欢我们联姻
Your enemies aren't happy about us.

想要拆散我们
They want to tear us apart.

要阻止他们 最好是让我 给你生个孩子
And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly.

我们可以慢慢来
We can try again later.

跟我做也好 加上洛拉斯一起来也好
You decide how you want to do it with me, with me and Loras.

你想怎样都行
However else you like.

你要做什么都可以
Whatever you need to do.

我就弥赛菈这一个女儿
Myrcella is my only daughter.

你居然认为我会任你把她当妓女卖了? 
Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

弥赛菈是王国的公主
Myrcella's a Princess.

这是她与生俱来的使命
Some would say she was born for this.

我绝不同意你把她装船卖给多恩人 就像我当年被卖给劳勃·拜拉席恩一样!
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

在多恩她会很安全
Dorne is the safest place or her.

你疯了吗? 马泰尔家族恨我们入骨
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

所以我们才要拉拢他们
That's why we need to seduce them.

在这场你儿子掀起的战争中 我们需要他们的支持
We're going to need their support in the war your son started.

她是去做人质  是贵宾
She'll be a hostage.  A guest.

我跟你没完
You won't get away with this.

你以为父亲给你的那张纸就能当挡箭牌了? 
You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe.

奈德·史塔克也有一张
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

已经决定了 瑟曦  不
It's done, Cersei.  No.

不可能回头  不!
You cannot stop it.  No!

倘若君临城破弥赛菈又岂会安全? 
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?

你想要她跟坦格利安家族的孩子一样被强暴 屠杀吗? 
Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?

他们会把弥赛菈的漂亮脑袋插在你旁边
They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.

葛雷乔伊家族的席恩 你愿意把自己献给淹神吗? 
Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned God?

让您的仆人席恩 如您一般自海中重生!
Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.

给予他坚石的祝福
Bless him with stone.

给予他钢铁的祝福
Bless him with steel.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die...

必将再起 其势更烈
But rises again harder and stronger.

侏儒 我不喜欢被人忽悠
I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf.

弥赛菈既然要嫁给马泰尔家的儿子 还怎么嫁给罗宾·艾林? 
If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?

是啊 恐怕嫁不成了 很抱歉
No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

我猜也泡汤了
I suppose that's off the table as well.

是啊 恐怕不成了 这件事也很抱歉
Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

再有骗人的戏码别再搭上我了
Leave me out of your next deception.

我本打算让你在下一场里唱头角儿呢
You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception.

我哥哥詹姆还在北方人手里
My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade.

我希望他们能放了他
I would see him released.

这件事非你不可
That's where you come in.

罗柏·史塔克不可能放了弑君者
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.

他当然不会 但他母亲也许可以
No, he won't. But his mother might.

你想再次见到你亲爱的凯特吗? 
How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?

实在不忍心打断这恶心的老鼬鼠
Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.

不 你不用  我没打断他
No, you don't.  No, I don't.

这是干什么? 
What is the meaning of this?

大学士 你让我很失望
You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

我是您忠诚的仆人
I am your loyal servant.

你把我的计划告诉太后 真是太忠诚了
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.

这不是实情 我发誓
It's a falsehood. I swear it.

是八爪蜘蛛瓦里斯干的
It was Varys the spider.

听着 我告诉瓦里斯要把弥赛菈送给葛雷乔伊家
See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.

对小指头说把弥赛菈嫁给罗宾·艾林
I told Little finger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.

至于将弥赛菈送去多恩
I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.

到处都是太监的小小鸟儿
The eunuch has spies everywhere.

把他的命根子剁了喂山羊
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.

不不不  半人 这里没有山羊
No, no, no.  There are no goats, halfman.

你替我姐姐当眼线有多久了? 
How long have you been spying for my sister?

我所做的一切 全是为了兰尼斯特家族
All I did, I did for House Lannister.

一直如此 去问您的父亲大人 去问问他
Always. Your lord father, ask him.

从疯王当政的年代起 我就一直是他忠诚的仆人
I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.

我不喜欢他的胡子  什么? 
I don't like his beard. What?

派席尔 你到底出卖过多少首相? 
How many hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?

艾德·史塔克?  琼恩·艾林? 
Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

他知道关于太后的真相
He knew the truth about the queen.

而且 他想采取行动 告诉劳勃国王
And, well, he planned to act, to tell King Robert.

但你放任他死去 确保他一命呜呼
But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.

兰尼斯特 我做的一切都是为了兰尼斯特
LannisterI always served Lannister.

把他带走 扔进黑牢
Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.

不 不 不要! 不 求求您
Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please.

不! 你不能这样对我!
Don't! You can't do this to me!

我们共同的朋友 把珊莎小姐服侍得不错 您想必乐见这好消息
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.

很好 算我出了一个好主意
Good.One of my better ideas.

看起来大学士派席尔 似乎找到了一条去黑牢的路
And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell.

玩的漂亮 首相大人
Well played, My Lord Hand.

但我是不是该担心一下? 
But should I be worried?

杰诺斯·史林特  派席尔 本就不多人的御前会议每天都在减员
Janos Slynt, Pycelle the small council grows smaller every day.

御前会议在对待首相的问题上名声不好
The council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly.

我可不想追随奈德·史塔克进坟墓
I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.

大人 权力是个有趣的玩意儿

是吗? 他既无王冠 也无财宝 更无神佑
Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the Gods.

他有把剑呐 权掌生死
He has a sword,the power of life and death.

既然手握刀剑之人决定生死 我们何尝假装国王统治一切? 
But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend Kings hold all the power?

奈德·史塔克被砍头 谁是真正的责任人? 
When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible?

我站在我家门阶上 看着我哥被一把匕首刺穿心脏
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep.

那个把他刺成串儿的不是什么恶棍
He weren't much of a villain what skewered him.

那小子 他叫威廉
Willem, the lad's name was.

吐一口痰的功夫都不到 他就跑的没影儿

威廉骑着马回到小镇
Willem came riding back into town.

我一斧子奋力砸进他的脑壳 以至于他就顶着那把斧子下葬了
I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it.

威廉的马把我带到长城 从那以后我就成了守夜人
Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since.

行了 这能帮你好好睡觉吗 啊?

粮草都不够自己吃

我们不会处决俘虏的 波顿大人

当然 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

军官们将很有价值
The officers will be useful.

他们中的某些应该知晓泰温・兰尼斯特的计划

无论如何 我们很快就知道了
Well, we'll learn soon enough.

在我家族有句古谚'裸体的人少有秘密

Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it?

说说看 是不是我哥哥尸骨未寒 你就找到新靠山了?

我很清楚您不怎待见我 这的确让我非常犯愁
I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly,

可我今日来此并非要讨您欢心
I did not come here today seeking your affection.

等您挥师君临时 面临的不一定是座难攻的城堡 也可能是… 大敞的城门
When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or...  open gates.

All of these tents look the same to me.

我也花了好几星期才搞清楚营地的路线
It took me weeks to learn way around the camp.

甚至有两次我在别人更衣的时候闯了进去

等我好不容易记清楚自己的帐篷 我们却又要拔营了
And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.

也许是因为国王打鼾?

或者 他喜爱独处?

你从未结婚 是吧? 
You've never married, have you?

I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

不过也许这样才好
Though perhaps it's for the best.

因为你似乎根本不明白婚姻的意义 我来做个解释吧

在朝从君 在家从夫 这就是我的婚姻

If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.

史塔克夫人 我很好奇为何您会站在我弟弟那边
It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark.

您丈夫是支持我称王的
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

史塔克大人为维护正统而献身
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

你却在这个僭王身边责问我
And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.

我们有共同的敌人
We share a common enemy.

按照律法 铁王座属于我
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

否认这点的都是我的敌人
All those that deny that are my foes.

从多恩到长城 全境都在否认你啊
The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall.

糟老头子临死时念叨着否认 未出生的婴儿在妈妈肚子里踢闹着否认
Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs.

没人想让你当他的国王
No one wants you for their King.

老哥 你就是不爱交朋友
You never wanted any friends, brother.

但是没有朋友相助 还争什么权力
But a man without friends is a man without power.

看在我们母亲的份上
For the sake of the mother who bore us,

今晚上我给你时间考虑
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

降下叛旗 在天亮之前投效于我 我就保留你在御前会议中的重臣席位
Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the council.

甚至在我儿子出生之前 我仍旧把你指定为我的继承人
I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me.

否则你就只有毁灭一途
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

你仔细看看那边的平原 老哥
Look across those fields, brother.

看到那些旗帜了吗? 
Can you see all those banners?

你以为几根裹着毛料的杆子就能让你称王? 
You think a few bolts of cloth will make you King?

可是高举这破布杆子的军队 能让我称王
The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me King.

天明之时 就见分晓
Come the dawn, we shall see.

记住你自己的罪孽 蓝礼大人
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

长夜黑暗 处处险恶
The night is dark and full of terrors.

这就是我曾敬爱过的人 你相信吗? 
Would you believe I loved him once?

我还以为我们是受欢迎的呢
I thought we were welcome.

如果您听说一个多斯拉克部落正在逼近您的城市 也会这么做的 卡丽熙
If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.

丹妮莉丝 '风暴降生' 来自坦格利安家族
Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.

大人 您早知道我? 
You know me, My Lord?

只是有所耳闻 卡丽熙
Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

而我并非什么大人 只是一介俗商
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

世人称您为龙之母
They call you the Mother of Dragons.

那我该怎么称呼您? 
And what should I call you?

噢 我的名字很长 发音对于异国人来更是不易
Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce.

我只不过是个香料商人
I am simply a trader of spices.

但我们'十三巨子' 肩负职责 必须管理和保卫魁尔斯 古往今来最伟大的城市
But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.

夸尔斯的壮美令人动容
The beauty of Quarth is legendary

我们可否目睹一下真龙? 
Might we see the dragons?

我的 朋友 我们旅途颠簸
My friend, we have travelled very far.

水尽粮绝
We have no food, no water.

只要我的子民得以温饱 我将感激不尽 为
Once I see my people fed, I would be honored

恕我直言 龙之母 没人目睹真龙现世
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

总有些满腹狐疑的朋友 怀疑您的孩子们是否 真的存在
Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist.

我们只是请求亲眼一见
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

哈 我对此毫不怀疑
Oh, I don't think you are.

但是你我素昧谋面 我的意见可说服不了大家啊
But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

在我的家乡 迎接宾客的是厅堂内的礼遇 而非门外的羞辱
Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.

那么 或许您应该启程回乡才是
Then perhaps you should return to where you come from.

你答应了要接待我们
You promised to receive me.

我们是接待了你们
We have received you.

你我同在此 眼下不正是接待? 
Here we are, and here you are.

如果你不让我们进城 我们全都活不下去
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

对此我们深表遗憾
Which we shall deeply regret.

但古往今来 最伟大的魁尔斯城 岂能为多斯拉克蛮子敞开大门? 
But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

卡丽熙 请您小心说话
Khaleesi, please be careful.

他日吾龙成器 定将归来取走本应属于我的东西 摧毁那些未曾公正待我之人
When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me.

燎原御敌 怒火焚城
We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.

拒我于城外者 将第一个葬身火海
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

真不愧是个坦格利安
You are a true Targaryen.

可惜 正如你刚才所说 如果我们不让你们进城 你们全都活不下去 所以…
Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so...

一个小姑娘就让你怕得关门大吉 这作风可配不上 古往今来最伟大的城市
Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.

讨论已经结束 札罗・赞旺・达梭斯
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

十三巨子已经发完言了
The Thirteen have spoken.

我也是十三巨子之一
I am one of the Thirteen

札罗・赞旺・达梭斯 而我还有话要说
'十三巨子'之一 and I am still speaking.

这个小女孩威胁说要焚我城池 难道你想请她入城品酒不成? 
The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

她是龙之母
She is the Mother of Dragons.

你认为她眼睁睁地看着子民挨饿 还能无动于衷吗? 
Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire?

放这区区几十名多斯拉克人进城 就能毁了大家不成? 
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city.

况且 我也是蛮族出身 从盛夏群岛到了这里 魁尔斯还不是屹立如初? 
After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.

我们已经决定了
Our decision is final.

我以律法之名 为她 她的子民和她的龙担保
I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons in accordance with the law.

夫人 欢迎来到魁尔斯
Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.

村里藏有金子吗? 银子呢? 
Is there gold or silver in the village?

我不是村里人 无旗兄弟会在哪? 
I'm not from the village.    Where is the Brotherhood?

我不知道什么兄弟会
I don't know what that is.

你们两个 把泰温大人的东西送到他的住处
You two, take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

我们以为您明天才会到 泰温大人
We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

为什么不把犯人关进牢房? 
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

牢房已经满了 大人
Cells are overflowing,My Lord.

这群人在这里待不了多久
This lot won't be here long.

不需要为他们准备固定的牢房
Don't need no permanent place.

审讯完之后 通常就…
After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...

难道我们人手太多?  多得要将年轻劳力和娴熟工匠弃之不用? 
Are we so wellmanned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?

你 有什么手艺吗? 
You,do you have a trade?

看什么看! 跪下!
What are you looking at?Kneel!

跪下! 不然把你的心肺挖出来 小子
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

'他'不会照做的
He'll do no such thing.

这个'他'是个女孩 你这白痴 穿着男孩的衣服
This one's a girl,you idiot, dressed as a boy.

为什么?   上路更安全 大人
Why?    Safer to travel, My Lord.

这帮贱种里难得出个机灵鬼
More than I can say for this lot.

给这些人安排活干
Get these prisoners to work.

我需要个新侍酒
I need a new cupbearer.

你可是稀客 堂弟
Your visits are too few, cousin.

摄政太后陛下 命令你即刻释放派席尔大学士
Her Grace,the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.

这是陛下的授权状 原来如此
Here's your warrant.   So it is.

陪我喝一杯如何? 
Will you take a cup with me?

我发现喝温酒有助于睡眠
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

我代表陛下前来宣令 不是来跟你喝酒的 小恶魔
I am here at her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp.

如果我亲爱的姐姐真那么在乎派席尔
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

我觉得她似乎应该亲自来
I would have thought she'd come herself.

但她却派了你
Instead she sends you.

对此 我该作何理解? 
What am I to make of that?

随你怎么理解 只须你马上放人
I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.

你是直接从瑟曦那里得到的命令? 
And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?

我说了不止一次
As I said several times.

而你却等了这么久才来传达给我? 
And you've waited this long to deliver the information?

摄政太后给我下达命令之后 我毫无延误地将其带给你
When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.

瑟曦对你的信任可见一斑 在狼时这么个当口 还允许你进她的闺房
Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.

摄政太后重任在肩
The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities.

常常通宵达旦地忙于公事
She often works from dusk till dawn.

有你通宵达旦地帮她 她一定非常欢喜
She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.

打小她就喜欢薰衣草精油
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

难怪 抹了圣油的骑士啊
An anointed Knight, yes.

告诉我 瑟曦封你作骑士 是上床前还是上床后呐? 
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed?

怎么? 没话说了? 
What? Nothing to say?

就不会对我来点抗议么 爵士? 
No more warnings for me, Ser?

你必须收回这些下流的指控
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

拜托 你有没有想过 假如我告诉乔佛里 你睡了他老妈 他会有何看法呢? 
Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?

是她强迫的你? 
Did she take you against your will?

你不会自卫吗 骑士? 
Can you not defend yourself, Knight?

是您父亲 泰温大人 从我当上国王的侍从那天起 他就嘱咐我一切听太后差遣
Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.

包括嘱咐你和她上床 嗯? 
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

我的意思是 我只是奉命
I only meant I did as I was bid.

但是却痛恨这一切 你指望我相信这个? 
Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe?

朝廷的高位 骑士的身份 我姐姐夜里为你张开的双腿
A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night.

哦 是啊 这一切对你来说太糟糕了
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

等在这里 等国王陛下来亲自裁决
Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

发发慈悲吧! 大人 求求您
Mercy! Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

省省吧 这些话给乔佛里说去 他最喜欢听别人苦苦哀求
Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

大人 这些都是令姐 太后陛下的命令
My Lord, it was your sister's bidding the Queen.

我会立刻离开都城 我发誓
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

我想不必 大人? 
No, I think not.    My Lord?

我父亲不是要你遵从她么
My father told you to obey my sister.

留在她的身边 保持她的信任
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

随时满足她的需求
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

之前的事情不会有人知道 只要你忠诚于我
No one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me.

而回报呢 我想知道瑟曦在干什么 去了哪里 见了谁 谈了些什么 所有的一切
I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk ofeverything.

你都必须告诉我
And you will tell me.

行 大人 我会的
Yes, My Lord, I will.

我发誓 照您说的做
I swear it, as you command.

为我们的共识干一杯
Let us drink to our understanding.

哦 你没有杯子 那就算了
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

开心点 堂弟 我姐姐是个大美人
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman.

而你做的一切都是为了国家
And it's all for the good of the realm.

回去告诉她 我恳求她的原谅 我不希望我们之间有任何矛盾 从今往后
Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that henceforth

未经她同意 我不会轻举妄动
I shall do nothing without her consent.

噢 我会把派席尔还给她
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

是吗?  是的 我明天就放人
You will?  Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

如果她愿意 瑟曦可以把他当宠物养 但是绝不能让他留在御前会议
Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants, but I will not have him on the council.

我可以保证 他毫'发'无伤 不过严格说起来 这不算实话
I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

保持船距 保持队形
Stay within one table length.

你的指骨给你带来好运了吗? 
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

自从您把它们切掉以来 我过的一直不赖 陛下
Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

而且省了清理四坨指甲的功夫
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

省了清理'四枚'指甲的功夫
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

不明白你为什么要一直带着它们
Never understood why you had to wear them.

它提醒着我曾经的出身 我现在的身份
It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now.

以及您的公正无私
It reminds me of your justice.

您对我的惩罚很公正 而且切肉的刀您也用的很好
It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.

你既是个英雄也是个走私贩
You were a hero and a smuggler.

善行并不能抵消恶行 恶行也不能掩盖善行
A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.

这正是我想让儿子学到的
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

他听你的吗?  听我的? 
Does he listen?  To me?

但如果是您的红袍女让他从鸦巢上跳下去…
But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest

我相信你还没有忘记走私者的把戏吧
I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.

我已奉公守法生活了十七
I've lived within the law for 17

我需要你再做一次走私者
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

随时随地都可以
Any shore, any night.

需要我走私什么? 
What am I bringing ashore?

不许告诉任何人 我们之间也不得再提此事
No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.

我是您忠诚的仆人 陛下 永远都是 但肯定还有别的办法 更讲求荣誉的办法
I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

讲求荣誉无法赢得战争
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

你害怕吗 洋葱骑士
Are you afraid,onion knight?

有人告诉我 长夜黑暗 处处险恶
Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.

做走私贩的时候你曾运过更讨厌的货物吧
You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time.

你是个好人吗 戴佛斯・席沃斯爵士? 
Are you a good man,Ser Davos Seaworth?

我只能说说我是个复杂的人 夫人 好坏参半
I'd say my parts are mixed, My Lady good and bad.

如果一个洋葱有一半腐烂发黑 那它就是一个烂洋葱
If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion.

一个人非善即恶
A man is good or he is evil.

那么你是?  哦 当然是好人
And which are you?   Oh, good.

我也算某种形式的骑士 光明与生命的斗士
I'm a Knight myself of sorts, a champion of light and life.

哦 那对你来说一定感觉不错
Well, that must be very nice for you.

你爱自己的妻子吗?  是的
Do you love your wife?    I do.

但你却结识过其他的女人
Yet you have known other women.

别扯上我的妻子
Don't talk about my wife.

我没有说她 我是说其他女人
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

你想看这长袍下的身体
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

光之王真是奇怪 竟然让您在暗影中行事
Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.

黑暗处可是没有影子的 戴佛斯爵士
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

影子是光明的仆人 烈焰的子孙
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

惟有最耀眼的火光 方能映照出最黑暗的阴影
And the brighter the flame,the darker they are.

这里本来没有栅栏 他们堵住了通道
These weren't here before.They've barred the passage.

这阻挡不了我们
They can't bar our passage.

只有一位真神 戴佛斯爵士 他只保佑侍奉他的人 你发誓?   以圣母之名
There's only one God,Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.  you swear it? by the Mother.

我儿对铁王座毫无兴趣
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

那我们之间就没有理由敌对了
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

您儿子可以继续自封为北境之王 卡林湾以北都将属于史塔克家族
Your son can go on calling himself King in the North, the Starks will have dominion over all lands North of Moat Cailin,

只要他宣誓效忠于我
Provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

宣誓什么? 
And the wording of this oath?

跟十八年前奈德·史塔克对劳勃的宣誓一样
The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago.

凯特 他们的友谊曾让王国归于一统
Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.

那么 若我儿效忠 将有何回报? 
And in return for my son's loyalty?

明天早晨我将会击溃我哥哥的军队
In the morning i'll destroy my brother's army.

拜拉席恩和史塔克将会并肩作战
Baratheon and Stark will fight

对付共同的敌人
Their common enemy together,

就像以往的许多次一样
As they have done many times before.

我们两家素来亲近
Our two houses have always been close,

因此我恳请您重新考虑一下
Which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle.

终止战争 与您的哥哥谈判议和吧
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

与史坦尼斯谈判议和? 
Negotiate with Stannis?

您也见到他那副德行了
You heard him out there.

还不如让我去和狂风理论
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

请把我的条件带给您儿子
Please bring my terms to your son.

我相信我们生来就该是盟友
I believe we are natural allies.

希望他也这么看
I hope he feels the same.

如若我们携手 两周之内便能结束这场战争
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

不!  跟我来!  你必须为此偿命!  住手 等等 不是她!
No. Follow me!  you'll die for this. no, wait, it wasn't her!

他们会绞死你的
They'll hang you for this.

在国王的营帐里 快去!  快!
Inside the king's tent, go! now!

你若是死了 怎么替他复仇? 
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

洛拉斯  大人 夫人
Loras. My Lord, My Lady.

史坦尼斯一小时内就会抵达
Stannis will be here in an hour.

到时候 蓝礼的封臣们会争先恐后倒向他
When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

为获得赦免 你的那些前同僚们
Your former companions will fight for the privilege

会将你出卖给他们的新国王以求自保
Of selling you to their new king.

想必你就是来'争先'的
And you want that privilege for yourself.

你总该注意到我是在向您进言 而非史坦尼斯  现在不是争吵的时候
You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis. there's no time for this.

你备马回高庭去吧 妹妹
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.

我可绝对不会躲着史坦尼斯
I'm not running from Stannis.

是塔斯的布蕾妮谋杀了蓝礼
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

我不相信那个说法 你也不信
I don't believe that. you don't believe that.

谁是从吾王之死中获益最多的人? 
Who gained the most from our king's death?

我要用剑刺穿他那张道貌岸然的脸
I will put a sword through his righteous face.

他本可以成为一个真正的国王
He would have been a true king,

在这世上 你最渴求什么? 
What do you desire most in this world?

我一直认为复仇是最纯粹的动机 然而你找不到干掉史坦尼斯的机会
I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis,

不用等到他上岸 你早就被剁成碎片了
You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground.

如果你想要伸张正义
If it is justice that you want,

躺在坟墓里可不能替他复仇
You can't avenge him from the grave.

他是如此英俊
He was very handsome.

自封国王是一回事 君临天下又是另一回事了
Calling yourself King doesn't make you one.

如果蓝礼不是国王 我又如何称得上王后
And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

您还想当一个王后吗? 
Do you want to be a queen?

我要成为唯一的王后
I want to be the queen.

暗指凯特琳·史塔克的好像最多
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.

真的? 谁会这么想? 
Really? who'd have thought?

有人说是他的彩虹铁卫之一所为
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

还有些人说在和谈失败之后
While still others say it was Stannis himself who did it

是史坦尼斯亲自出马杀了他
After negotiations went sour.

不管是谁干的 我都为他拍手叫好
Whomever did it, I say well done.

瓦里斯可没你叫的开心
It's not what Varys says.

他说蓝礼的军队已经转而投向史坦尼斯 这下史坦尼斯的陆军和海军都超过了我们
He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.

小指头说我们付得起三倍于他们的军费
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.

那我只能说 父亲惯得你太把钱当回事了
And I say father raised you to have too much respect for money.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩即将向我们进军
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,

火烧眉毛了
Sooner rather than later.

你就没有点别的事情好去忙活?  比如把我女儿关进板条箱里以便装船送走? 
Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?

她在多恩会很安全
She'll be safer in Dorne.

当然 我知道你有多关心她的安危
Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.

很凑巧被你说中了
It so happens that I am.

弥赛菈是个甜美纯真的小姑娘
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl

我不会因为你的所作所为而去为难她
And I don't blame her at all for you.

你不觉得自己在搞阴谋和耍诡计方面
Aren't you always so clever

有点聪明过头了吗? 
With your schemes and your plots?

阴谋和诡计不就是一回事么
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

他们就要打过来了
They are going to attack us.

你无需为此操心
No need to concern yourself over it.

国王将亲自主持守城部署
The King is taking personal charge of siege preparations.

我能否直截了当地问一句 国王脑子里都装了些什么? 
May I ask specifically what the King has in mind?

管你是直截了当 还是拐弯抹角
You may specifically or you may ask vaguely.

反正答案都一样
The answer will be the same.

我们在讨论的事可不是儿戏
It's important that we talk about this.

对御前会议成员封锁敏感信息
It's the king's royal prerogative

也是国王的特权之一
To withhold sensitive information from his councilors.

你没骗我 对吧 堂弟?  当然没有  可这明摆着是句谎话
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?  no. that's a lie right there.

我没撒谎 我为什么要撒谎? 
It is not a lie. why would I lie?

如果那些关于我哥哥和姐姐
If the vile allegations

的恶毒诽谤不小心是真的
Against my brother and sister are true,

当我告诉詹姆
Do you think it will make Jaime more likely

你上过我老姐的话
To kill you or less likely?

你觉得他宰了你的可能性会有多大 嗯? 
When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

我对您说的都是实话
I'm telling you the truth.

我看你的小命多半会变成一点抚恤金
The smart money would be on more likely.

她正在制造野火
She's making wildfire.

但他应该也会为一时冲动宰了你而略表同情吧
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.

炼金术士公会已经受到委任
The alchemists' guild is being commissioned.

我觉得只有一个办法可以确认此事
I suppose there's only one way to find out.

他们的地窖中贮藏了上千罐
They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults.

他们计划将野火从城墙上投射出去
They are planning to launch them from the city walls

攻击史坦尼斯的舰队和军队
Into Stannis's ships and armies.

她何时告诉你这些的? 
When did she tell you this?

我从她和火术士们的谈话里听来的
I heard her talking with the Pyromancer.

另一天晚上 在我离开她之后
And the other night after I left her,

她又去见了那个人
She went to meet him.

我发誓  用什么来发誓?  以我的性命起誓  可我又不在乎你的命
I swear to you. swear to me on what?  on my life. but I don't care about your life.

以七神之荣光
In the light of the seven,

以所有的神圣公义之名
By all that is holy and right,

我 蓝赛尔·兰尼斯特 庄严起誓
I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow

好的 好的 这就够了
All right, all right. enough.

拷问你也真够无聊的
Even torturing you is boring.

哦 蓝赛尔 请告知我的朋友波隆
Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn

如果在提利昂大人身上发生了什么不幸 就请你宰了我
Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.

乐意之至
It will be my pleasure.

陛下  什么事? 
Your Grace. what is it?

关于你弟弟的事我很遗憾 陛下
I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.

人们都在为他哀悼 我希望您能了解这些
I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.

陛下 愚人爱傻瓜
Your Grace.  fools love a fool.

我也为他哀悼 那个小时候的他
I grieve for him as well  for the boy he was,

而非长大后的他
Not the man he grew to be.

我必须和您谈谈我在洞穴里看到的一幕
I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave.

我以为我先前说的很明白了
I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to

我们无需再谈此事
Speak to me on this matter.

我不记得你有健忘症
I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.

而我也不记得您会畏惧真相
And Ive never known you to hide from the truth.

你是来教训我什么叫真相的? 
You've come to lecture me on truth?

我是来告诉您 我看到
I've come to tell you that what I saw

我弟弟的封臣们现在都已投入我麾下
All my brother's bannermen have come to my side.

除了像懦夫一样逃走的提利尔家
Except the tyrells, who fled like cowards.

他们现在也构不成威胁了
They won't be able to resist us now.

很快我就会坐上铁王座
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

付出这样的代价 真不值得 即便是为了铁…  关于此事 我不想再听
Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the iron...  i'll hear no more about it.

我们何时起航前往君临? 
When do we sail for King's Landing?

等我的军团整合完毕后
As soon as i've consolidated my troops.

我们很快就能解决兰尼斯特的舰队
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

一旦黑水湾被清理干净
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

我们就能将大部队运送到城下 夺取王都
We'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.

那您会带梅丽珊卓夫人一同前往吗? 
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

这不是你该关心的事
That's not your concern.

如果您夺取君临时将她带在身边 胜利就会属于她
If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

我从没想过需要质疑你的忠诚 我搞错了么? 
I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

忠诚的侍奉也意味着进谏难言的真相
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

好吧 何为真相? 
All right, what's the truth?

前来传播她的异端信仰
Preaching her foreign religion.

有人相信只要她在您耳边低语 您便会遵从她的指示
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.

您从蓝礼那里赢得了那些封臣
You won those bannermen from Renly.

不要因为她的缘故失去他们
Don't lose them to her.

我们进军君临 但是不带梅丽珊卓夫人
We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre.

而你负责率领舰队进攻黑水湾
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

陛下 我很荣幸 但是我在海上生涯中
Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea

只学会如何回避船只 而非攻击它们
Was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

其他的大人不会满意的
The other lords won't be happy.

这些大人没有被我以叛徒之名绞死
Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky

就该暗自庆幸了
I don't hang them for treason.

难言的真相是把双刃剑 戴佛斯爵士
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

买点水果吧 大人 新鲜的水果
Buy my fruit, My Lord. fresh fruit.

史坦尼斯的步兵
Stannis has more infantry,

战船和马匹都比我们更多
More ships, more horses.

你整天净操心这么些东西
There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.

哼 操心这些东西也没让我能干掉他们
Well, i've never actually been able to kill people with it.

很好 否则我早就失业了
Good thing. i'd be out of a job.

你老爹最近没给你新指示? 
What about your father?

好几周没见到他的渡鸦了
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

忙着被罗柏·史塔克再三羞辱
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is timeconsuming.

按照乔佛里的守城计划
We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis,

我们阻止不了史坦尼斯破城
Not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

人们已经变得浮夸 傲慢 恶臭不堪
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

王榻之上 姐弟私通 众人惊诧 他们乱伦的孽种何时会腐化变质? 
Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

他的论断很有说服力嘛
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

看看他对你送的命名日礼物做了些什么 就不见得了
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

国王已经没救了
The King is a lost cause.

我现在关心的是我们这些剩下的家伙
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

乱伦孽种在王宫里
A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls

随着畸形小魔猴的笛声翩翩起舞
To the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

这家伙的想像力可真够丰富的 他在说你呢  啥? 
You have to admire his imagination.  he's talking about you. what?

民众认为国王是你的傀儡
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

他们把这城市的灾难归咎于你
They blame you for the city's ills.

归咎于我? 我在尽力拯救他们啊
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

说服我有什么用
You don't need to convince me.

你们就是海婊子号的船员? 
You're the crew of the sea bitch?

我是船长 欢迎上船
I'm your commander. welcome.

船长命令你们停下
Your Captain commands you to stop.

我们这是要往哪去 船长? 
Where are we heading, Captain?

去磐石海岸 劫掠村庄
The Stony Shore to raid their villages.

只要你们干得漂亮 到时自然有大把铁钱
There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,

女人当然也不缺
If you do your jobs well.

干得漂不漂亮谁说了算? 
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

巴隆还没把你射出来的时候
I have been reaving and raping

铁钱盐妾我都有大把了 船长
Since before you left balon's balls, Captain.

别以为你能对老子指手划脚
Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it.

也别以为我会把船长当回事
Don't reckon i've got much use for a Captain at all.

我告诉你 船长的事我自己都能搞定
I'm thinking I can do the job of Captain real well myself.

我就缺条船
All I need is a ship.

你知道我会怎么搞到
You wouldn't know where I could find myself

这条船么 嗯? 
A ship now, would you?

抢下船 去哪儿都可以
Take the ship, head out on your own.

只不过我会把你拿下 拖回来 锁起来
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains,

然后以叛徒罪名吊死你 别说了 我们投降
And hang you for a traitor.  stop. we yield.

第一次当船长 可喜可贺
Congratulations on your first command.

谢谢你来送我
Thank you. kind of you to come see me off.

噢 我不是来送你的
Oh, I'm not here for you.

我正准备动身去红港
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.

我有三十条船 这儿都没地儿摆 太窄了  你最好现在就过去
I've got 30 ships. there's nowhere to put them here.  too narrow. you'd better get out there.

小心你的手下私自开船出海
Wouldn't want them to set sail without you.

那不可能
That would never happen.

哪怕我让船员在甲板上呆一年 他们都会照做不误
My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to.

祝你在磐石海岸玩得愉快
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

来 跟我来
Come on, i'll take you out.

你的大副 达格摩
Dagmer, your first mate.

你怎么不跟其他人一起? 
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

莫非他们派你来给我领航 打算半路把我扔海里? 
Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea?

这又够他们笑一阵的了
That would be good for a laugh.

除非你证明自己 否则无法赢得他们的尊重
They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.

抢个鸟不拉屎的小渔村
And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging

我怎么证明自己? 
Pisspoor fishing villages?

可这就是我父亲派给我的任务
And yet that's the task my father has given me

要靠这来证明我是真正的铁种
To prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.

他们都是铁种
They're all Iron Islanders.

他们是该听命行事还是奉行己道? 
Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?

磐石海岸离托伦方城不远
The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.

那儿是陶哈家族的领地
The seat of the House of Tallhart

这战利品比几个渔夫女儿可更有说服力
A more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters.

怎么 你觉得我们拿不下? 
What, you don't think we could take it?

问题在于我们拿下以后也守不了几天
We could never hold it for more than a few days.

一旦临冬城得知我们攻克了托伦方城
As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

史塔克就会派人来把城池夺回去
The Starks would send their men to take it back.

史塔克延长了战线
The Starks have overextended their lines.

长夏已尽 粮草很难跟上
Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time

他们的苦日子要来了
Keeping their men and horses fed.

对于冬天 我们永远不会比史塔克更了解
The Starks understand winter better than we ever will.

严寒击不倒他们
The cold won't beat them.

探子报说 北方领主之间正在滋生着不满的情绪
Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords.

他们想早点回家
They want to return home

赶在庄稼烂掉之前进行收割
And gather the harvest before the crops turn.

而我确信我们的营地也有他们的探子潜伏 他们也会回报南方领主之间滋生的不满情绪
And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments.  they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords.

战争嘛 没人会满足
This is war; no one's content.

长久以来 我们低估了史塔克小子
We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long.

他很有战争头脑 他的手下也敬仰他
He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him.

只要他接连打胜仗
And as long as he keeps winning battles,

他们就永远相信他是北境之王
They'll keep believing he is King in the North.

你们一直坐等他打败仗
You've been waiting for him to fail.

但我们不出手
He is not going to fail,

他怎么吃败仗
Not without our help.

那么我们该怎么出手? 
So how do we stop him?

大人 我们忙了一整夜没合眼
We've worked through the niht, My Lord.

或许睡点觉会事半功倍
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

雷吉诺 我觉得也是
As I think you would, Reginald.

但既然你是我族亲
And because you're my cousin,

大家睡觉的时候你也得给我醒着
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

走吧 你妻子肯定很想你
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

我妻子在兰尼斯港
My wife's in Lannisport.

那么你得快马加鞭了
Well, then you'd better start riding.

趁我没改主意把你的脑袋送还她之前 赶紧走
Go before I change my mind and send her your head.

要不是你姓兰尼斯特
If your name wasn't Lannister,

厨子帐篷里那些锅就该你去擦了 滚!
You'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. go!

我们还要在这好一会儿
We'll be here for some time.

女泉城是谁家的封地?  帮我想想  回大人 是慕顿家族
And who are the lords of Maidenpool?  remind me. House Mooton, My Lord.

他们的族徽是? 
And what is their sigil?

女泉城的姑娘理应记得这些
I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.

你是个北方人 对吧? 
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

很好 再问一次 你家在哪儿? 
Good. one more time, where are you from?

回大人 是荒冢屯 达斯丁家族的封地
Barrowton, My Lord. House Dustin.

黑色王冠下的交叉双斧
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

北方人怎么说罗柏·史塔克? 
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?

他们叫他少狼主
They call him the Young Wolf.

他们说他骑着一头巨大的冰原狼冲锋陷阵
They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf.

他们说他可以随意变成狼身
They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants.

他们说他是不死的
They say he can't be killed.

那么你信这些话么? 
And do you believe them?

凡人皆有一死
Anyone can be killed.

女孩嘴紧闭
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

朋友之间说悄悄话 好不好? 
And friends may talk in secret, yes?

小子变做女孩
A boy becomes a girl.

某人早就知道
And I was always aware.

但女孩有秘密
But the girl keeps secrets.

某人不说破
It is not for a man to spoil them.

你现在跟他们一伙
You're one of them now.

早知道我就让你烧死算了
I should have let you burn.

现在你给他们取水
And you fetch water for one of them now.

你和某人 谁对谁错? 
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

我没得选择
I didn't have a choice.

某人要还债
A man pays his debts.

红神是债主 可爱的女孩
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

惟有死亡方能换取生命
And only death may pay for life.

女孩救了某人和另外两人
You saved me and the two I was with.

女孩取走三条本属于红神的命
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

就得拿三条命来偿还
We have to give them back.

某人去办事
And the man will do the rest.

你有三条命 不多也不少
Three lives I will give you

三条之后 我们两清
No more, no less, and we're done.

折磨大家的那个人
The one who tortures everyone.

我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

他们叫他'记事本'
They call him the Tickler.

走吧 女孩 你的大人口渴了
Go now, girl. your master is thirsty.

他本应找到我们 吹响号角
He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

断掌自会掌握好时间
The Halfhand does things in his own time.

我叔叔跟我讲过他的故事
My uncle told me stories about him.

那些故事大多是真事
Most of them are true.

我听说上次冬天 断掌有一半时间都在长城之外
I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall.

他被大雪堵在了风声峡以北
He was North of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.

只好等到冰雪消融
Had to wait for the thaw.

这么说独自一人在这里活下去也不是不可能啊
So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.

如果是断掌 的确有可能
Well, possible for the Halfhand.

吉莉会喜欢上这儿的
Gilly would love it here.

没什么比恋爱中的男人更恶心了
There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.

手脚不要停下
About time you did something.

至少会暖和点
At least you'll keep warm.

先民拳峰
The fist of the First Men.

想想这里有多古老
Think of how old this place is

那时坦格利安还没征服安达尔人
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

那时维斯特洛的主人还是先民 不是安达尔人
Before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.

那时我还没死 别说了 谢谢
Before I die, please, stop talking.

几千几万年之前
Thousands and thousands of years ago,

先民们就站在我们现在所站的位置上
The First Men stood here where we're standing

度过漫漫长夜
All through the long night.

你们觉得他们长什么样? 我是说先民
What do you think they were like, the First Men?

脑袋正常的人才不会跑到这个破地方来
Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.

我觉得他们满脸恐惧
I think they were afraid.

我觉得他们是来这里躲避什么东西的
I think they came here to get away from something.

我觉得他们没能躲开
And I don't think it worked.

一声号角 兄弟归来
One blast is for rangers returning.

两声号角才是野人来袭
Wildlings is two blasts.

所以你得一直等待着
So you got to stand there waiting,

一声是兄弟
One blast for friends,

三声 是异鬼
And three for White Walkers.

但是一千年来
It's been 1,000 years,

吹三声号角的遭数只有一次
But that's the only time they blow the horn three times.

既然是一千年前的事 你怎么知道? 
But if it's been 1,000 years, how do yu know?

那个…  我从书里看到的
Well... I read it in a book.

是'断掌'科林
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

没错 可以多活一天了
Aye, we'll live another day.

我记得一句水手们的俗语
I remember reading an old sailor's proverb

噢 我没做过这样的实验
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.

不过应该差不离
It could well be true.

这种物质火焰极热
The substance burns so hot,

可以烧融木头 石头 甚至钢铁
It melts wood, stone, even steel,

当然 烧融血肉不在话下
And, of course, flesh.

这种物质火焰极热 血肉遇着它就跟油脂一样
The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.

自从龙消失之后 野火就成了
After the Dragons died, wildfire was the key

坦格利安家统治的关键 我的伙伴有话要说
To the Targaryen power.  my companion takes issue.

我告诉你 推着小车到军营周围
If I could tell you how many crazy old men

把他们那些装着猪屎的罐子吹得神乎其神
I've seen pushing carts around army camps

这样的疯老头子我见得多了… 无意冒犯  我们组织不是卖猪屎的
Making grand claims about jars full of pig shit...  no offense meant. our order does not deal in pig shit.

这种物质看起来像火
The substance is fire given form.

在梅葛王的时代我们完善了配方
And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.

把罐子架在投石机上 往敌军阵营里投
The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.

你手头有多少存货? 
How much do you have?

就算你能找到训练有素的士兵来操作投石机
If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults,

十次中也不见得能打中一次 况且训练有素的士兵全被你父亲带到河间地去了
Then maybe you'd hit your target one time in 10, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.

大人 这个人在侮辱我
My Lord, this man is insulting.

我不知道你见没见过打仗 老头
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man,

但是现在情况有点麻烦
But things can get a bit messy.

因为当我们把这玩意丢向史坦尼斯的时候
'cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,

他也会把它们丢回来
He's flinging them right back at us.

士兵们会死 会吓得尿裤子 最后逃跑
Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

这意味着两败俱伤
Which means pots falling,

意味着城内也要遭受焚烧
Which means fire inside the walls,

意味着这本意拿来守卫城市的昏招
Which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city

最后反而把城市烧没了
End up burning it down.

我的朋友还是持怀疑态度
My friend remains unconvinced.

如果是伊里斯·坦格利安在世之时
He would not dare insult my order

他可不敢对我的组织如此无礼
Whilst aerys Targaryen lived.

但是他早就死了
Well, he's not living anymore.

而且这么多野火罐子也没帮上他什么忙 不是么? 
And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they?

打胜仗靠的是人 可不是什么魔术戏法
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

自从您姐姐太后陛下下令以来
We have been working tirelessly day and night

我们不知疲倦 日夜劳作
Ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.

目前我们已经拥有
Our present count stands

足够将史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的舰队和军队
Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet

恐怕我得赞同我的顾问 哈林智者
I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.

这房间里的东西会把整个君临都毁掉
Te contents of this room could lay King's Landing low.

你不必再为我姐姐制作野火了
You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer.

来为我做
You'll be making it for me.

今后他就可以养活自己了
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

让他睡一会 多莉亚
Let him sleep, Doreah.

谢谢你 我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

看到札罗为你订做的衣服了吗? 
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

他们说他是魁尔斯最富有的人
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

而且如果魁尔斯是厄索斯大陆最富有的城市
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos

上次有个富人送我衣服
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,

是为了把我卖给卓戈卡奥
He was selling me to Khal Drogo.

札罗对我们款待有加 但我们对他一无所知
Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.

当人们心情愉悦的时候
Men like to talk about other men

在札罗的宴会上 您看起来会像一位真正的公主
You would look like a real princess in Xaro's

她不是什么公主 她是我们的卡丽熙
She's not a princess. she's a Khaleesi.

他们邀请您为上宾
You should wear it, Khaleesi.

您该换上这件衣服 卡丽熙
It would be rude not to.

你一定要去逛逛夜市
And you must visit the night market.

魁尔斯的夜市绝对是你前所未见 听起来棒极了
The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.  it sounds wonderful.

弥林人觉得他们有个夜市
The Meereens think they have a night market.

我会亲自带您去看看
I will take you there myself.

抱歉我要失陪一会
Please excuse me for a moment.

马拉科说这雕像太重了没法带
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.

卡瓦罗说马拉科是个白痴
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.

他们可以把宝石挖出来 剩下的部分是纯金
They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold.

非常柔软 他可以砍下能搬走的部分
Very soft. he can chop off as much as we can carry.

我哥哥说过 多斯拉克人唯一懂得的事
My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do

就是把上等人建好的东西偷过来
Was steal things better men have built.

那可不是他们唯一会的
It's not the only thing.

他们杀起上等人来更在行
They're quite good at killing the better men.

我可不要做那种人的女王
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

我代表魁尔斯的巫师们
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,

请收下这块宝石 看看它
Take this gem. look at it.

靠近一点你就能从里面看到自己的身影 往往不只一个
Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.  often more than once.

您对札罗的便宜货和小玩意厌倦了吗 如果您能光临不朽之殿 我将感到无比荣幸
Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying.

我们永远期待您的到来
You're always welcome,

札罗·赞旺·达梭斯
'十三巨子'之一

俳雅·菩厉是十三巨子之一
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.

我只是出于惯例邀请他出席
It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.

在魁尔斯大家总是遵从惯例
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

什么是不朽之殿
What is the House of the Undying?

是男巫们阅读腐朽的卷轴
It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books

啜饮夜影之水的地方
And drink shade of the evening.

喝了之后他们的嘴唇变蓝 脑子糊涂
It turns their lips blue and their minds soft

迷糊到竟把
So soft, they actually believe

自己那些小把戏当成魔法
Their parlor tricks are magic.

熊岛的乔拉·莫尔蒙
Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

但她是龙之母
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

她比任何时候都需要真正的护卫
She needs true protectors now more than ever.

那些人会不分日夜登门造访
They shall come day and night

来观赏这重临人间的奇迹
To see the wonder born into the world again.

一旦他们看见
And when they see, they shall lust,

就会对这能焚毁一切的龙焰起贪念
For Dragons are fire made flesh.

那影子看起来像是史坦尼斯
It looked like Stannis.

对我来说它只是
To me it just looked like...

一个人形影子
A shadow in the shape of a man.

是史坦尼斯的人形
In the shape of Stannis.

明天我们就能到达我儿子的营帐
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

您会在那里常驻吗 夫人
Will you stay there long, My Lady?

我只打算把所见所闻告诉罗柏
Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.

然后就启程回临冬城
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

两个小儿子需要我
My two youngest need me.

我离开他们太久了
I've been away from them for far too long.

我从没见过我的母亲
I never knew my mother.

我的母亲因为难产而去世的时候
My own mother died on the birthing bed

我还很小
When I was very young.

太残酷了
It's a bloody business.

后来发生的一切更加艰难
What comes after is even harder.

一旦您安全回到自己的人民当中
Once you're safely back amongst your own people,

就准许我离开吗 夫人
Will you give me leave to go, My Lady?

你想杀史坦尼斯
You mean to kill Stannis.

但是史坦尼斯军容强盛
But Stannis has a great army around him.

他身边也有许多发誓守护他的侍卫
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

我绝不比他们任何一个差
I'm as good as any of them.

我当初就不该退缩
I should never have fled.

蓝礼的死不是你的错
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

你曾忠勇地为他效命
You served him bravely.

我只在他临死的时候
I only held him that once

要是你追随他一同赴死 你的侍奉就没有任何意义
You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.

蓝礼的敌人也是罗柏的敌人
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

我不认识您的儿子 夫人
I do not know your son, My Lady...

但如果您接受的话 我愿意为您效劳
But I could serve you if you would have me.

也许 那不是浴血沙场的勇气
Not battle courage, perhaps,

那是女人特有的勇气
A woman's kind of courage.

而且我相信一旦时机来临
And I think that when the time comes,

您一定不会强留我
You will not hold me back.

请答应我不会强行阻止我
Promise me that you will not hold me back

一旦时机来临 我绝不会强留你
When the time comes, I will not hold you back.

那我就是您的人了 夫人
Then I am yours, My Lady.

我会保护您的安全
I will shield your back

危难之际我愿奉献我的生命
And give my life for yours if it comes to that.

以新旧诸神之名 我郑重起誓
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

我起誓 你将永远在我家中拥有一席之地
I vow that you shall always have a place in my home

我誓言永不让你的服务
And that I shall ask no service of you

蒙上不誉的污名
That might bring you dishonor.

以新旧诸神之名 我郑重起誓
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

那可不光是小偷 大人
And it's not just thieves, My Lord.

山上现在都是狼
There's wolves in them hills now,

我从没见过这么多
More than i've ever seen.

他们在晚上闯入然后杀死我的羊

我身边现在没人能保护我的羊群了 只有我自己
I have no one to man my flock now. only me.

我可不能整日整夜地守着
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

我们可以派两个避冬市镇的孤儿跟你回去

帮你照看羊群
To help watch over your flock

如果你愿意为他们提供房间和面包

Hodor Bran. Lord Stark.

托伦方城被包围了
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

托伦方城离这儿只有四十里格远
Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.

兰尼斯特怎么能那么快打到北方来
How can the Lannisters strike so far North?

可能是魔山带领的一队骑兵
Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain.

也可能是泰温·兰尼斯特雇来的佣兵团
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

我们必须解救他们
We have to help them.

大部分能上战场的都跟着罗柏走了
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,

但我可以勉强凑上二百个人
But I can gather 200 decent men.

如果我们不能保护封臣
If we can't protect our own bannermen,

他们又何必保护我们
Why should they protect us?

去吧 罗德利克爵士 带上你需要的人
Go, Ser Rodrik. take the men you need.

我不会去太久的 大人
Won't take long, My Lord.

南方人在这坚持不了多久
Southerners don't do well up here.

那么 这预示了什么
So, what does it mean?

问你的鲁温师傅
Ask your Maester Luwin.

他不是一直在读书么
He's the one studying books all the time.

我是问过他 可他从没听过三眼乌鸦 那就什么也说明不了  你骗人
I did ask him. he'd never heard of a threeeyed raven.  must not mean anything, then. you're lying.

您可能会是我的小主人 但别说我骗人 你明明知道  我可从来没这么说过
You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.  you know what it means. I never said I didn't.

你没有如实回答我
You didn't give me an honest answer.

那和骗子可不一样
That's not the same as being a liar.

是吗 我看差不多
Well, it's not far off.

所以你再也没梦见过三眼乌鸦吗
So, you've been dreaming of a threeeyed raven again?

在神木林 你说你没有做梦
In the Godswood, you told me you didn't dream.

你在梦里看见了什么? 
What did you see in your dream?

我梦见一片汪洋包围了临冬城
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

我看见浪涛击碎城门
I saw waves crashing against the gates

盐水灌进墙内…
And the water came flowing over the walls...

院子里到处
Drowned men were floating here

罗德利克爵士也在其中
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

大海离这有好几百里呢
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

不过是个愚蠢的梦
It's just a stupid dream.

我得把这些土豆拿去厨房
I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

不然他们又要把我锁起来了
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

长城以北的人
What do they say about it

在长城以北 他们会说出各种各样的疯话
They say all sorts of crazy things North of the wall.

我看不大清楚
I don't see very well.

围绕火堆坐着的那些人可比咱们看得清楚多了
The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.

既然他们看见我们来了  火光就是个信号
When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal.

给曼斯充足的时间来和我们作战
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor.

他手下有多少野人? 
How many wildlings have joined him?

据我所知 全部的
From what we can tell, all of them.

就像鹿群对抗狼群一样 曼斯把他们集合在一起
Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.

他们几乎已经准备好采取行动了
They're almost ready to make their move.

我们既不能盲目冲击他们的包围圈
Can't just march into their midst.

也不能躲在一堆石头后面
And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile

坐以待毙
Of stones to protect us.

你是说我们应该返回长城? 
You saying we should fall back to the wall?

曼斯曾是我们的一员
Mance was one of us once.

现在是他们的人
Now he's one of them.

他会向他们传授我们的行事之道
He's gonna teach them our way of doing things.

他们会以武力发起强攻
They'll hit us in force.

即便我们狠狠回击 他们没那么容易善罢甘休
And they won't run away when we hit back.

他们会比从前更组织有序
They're gonna be more organized than before,

所以我们要伪装成他们
So we need to be more like them,

潜入内部 杀了曼斯
Sneak in, kill mance,

在他们能进攻长城之前
And scatter them to the winds

就让他们土崩瓦解
Before they can march on the wall.

我们就得脱下这身行头
We need to get rid of those lookouts.

这任务不需要四百多号人
It's not a job for 400 men.

要干得迅速和悄无声息
I need to move fast and silent.

哈克 石蛇 博尔巴
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

总司令大人 我请求加入科林大人的队伍
Lord Commander, i'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

我有过各种各样的诨名
I've been called lots of things,

但还是头回听人叫我科林大人
But that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

你是个事务官 雪诺 不是游骑兵
You're a steward, snow, not a ranger.

我和尸鬼交过手 还杀了一个
I've fought and killed a Wight.

有几个游骑兵有资格这么说? 
How many rangers can say that?

对 你是杀过个尸鬼
Aye. you killed a Wight.

但也被一个老头揍了个半死
You also let an old man

还被抢走了剑
Beat you bloody and take your sword.

为这孩子说句公道话 那家伙可是只难缠的老山羊
In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.

我能在琼恩离开后接替事务官的职务 司令官大人
I could take up jon's duties while he's gone, My Lord.

不会有问题的
It would be no trouble.

那好吧 我希望你做个优秀的游骑兵
Well, I hope you make a better ranger

比你做事务官要出色
Than you do a steward.

你的男仆恋上你多久了? 
How long has your manservant been in love with you?

他不是我的男仆 而且也没爱上我
He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me.

我总能看穿一个男人的欲望

那女人的欲望呢? 
And what about what a woman wants?

复杂多了
Much more complicated.

越过狭海  夺回铁王座
To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.

因为我向我的卡拉萨许诺会保护他们 并给他们找个家园
Because I promised my Khalasar i'd protect them and find them a safe home.

你为了多斯拉克人征服七国? 
You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

我想要七国 因为它们本就依法属于我
I want them because they're mine by right.

铁王座是我的 我会夺回它
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

那你又是如何得到这一切的?  谁给你的?   不
And how did you get all of this?  did someone give it to you? no.

像个货物一样被丢在码头
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

只不过 假如真是货物 还会有人关心
Except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.

所以那时你对拥有的一切并不满足
So you wanted more than you had and you took it.

你也算是个征服者 只是野心小一点
You're a conqueror, too. you're just less ambitious.

你的野心何在 札罗·赞旺·达梭斯? 
What do you want, Xaro Zhoan Daxos?

在城门口 你用血为我担保
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

这门与拱顶是由瓦雷利亚石打造
The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.

再锋利的剑也砍不出印子
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

我曾向魁尔斯最杰出的锁匠们提出悬赏
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth

如果谁能闯入就赐给他同体重的黄金
Their weight in gold if they could break into it.

我还将同样的赏赐许诺给最厉害的窃贼们
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

但他们统统空手而归
They all went home emptyhanded.

能开启此门的
The only thing that can open this door

都可以归属于我? 
And it can all be mine?

那也将远超购买马匹 舰只 军队的开销
More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies

这真是个浪漫的求婚
That was a romantic proposal.

我曾为爱有过一次婚姻
I've already married once for love,

但诸神将她从我身边夺去
But the Gods stole her from me.

双亲穷得连鞋都买不起
My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.

但你若答应嫁给我 我会将七国拱手奉上
But marry me and I will give you the seven kingdoms

我们的后代将成为王子与公主
And our children will be princes and princesses.

我的雄心远超过你的想像
I have more ambition than you thought.

事不宜迟 丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen,

劳勃·拜拉席恩已死
Robert Baratheon is dead.

如果你带着雇佣军跨过狭海
If you cross the sea with an army you bought

七国上下早已战乱四起
The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.

四位伪王在毁灭国家
Four false kings destroying the country.

要想赢回维斯特洛 你需要来自维斯特洛的支持
To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.

狼与狮子争斗不堪
The Starks fight the Lannisters,

而拜拉席恩则兄弟相残

就凭你那位割手为盟的新朋友
According to your new friend

信口开河的这么说? 
Who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

时不我待 我们急需舰队与军队
The time to strike is now. we need to find ships and an army

否则我们这辈子就只能困在世界的角落
Or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away

慢慢腐烂了
At the edge of the world.

富翁之所以富有 就因为他们不做赔钱买卖
Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.

他们给了你船与士兵 就从此掌控了你
They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever.

谨慎而行虽然艰辛但绝无差错
Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.

但我要在魁尔斯的门外
And if i'd listened to that advice

听从了这番建议 我们早就葬身荒野了
Outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.

我知道你把眼下这机遇看做最后希望
I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have,

别把我当小孩教训
Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

我只想  你只想什么? 
I only want what do you want?

把你送上铁王座 为了什么?   那本来就属于你
To see you on the Iron Throne.  why? you have a good claim.

你的头衔 你与生俱来的权利
A title. a birthright.

但你还拥有更高尚的东西
But you have something more than that.

即便你掩饰或是否认也好 但你的确拥有一颗仁慈之心
You may cover it up and deny it,but you have a gentle heart.

你将不仅仅会被尊重和敬畏
You would not only be respected and feared,

你就是那个命中注定 能力卓著的王者
Someone who can rule and should rule.

前无古人后无来者地
Centuries come and go without a person like that

出现在这个世上
Coming into the world.

有时候当我看着你
There are times when I look at you

仍不敢相信你是真实存在的
And still can't believe you're real.

那么作为我的顾问 你又有何良策? 
So what would you have me do as my advisor?

找到属于你自己的船只 只需要一艘就足够
Find your own ship. you only need one.

我们的盟友在维斯特洛 而非魁尔斯
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

那我又如何找到那艘船? 
And how do I get the ship?

我来替你找
I'll find it for you.

一艘好船 一位可靠的船长
A sound ship with a good Captain.

我期待见到他
I look forward to meeting him.

你应该侧身站
You should stand sideface.

侧面向敌 为什么?   更难被命中
Sideways.  why? smaller target.

我有说要跟别人打架么? 
Am I fighting someone?

你为战斗而练习
You're practicing for a fight.

那就该用正确的方式
You should practice right.

守卫!  来帮忙  你看见了什么? 
Guards!  help. did you see anything?

到上面去 看他从哪跌下来的
Go up there. go and see where he fell from.

都退后 他死了
Stand back. He's dead.

我拿下了你的城堡
I've taken your castle.

席恩?   叫我席恩王子
Theon?  It's Prince Theon now.

快起床 穿好衣服
Get up.  You have to get dressed.

我拿下了临冬城
I've taken Winterfell.

我拿下了它 占领了它
I took it. I'm occupying it.

我的人用钩爪和绳索登上城墙
I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.

为什么?   为了拿下城堡啊
Why?  To take the castle.

你和罗柏一起南下  之后他派我返回派克岛
You went with Robb.  And he sent me back to Pyke.

我姓葛雷乔伊 不能既为罗柏而战又为老爹而战
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both.

阿多在哪儿?   我不知道
Where's Hodor?  I don't know.

我的人会把你的人都带到院子里集合
My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.

好让你和我下去对他们讲话 告诉他们 你已经把临冬城献给了我  我不
So you and I can go down and tell them how you've yielded Winterfell to me.  I won't.

我决不 决不会投降
I won't.  I'll never yield.

我们会和你打 直到把你赶出去
We'll fight you and throw you out.

城堡是我的了 可人还是你的
The castle is mine, but these people are still yours.

只有投降才能保他们平安 保住他们的性命
You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive.

这才是一个好领主该做的
That's what a good lord would do.

仔细掂量掂量你该怎么说话
Think carefully about what you want to say.

难道你一直都这么恨我们? 
Did you hate us the whole time?

我代表临冬城向席恩投降
I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

我代表临冬城向席恩王子投降
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.

是啊 我们都认得你这坨冒热气的大粪
Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.

法兰 不要说话
Farlen, you be silent.

听你家小少爷的话 法兰
Listen to your little Lord, Farlen.

他比你懂事
He has more sense than you do.

你们所有人都要服从他的命令
All of you should do as he commands.

我父亲已戴上海盐与磐石的古老王冠 加冕为铁群岛之王
My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.

作为征服者 他同样有权占领整个北境
He claims the North as well by right of conquest.

你们都是他的臣民
You are all his subjects.

放屁 我只为史塔克家服务
Bugger that. I serve the Starks.

如果你以为凭这一小撮王八蛋就能占领北
If you think you can hold the North with this

只要像服侍奈德·史塔克一样忠心耿耿地为我服务
If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark,

我会像他一样好好待你们
I will be as good to you as he ever was.

谁敢怀有二心 我一定让他后悔
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.

鲁温学士 给派克岛送只乌鸦 向我父亲通报我在这里的战绩 再送一只给我在深林堡的姐姐
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here and one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.

通知她率五百人前来临冬城
Inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

你是学城的学士 曾立誓为临冬城的主人服务 不是吗? 
You are a Maester of the Citadel sworn to serve the lord of Winterfell, are you not?

正如布兰刚才向你们宣告的 现在临冬城的主人就是我
I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you.

你终于学会怎么和贵族说话了
I see you've finally learned how to address your betters.

我是这儿的俘虏
I was brought here a captive.

被抓那天您还在场呢
You were here the day I was taken.

是我抓的你 那又怎样? 
I'm the one who took you. What of it?

我要战士 不要厨房里的荡妇
I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

派我去厨房的是罗柏·史塔克
It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.

请让我再度挥使长矛吧
Put a spear in my hand again.

好让你把它插进我的脖子? 
So you can bury it in my neck?

你当我是傻瓜么? 
Do you take me for a fool?

这就是你的梦 小主人
It's your dream, Little Lord.

海水淹没了这里
The ocean has come to swallow this place.

我才不会让自己被淹死
I ain't letting it drown me.

几天之内我就  葛雷乔伊!
And in a few days' time Greyjoy!

他们把他怎么了? 
What have they done to him?

这家伙正从托伦方城赶回来 结果被我们逮了个正着
We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square.

为了夺下他的剑 我还折了两个人
Took out two of ours before I got his sword.

罗德利克爵士 很遗憾我们以敌人的身份重逢
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.

更遗憾你还不如后巷的妓女更有荣誉感
It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore.

你在这片屋檐下长大
You were raised here under this roof.

这些都是你的同胞  他们不是我的同胞
These people are your people.  They are not my people.

罗柏国王待你亲如兄弟
King Robb thought of you as a brother.

我的兄弟们都死了
My brothers are dead.

全被史塔克的手下杀了, 就是你这种人
They died fighting Stark men, men like you.

是啊 他们死在你老子亲手挑起的战争之中
Aye, they died fighting a war your father started.

史塔克大人将你和他自己的儿子们一起养大
Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.

一起养大 但从没把我当自己人
Among them, but not one of them.

我被从亲人身边夺走 当成人质
I was his hostage taken from my home.

如果他活着看到这一幕
If he were alive to see this

七国上下战火纷飞
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.

而临冬城是我的了
And Winterfell is mine.

我早该一剑刺穿你的肚子 而不是教你学什么剑
I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.

你对史塔克家族忠心耿耿 老东西
You've served this House faithfully, old man.

但是如果你不闭嘴 我就要
But keep talking and I'll

把他带到牢里 锁起来
Take him to the cells. Lock him up

王子殿下 不能饶了他 他必须付出代价
My prince, you cannot let that stand. He must pay.

他会在牢里关着直到烂成一滩
I'll lock him in a cell until he rots

不 他得赔付铁钱
No, he has to pay the iron price.

如果他活着 没人会看得起你
They'll never respect you while he lives.

我判处你死刑
I sentence you to death.

不! 你说过如果我投降 他们都不会受到伤害
No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.

谁让这老东西不闭嘴
The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

请你不要草率决定
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

他在我的部下面前侮辱我
He disrespected me in front of my men.

他自找的 与我无关
That was his decision, not mine.

他活着比死了更有用
He is worth more to you alive than dead.

求求你 席恩 仔细想想你在做什么
Please, Theon, think what you do.

记着叫我席恩王子 不然下一个死的就是你
You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.

判决死刑的人必须亲自动手
He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

求求你了!  懦夫
I'm begging you!  Coward.

停下! 快停下!
Stop! Stop right now!

你没权力下命令了 小少爷
You don't give commands anymore, Little Lord.

求求你 停下来 求你阻止他  安静 孩子
Please, stop this. Please stop him.  Hush now, child.

我要去见你父亲了
I'm off to see your father.

你保证过不会伤害他们!
You said no harm would come!

你保证过不会伤害他们 席恩 求求你
You said no harm would come. Theon, please.

还有什么要说的 老东西? 
Any last words, old man?

愿诸神指引你 席恩·葛雷乔伊
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.

你已经彻底迷失了
Now you are truly lost.

席恩 别 不要!
Theon, please, don't.

谁来阻止他啊  我什么都愿意做 求你了!
Do something.  I'll do anything. Please!

对 他不是
You're right, he's not.

你驯服不了野物
You can't tame a wild thing.

也不能信任野物
You can't trust a wild thing.

白灵不一样  那是你一厢情愿
Ghost is different.  So you think.

野物有它们自己的准则 自己的道理
Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons.

你永远不可能了解它们
And you'll never know them.

现在我们要找的野人 白天睡觉 夜晚打猎
Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.

'断掌'科林
守夜人游骑兵

我记得你刚才说野物不可能被了解
I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.

太阳升起 他们便找个洞穴藏身 夜晚到来 他们就开始杀戮
They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.

我们也可以这样做  不 我们不行
We could do the same.  No, we couldn't.

这是他们的国度
This is their country.

他们知道哪里能走 哪里不能走
They know where to walk, where not to walk.

曾经我有几个好兄弟就掉进了冰隙里 直到掉进去他们才发觉
I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.

我父亲总说我来自北境
My father always said I'm of the North.

我可不是玩笑  看看周围 小子
I wasn't joking. Look around, boy.

这里对你来说看起来像家乡么? 
This look like home to you?

你若是以为自己了解这里 那你就危险了
You start thinking you know this place, it'll kill you.

从未停息
We've always been at war.

永无尽头 因为我们面对的不是某个敌人
It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

而是整个北方 而北方是我们无法征服的
We're fighting the North and it's not going anywhere.

守夜人的身份对你来说是件幸事
The Watch has given you a great gift.

作为报答 你只需献出一件东西 就是你的生命
You only have one thing to give in return your life.

我很乐意奉献自己的生命
I'll gladly give my life.

我可不是让你'乐意'奉献生命
I don't want you to be glad about it.

我要你咒骂着 战斗着 直到你的心脏停止跳动
I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping.

而且记住 孩子 即使你为长城以南的人们献出生命
And know this, boy your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall.

他们也永远不会知道你做过什么
They'll never know what you've done.

不会知道你是怎么死的
They'll never know how you died.

甚至不会知道你他妈的叫什么名字 但正因为你这个无名杂种在长城外丢了性命 他们才能活下来
They won't even know your damn name, but they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

现在 你明白了吗? 
Now, do you understand me?

你心里比脸上看起来要无语多了
You're even dumber than you look.

孩子 这些话也就是那么一说 让我们在夜里能感到温暖一点 觉得自己不是在白费工夫
It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night, make us feel like we've got a purpose.

我们得在天黑之前找到那些混账野人 否则他们会抓到我们
We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.

你识字么?   大人? 
Can you read? My Lord?

这封信详述了我们的步兵动向 本应送到马尔布兰家的达蒙伯爵手里
This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.

却送给了多曼家的马林伯爵
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

非常抱歉 大人 我一定是
My apologies, My Lord. I must have

姑娘 把那本《七国主要贵族之世家谱系与历史》递给我
Girl, fetch me the 'History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses.'

我的侍酒识字都比你多
My cupbearer can read better than you.

这个多曼家族是向谁效忠的? 
To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?

效忠于临冬城的史塔克家族!
To the Starks of Winterfell!

他们有两万兵力 而且囚禁着我的儿子!
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

本来觉得除了虐待村民之外 你还能有点别的用处
I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants.

看来我高估你了
I see I overestimated you.

要是你胆敢再拿我儿子的命开玩笑 我就
If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll

姑娘 把书放回去
Put the book away, girl.

也许我们下一场战斗该让你来出谋划策
Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.

培提尔·贝里席伯爵到了  嗯
Lord Petyr Baelish. Hmmm.

君临有什么新闻? 
What news from the capital?

我是直接从蓝礼·拜拉席恩的营地过来的
I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.

啊 先王蓝礼
Ah, the late king Renly.

好一个短命国王
Rather a short reign.

听说死在一个女人手里
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

也有人说这事情颇有些蹊跷 也许是某种黑暗的力量作祟
There has been talk of other forces at work, dark forces.

当雄心壮志受挫的时候 人们总是喜欢归咎于魔鬼
Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.

我相信混乱的时局 总是会带来转瞬即逝的机遇
It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.

你以为你是第一个想到的么? 
You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it.

没错 危机即是转机
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

你今天来还有什么深刻见解想要对我说的? 
What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?

除了兰尼斯特和史塔克家族 提利尔家族的军事力量最强大
After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host.

他们有七国里最肥沃的土地 兵强马壮  是啊 是啊 是啊
Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers. Yes, yes, yes.

蓝礼死后 提利尔还未效忠其他任何一位国王
The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.

Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death.

提利尔家族曾举兵反抗铁王座 反抗我的外孙  话虽如此

我见过一个野人宁可咬舌自尽头也不回答问题

你叫什么?   耶哥蕊特
What's your name? Ygritte.

你靠近她时 她正要去抓斧头
She was reaching for this axe when you got to her.

你若慢半拍 早被她砍翻
Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.

你们应当火葬死者

那我们就得生一堆大火
We'd need a big fire for that.

告诉我 耶哥蕊特 为什么让我们生起大火? 
Tell me, Ygritte, why do you want us to build a big fire?

Are there some more friends in the area?

烧了他们 除非你想再杀一次

Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.

要我动手么?   别
Want me to do it? No.

这儿交给他了
We'll leave him to it.

我们在山顶等你来会合
We'll meet you at the top.

我们已经深入他们的老巢了
We're deep in their country now.

你从没杀过女人 对不对? 
You never killed a woman before, did you?

你不必杀我
You don't need to do it.

曼斯会收留你 我知道他会
Mance would take you. I know he would.

那些乌鸦永远抓不到我们
The Crows would never catch us.

我和他们一样都是乌鸦
I'm as much a Crow as they are.

完事之后 你会...  烧了我? 
Will you burn me...  after?

烟雾会被发现

我要你知道 爱一个人是什么感觉 真爱一个人是什么感觉 然后我便把她从你身边夺走
I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone, before I take her from you.

你就像只小猫一样 喵喵哭着找妈妈

我见过你哭  你刚才说什么了么 小姐? 
I saw you cry. Did you say something, My Lady?

我离开临冬城那天我弟弟哭了

桑铎·克里冈
'猎狗' 御林铁卫

我们有过暴君也有过庸王 但是我们还从来没有倒霉到有你这样 又残暴又愚蠢的国王
We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

你胆敢  我当然敢 我就这样
You can't  I can, I am.

他们往你身上扔牛粪 你就要把他们都杀光?
They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all?

他们在挨饿 你这笨蛋
They're starving, you fool.

一切皆因你引发的这场战争
All because of a war you started.

你在和国王说话!
You're talking to a king!

我还打了国王
And now I've struck a king.

我的手从手腕上掉下来了吗?
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

史塔克家的女孩呢?
Where is the Stark girl?

如果她死了 你就永远也见不到你詹姆舅舅了
If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back.

你欠他的可多着呢 你知道么
You owe him quite a bit, you know.

你被操过吗 小姑娘?
You ever been fucked, little girl?

带几个人去把史塔克家的女孩找来
Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.

我只接受国王的命令

没事了 没事了  走这边
We'll get you. We'll get you. This way.

你受伤了吗 小姐?
Are you hurt, My Lady?

小小鸟在流血
The little bird's bleeding.

来几个人带她回笼子里 治疗一下伤口
Someone take her back to her cage, see to that cut.

我又不是为了你
I didn't do it for you.

他不该让我等着
He shouldn't make me wait.

香料之王是全魁尔斯第二富有的人
The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth.

所有人都得等着他
He makes everyone wait.

当然 你本可以避免这样的尴尬 只要你嫁给魁尔斯第一富有的人
Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.

我已经有丈夫了
I already have a husband.

卓戈卡奥已经不在了 卡丽熙
Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.

您这么年轻 又这么美丽 不该做一辈子寡妇
You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.

你还真聪明啊 以为这些花言巧语就能说服我
And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.

我活了这么一大把年纪 可以算得上阅女无数 可没见过哪个不爱花言巧语
I have travelled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.

龙之母!  噢
The Mother of Dragons!  Ah.

请您原谅 我昨晚做了噩梦
Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.

直到阳光闪耀 小鸟鸣叫 我才睡得着
I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing.

洗去红色荒原的旅尘后 你是多么漂亮的一个可人儿啊
Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you.

我对先前发生所有不愉快的事感到抱歉
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.

一位真正的银发坦格利安
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.

札罗·赞旺·达梭斯 站在你这么一个从码头爬出来的家伙身边 她显得太过可爱了
Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.

是啊 但是他们说你那个赶着马车卖胡椒的祖父 却最终娶到了 一位远比他可爱并且出身高贵的女士
Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.

世上任何一位女士 只要是活的 都比我祖父更可爱 并且出身高贵
Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather.

我的仆人难道没给你们提供些吃的喝的? 
Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink?

我该让他们在广场受鞭刑
I'll have them flogged in the square.

实在感谢 大人 您待客十分宽厚 但是没有一位仆人能带来我想要的
Thank you, My Lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.

噢 她演戏可真有天分 就凭这一点
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

嗯 我的小公主 你想要的是什么呢?
So, my little princess, what is it you want?

生来就属于我的 维斯特洛的七大王国
My birthright the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

这件事情我恐怕跟仆人一样无能为力
I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard.

我没法给你不属于我的东西
I cannot give you what I do not have.

我向你要的不是王国
I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms.

我向你要的是船
I'm asking you for ships.

我需要渡过狭海
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

我同样需要我的船
I need my ships as well.

你也知道 我要用他们 载着香料奔波于一个又一个港口
I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.

待我夺回铁王座 你所给予我的任何东西我都三倍奉还
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.

你以前坐过铁王座吗?
Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?

我父亲被杀害之前曾坐在上面
My father sat there before he was murdered.

但如果你自己未曾坐在上面的话 难道不应该纠正为夺取吗?
But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne?

我不是来这里辩论语法问题的
I didn't come here to argue grammar.

当然不是 你是来夺取我的船的
Of course not. You came to take my ships.

那么让我说明一下我的立场 小公主
So let me explain my position, little princess.

我可没你那么好的家世
Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.

我要靠贸易谋生
I make my living by trade.

依照利润来判断每一笔交易
And I judge every trade on its merits.

你说我能得到三倍的回报
You say I shall be repaid triple.

我并非怀疑您的诚实或是意图
I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions.

但是不攻下七大王国 你就无法偿还这笔债
But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

你有军队吗?   还没有
Do you have an army?  Not yet.

你连军队都没有
You do not have an army.

那你在维斯特洛有强大的盟友吗?
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

维斯特洛有许多人支持我的事业
There are many there that support my claim.

你上次在那里是什么时候? 
When were you there last?

我还是个婴儿的时候就离开那里了
I left when I was a baby.

那么 实话说 就是没有盟友了
So, in truth, you have no allies.

待我回归 人们会揭竿而起
The people will rise to fight for their rightful

请您原谅 我的小公主 我可不能仅仅为了愿望和梦想就投下巨资
Forgive me,little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams.

现在请您允许我离开
Now if you'll pardon me.

你可知道潘托斯的总督 伊利里欧·莫帕提斯? 
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,Magister of Pentos?

是的 我们见过面 是个狡猾的人
Yes, we've met.A shrewd man.

在我的婚礼上他给了我三颗龙蛋化石
For my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs.

他相信 整个世界都相信 岁月已经将它们化作了石头
He believedthe world believed that the ages had turned them to stone.

人们已有多少年未曾看到过龙在天空中翱翔? 
How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies?

但我梦见过 梦见如果我带着这些龙蛋 步入一场熊熊烈火当中 它们便会孵化
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch.

当我真的步入那场火中 我的子民都以为我疯了
When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad.

但是当火焰燃尽
But when the fire burned out,

我却毫发无伤 这就是龙之母
I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.

我并非寻常女子
I'm no ordinary woman.

我十分欣赏你的热情
I admire your passion.

但在商业上 我更相信逻辑 而非热情
But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.

我很抱歉 小公主
I'm sorry, little princess.

我可不是你的小公主
I am not your little princess.

我是风暴降生的丹妮莉丝 有着古老的瓦雷利亚血统 我会夺得属于我的东西
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria and I will take what is mine.

夺得他们 用血与火
With fire and blood, I will take it.

好吧 女士 但别用我的船
Yes, My Lady, but not with my ships.

谁教你识字的? 
Who taught you to read?

我也教过我儿詹姆认字
I taught my son Jaime to read.

有一天学士来找我 跟我说他没有学
The Maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning.

他记不住字母
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

拼写什么的一团糟
He reversed them in his head.

学士说他听过这种怪病 建议我们只能听之任之
The Maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it.

在那之后 我让詹姆 每天练字四小时 直到学会为止
After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned.

他因此而恨过我一段时间
He hated me for it, for a time.

很长一段时间 但他学会了
For a long time, but he learned.

你父亲在哪儿?  还活着吗? 
Where is your father? Is he alive?

认字的石匠? 
A stonemason who could read?

嗯  他自学的
Hmm.  He taught himself.

你可真是个牙尖嘴利的小东西 嗯? 
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

抱歉 大人 我不该问问题的
Forgive me, My Lord. I shouldn't ask questions.

但你已经问了开头
But you've already begun.

你了解你的父亲吗 大人?
Did you know your father, My Lord?

我看着他一点点变老
I watched him grow old.

他是个好人 但也是个软弱的人 一个差点毁了家族名誉的懦夫
He was a good man, but a weak man, a weak man who nearly destroyed our House and name.

我去为火堆添点柴 大人
I'll fetch more wood for the fire, My Lord.

你去哪儿 小丫头? 
Where are you going, girl?

泰温大人给的
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

他让我拿到军械库去
To take to the armory.

他干嘛要这样做? 
Why would he do that?

走 我们去问问
Let's go and ask him.

女孩给了我第二个名字
A girl has named a second name.

某人定会完成任务
A man will do what must be done.

女孩不能限定时间
A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing.

时辰未到 某人不能下手
A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.

但是他要去通知泰温了 他已经走了
But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away.

陛下  陛下
Your Grace.  Your Grace.

尊敬的陛下
My honor, Your Grace.

我不确定我算不算小姐
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

我还不是很熟悉维斯特洛的风俗
Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.

那些庞杂的规则的确难以记忆
It's hard to keep all the rules straight.

不过若我没记错的话 贵族出身的女性通常被称作小姐 除非 她是女王 或者公主
But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady unless she's a queen or a princess.

我可以找到了解这些的人
I could find someone who knows.

你怎么这么肯定我是贵族出身? 
Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

这很明显
Because it's obvious.

如果我告诉你我父亲是在桥边卖缎带的小贩 而我和母亲 兄弟一起住在我们的商店上面呢? 
What if I told you my father sold lace on the long bridge and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?

一个真正的贵族可不会指责淑女的不实
Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.

我一直认为我是个骗术高手
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

恐怕还是您的截肢技术更高明一些
Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

我们会在这里停留很久么? 
Will we be here long?

我不能跟您讨论关于军队行进的问题
I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.

奸细当然不会承认自己的身份
Of course a spy would deny being a spy.

说得没错 被你发现了
You're right. You've found me out.

我在给兰尼斯特写信
I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.

或许你能与我同行
Perhaps you'd join me

当然 如果你有空的话 呃
If you've got time,of course, for, well

母亲 这是泰丽莎小姐
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

她一直在照顾伤员
She's been helping with the wounded.

她非常的 乐于助人
She's been very...helpful.

请原谅 我从未听说过这个姓氏
Forgive me,I do not know this name.

在这确实不常见 这是瓦兰提斯的古老姓氏
An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis.

不好意思 夫人 陛下
Excuse me, My Lady. Your Grace.

是啊 你看起来不大自在
Yes, you look positively forlorn.

还不是因为你突然出现
You surprised me, that's all.

真没想到今天就能见到你
I didn't think I'd see you today.

我希望你能自由自在地生活
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.

但你继承了你父亲的责任心
You have inherited your father's responsibilities.

而这意味着一些代价
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

我明白  你已经订过婚了 那是一项应尽的义务
I know.  You are promised to another a debt that must be paid.

我没忘  陛下
I haven't forgotten.  Your Grace.

夫人 临冬城来信
My Lady.News from Winterfell.

你的兄弟们抛弃你了? 
Your brothers desert you?

我可以为你指条明路
I can tell you which way to go.

天色太黑了 难以前行
Too dark to go any farther today.

这? 这里无处安身
Here? There's no shelter here.

哪里都无处安身
There's no shelter anywhere.

会有的 只要你知道如何寻找
There is if you know where to look.

我们俩都会被冻死
The cold could kill us both.

如果能生堆火  不能生火
If you light a fire No fire.

但是火能  不能生火
But a fire isNo fire.

靠近点 我们才能保暖
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

我敢打赌肯定是你先冻死
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

你觉得他们出来找你了? 
Think they're out looking for you?

是的  你觉得他们会找到你? 
Yes.Think they'll find you?

天一亮我们就出发 先睡会儿
We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

我只是想找个舒服的姿势
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

你还动! 我有么? 
You're still moving.  Was I?

我没注意啊
I didn't notice that time.

我们接到了从白港
We've had ravens from White Harbor,

荒冢屯和恐怖堡的来信
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

恐怕这是真的
I'm afraid it is true.

因为葛雷乔伊家都是叛逆的婊子
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

我的弟弟们呢?   还没有他们的消息
My brothers?  We've heard nothing of them.

但是我们收到了罗德利克·凯索的死讯
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

我早就说过 永远不要相信葛雷乔伊!
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

我必须立刻返回北境
I must go North at once.

战事未尽 陛下
There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

要是连自家城堡都守不住 我还算哪门子的国王? 
How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle?

我要如何得到部下的追随 当自己连
How can I ask men to follow me if I can't

这意味着你无须事必躬亲
And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.

让我去与席恩谈判
Let me go and talk to Theon.

不会有什么和谈 他必将为此付出生命的代价
There will be no talk. He will die for this.

席恩守城的人寥寥无几
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

让我给我在恐怖堡的私生子捎个信
Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort.

他能带领几百人在新月之前夺回临冬城
He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.

我们还要对付兰尼斯特
We have the Lannisters on the run.

如果现在回师北境 那就前功尽弃了
If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained.

我儿子会很荣幸为您带回席恩的脑袋
My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.

告诉你儿子 布兰和瑞肯的人身安全才是最重要的
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount.

至于席恩 我希望能活捉他
And TheonI want him brought to me alive.

我要盯着他的双眼 问他为什么要这样做
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.

然后我将亲自将他斩首
And then I'll take his head myself.

我怎么会相信你这样野人小骗子呢? 
Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?

野人都是骗子和蛮子 对任何人都没有任何忠诚可言
All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

我只是为了活命罢了
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

我跟你一样憎恨史塔克
I hate the Starks as well as you do.

让我来服侍您吧 大人
Let me serve you, My Lord.

怎么服侍? 别跟我说你手能持矛 为我战斗
How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.

我还有其他方式 大人
There are other ways to serve, My Lord.

我现在可是王子了 你可得好好的
I'm a prince now,and you'd do well

我还有其他方式 王子殿下
There are other ways to serve, my prince.

我们自由人 懂得
We know things,the Free people.

我总想尝尝 你那下面的滋味如何
I always wondered what you had under there.

我没杀你 这就是条件
I'm not killing you. That's your price.

除了你这不堪的生活 你还想要什么? 
What do you want, then, other than your miserable life?

所有自由人都渴望的 自由
What all free people want my freedom.

好吧 只要你服侍的不错
Well, you shall have it, then.

你会得到的
But only if you serve me well.

还好不是很深  我还以为他们会杀了我
It's not deep. I thought they were going to kill me.

他们是这样想的
They thought so, too.

打我的那个人 他恨我
He hated me,the man who hit me.

从他的眼神中 我能看到憎恨
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

他从来没见过我 可是他想伤害我
He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.

他当然想  为什么 为什么一个陌生人会 你有他永远不会拥有的一切
Of course he did. Why? Why would a stranger you are everything he will never have.

你的马比他孩子吃的还好
Your horse eats better than his children.

不过现在无所谓了 他已经死了
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

如果有面包的话 我会给他们的
I would have given them bread if I had it.

我比他们任何人都更恨国王
I hate the King more than any of them.

别说这些了
Don't say these things.

如果被不合适的人听见了
If the wrong people hear you

但是你不是什么不合适的人啊
But you're not the wrong people.

这样才比较安全
Life is safer that way.

你要去哪里? 
And where are you going?

席恩王子让我带点东西给你
I have something for you from Prince Theon.

他让我挨个伺候过来
He says I'm to make the rounds.

香料之王拒绝了我 他觉得我是个糟糕的投资对象
The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment.

丝绸之王也不会支持我 因为他还要跟兰尼斯特做生意
The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters.

干嘛要得罪他最好的客户呢? 
Why offend his best customer?

而黄铜之王愿意为我提供一艘船 条件是我得陪他睡一晚
And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night.

难道他觉得一艘船就能让我跟婊子一样出卖自己吗? 
Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

来到这个城市时 我一无所有
When I came to this city, I had nothing.

我只能睡在码头边
I slept by the docks.

若我能找到搬运工的工作 就能果腹
And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat.

如果没有 连食物都是奢望
If not, I dreamed of food.

如今我是魁尔斯最富有的人
Today I am the richest man in Qarth.

你认为从贫困到富裕的路途 始终是纯洁而荣誉的吗? 
Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable?

我做了很多事 卡丽熙 很多会被正直的人所不齿的事情
I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn.

然后我才能有今天 但我并不后悔
And here I am, with no regrets.

封锁大门 敲响警钟
Bar the gates. Ring the bells.

我的龙在哪儿? 
Where are my dragons?!

你让一个残废逃跑了? 
You let a cripple escape?

那男孩走不了路 就这么在你眼皮底下溜走了? 
The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?

一定是那个巨人带着他
The giant must have took him.

噢 妙 这就更妙了
Oh, well, that's all right, then.

你让一个弱智带着一个残废溜了
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

还有瑞肯吧? 那个小不点
And Rickon, too? The little one?

都跟着那个女野人跑了 你昨晚正忙着操她
Gone along with the wildling woman, the one you were fucking.

好了 备马 带上猎狗
Right, get the horses and the hounds.

快 找他们的气味
Come on, find the scent.

快 他们往哪走了? 
Come on, where they going?

喜欢你的第一次狩猎吗? 
Enjoying your first hunt?

大人 目前看来 狩猎跟骑马没什么两样
So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, My Lord.

只要追猎下去 最后都会见血
With hunting, there's blood at the end.

当年我被人从家里抢走带到这里的时候 也只是个小孩
I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here.

如果能够尽快找到他们 我就不动他们
If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.

好吧 可能我会动他们 但不会下杀手
Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

对你来说 那两个男孩活着比死了有用得多
Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.

但找不回来人 就什么用都没有
They have no value to me missing.

罗柏不久就会派人前来夺回临冬城
Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.

罗柏远在河间地 我姐姐近在深林堡
Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

她赶过来要快得多
She'll get here long before they do.

而奈德·史塔克常说 用五百人
And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold

就能把一万人挡在临冬城之外
Winterfell against 10,000.

猎狗找到踪迹了
The hounds have the scent.

来吧 学士 别这么阴郁
Come, Maester, don't look so grim.

这不过是一场游戏
It's all just a game.

我们应该多带点食物
We should have took more food.

去厨房太冒险了
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

那些人都爱戴你
Those people all love you.

不论你需要什么 他们都会给的
They would have given you whatever you needed.

席恩发现之后 会把他们全部吊死
And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

小子 吃核桃填不饱肚子  别管我
The boy can't survive on walnuts. I'm fine.

天还没亮我们就动身了 一直到现在
We've been walking since before sunrise.

就算是阿多都会累  阿多
Even Hodor will tire. Hodor.

说你呢 可爱的巨人  阿多
Even you, sweet giant.  Hodor.

等一下 我知道这个农场
Wait, I know that farm.

我曾派过两个临冬城的孤儿到这儿来
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

他们会给我们食物的
They'll give us some food.

如果席恩搜到这里 他会拷问他们 直到问出我们的去向
If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.

比利能爬树呢 爬的比谁都好
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

小主人 那是因为你没见过我爬树
You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

他们会带着猎狗追踪我们
They'll be after us with hounds.

我们动身比他们早 但还是摆脱不了猎狗
We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.

你昨晚没用刀在我身上磨磨蹭蹭? 
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

你不是第一次把你的棒子 顶在一个女人的屁股上吧
Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's ass.

噢 还真是第一次
Oh, it is the first time.

小子 你多大了? 
How old are you, boy?

我是守夜人的汉子
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

你是个没碰过女人的小毛孩
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

你的卵蛋难道不疼吗?  如果你的棒子从来不
Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets

别这么叫它们
Don't call them that.

我听说如果你不让它们发挥作用 就会肿胀发紫 有擦伤的可能
I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them.

当然啦 可能只是那些家伙乱编的 他们想在我这博同情
Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them.

然后就以为我真的会同情他们
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

你们那儿没有女乌鸦吗? 
Are there no girl crows?

没有 守夜人里没有女人
There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

所以小伙子们就互相解决? 
So the lads just do it with each other?

长城上还有绵羊? 
You have sheep at the Wall?

噢 那就是用手了? 
With your hands, then?

难怪你们个个苦大仇深
No wonder you're all so miserable.

能不能请你闭嘴? 
Would you please shut up?

能不能请你闭嘴? 
Would you please shut up?

你觉得你比我高贵 乌鸦
You think you're better than me, crow.

我是个自由人  你是个自由人? 
I'm a free woman  You're a free woman?

我可能是你的犯人 但我是个自由人
I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.

如果你是我的犯人 你就不是自由的
If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman.

这就是'犯人'的意思
That's what 'prisoner' means.

那你觉得你是自由的? 
And you think you're free?

你发了个愚蠢的誓 然后再也不能碰女人
You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.

我的誓言是我自愿选的
It was my choice to say the words.

你不喜欢女人?   我当然喜欢女人
So you don't like girls?   Of course I like girls.

但你选择了再也不碰她们
But you chose never to touch them.

要成为守夜人的汉子 这就是代价
That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

所以你宁愿放弃睡女人的自由 跑来侵略我们的地盘
So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands

是野人一直进犯我们的领地
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

有几个还曾想杀掉我的小弟 一个残废的男孩!
Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!

那不是你们的领地!
They're not your lands!

从古至今 我们一直都在这儿
We've been here the whole time.

是你们擅自跑过来 建起一堵大墙 说地是你们的
You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.

我的父亲乃是奈德·史塔克
My father was Ned Stark.

我身上流着先民的血液
I have the blood of the First Men.

我的祖先们住在这里 和你的祖先一样
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

那你们为什么还要来攻打我们? 
So why are you fighting us?

来跟我说说到底发生了什么
Now I want you to tell me what happened.

Come on, speak up. Speak up.

附子草 这东西很罕见
Wolfsbane a rare substance.

这不是一个普通刺客

我们昨晚吊死了二十个人
We hanged 20 men last night.

你们吊死一百个我也不管
I don't care if you hanged 100.

有人想杀了我
A man tried to kill me.

我只要他的名字 和他的脑袋
I want his name and I want his head.

我们觉得可能是无旗兄弟会 派来的奸细
We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.

这群土匪起名字还真是自命不凡
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

我们决不能容忍眼皮子底下有人作乱 频频滋扰却不能得到惩治
We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity.

我们像是傻子 他们却好像英雄
We look like fools and they look like heroes.

国王都是这么被推翻的
That's how kings fall.

我要你全部清理干净
I want them dead, every one.

杀了他们不难
Killing them isn't the problem.

克里冈 你变软弱了吗? 
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

我一直视你为天生的猛夫

让他们知道选错阵营意味着什么
Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.

我马上拿其他食物过来
I'll bring something else.

我一会去厨房吃
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

拒绝领主的赏赐 太没规矩了
It's bad manners to refuse a Lord's offer.

以年龄来说 你个子小了点
You're small for your age.

一定从小到大都没吃饱过
I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.

只是不长个  嗯
I just don't grow. Hmm.

这会是我的最后一场战争 输赢成败 在此一举
This will be my last war, win or lose.

你以前输过吗? 
Have you ever lost before?

如果曾经输过 你觉得我还能坐在现在的位子上吗? 
Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?

但这场战争才会令我铭记于史
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

他们叫它'五王之战'
The 'War of Five Kings'they're calling it.

接下来的几个月 将铸就我的传奇
My legacy will be determined in the coming months.

你知道传说的意思吗? 
Do you know what legacy means?

就是你会教给孩子 一代又一代传下去的东西
It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children.

只有它们能在你死后流传下去
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

'黑心'赫伦以为这座城堡会是他的传奇
Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.

这座古往今来最雄伟的要塞 最高耸的塔楼 最坚固的城墙
The greatest fortress ever built the tallest towers, the strongest walls.

大厅里曾有三十五个壁炉
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

现在你看看它 满目疮痍
Look at it now a blasted ruin.

你知道发生过什么吗? 
Do you know what happened?

对 龙来了
Yes, dragons happened.

赫伦堡建立之初只考虑防御陆上的威胁
Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.

即便是百万雄师来袭 也无法撼动它半分
A million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been repelled.

但遇上从空中来袭的龙焰 嗯
But an attack from the air with dragon firemm.

赫伦和他所有的儿子都在城里被活活烧死
Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.

所以直至今日 在他死去三百年后

伊耿和他的妹妹们
Aegon and his sisters.

骑龙而来的不止是伊耿

It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

看来学过不少历史 是么? 
A student of history,are you?

Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

我打小就知道这些

维桑尼亚·坦格利安是个伟大的女战士
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

她有一把瓦雷利亚钢剑叫黑暗姐妹
She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.

她是你心目中的英雄 对不对?

大部分女孩不是更爱把自己幻想成 那些歌谣中的美丽少女? 
Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?

头上缀满鲜花的琼琪?

谁教你的这些 关于维桑尼亚和她的黑暗姐妹? 
Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword?

他是个满腹经纶的石匠
He was a wellread stonemason.

他是这么告诉你的? 
Is that what he told you?

杀戮才是世上最美好的事
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

你为何总是这么可恶?

One of them did this or knows who did.

你也是其中之一
You are one of the Thirteen.

如果我要你的龙  早就拿走了
If I wanted your dragons,I would have taken them.

单单拿走它们对我而言毫无意义  毫无意义? 
They mean nothing to me on their own.  Nothing?

它们远比世上任何一样东西都更重要
They're more valuable than anything in the world.

是不是要去我的地下室看看 世上还有什么 是我卖了你的龙才能买来的? 
Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already?

我们会找回它们的
We will get them back.

根本没有什么'我们' 你为什么要帮我把它们找回来? 
There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?

我在我的地盘上 当着大家的面赌誓保护你
I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.

我才不管你经历过什么
I don't care where you've been.

因为不住在石头城堡里 你就认为我们是野蛮人
You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.

如果有人要告诉我们 男人和女人不该躺在一起 我们会朝他屁眼里插根矛
If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his ass.

靠继承老爹王位而来的狗屁国王 我们才不要服从
We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.

不 不 你们服从曼斯·雷德 塞外之王

曼斯·雷德是我们推举出来的领袖
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

She admired your spirit,Your Grace.

如果每个人都要 为自己每一个远亲的举动负责

她把协议撕成两半了 陛下
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

非常感谢
You've acted with honor.

Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean.

再给他一顿热饭

我只认识一个 就是我哥哥 而他情愿让一千个人上了我 只要能给他戴上王冠
I only knew onemy brother, and he would have let 1,000 men rape me if it had got him the crown.

这世上 没人能独立生存
No one can survive in this world without help.

请让我来帮助您 求你

还要多久才能找到你的乌鸦队伍? 
How long till we get back to your crows?

是么 一天? 还是半天? 
What, a day? A halfday?

其实你也不知道 不是么? 
You don't know, do you?

你连他们在哪都不知道吧  就快到了
Do you even know where they are? We're close.

你觉得他们会如何评价咱俩的事情? 
What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?

咱俩之间什么也没发生
Nothing happened between you and me.

我发誓 老乌鸦大人 我们只是靠在一起取暖而已
'I swear it, old master king crow, Ser, we were only close together for warmth.

然后我觉得 有个棍子一样的东西顶着我的屁股
And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club.

您看看 我的尾骨都被它挫伤了
I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

我还没弄清楚那究竟是什么呢 他 他 他的那话儿完全漏在外面 怒气勃发
And before I knew what was where, hishis well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.

我本来忍着想要拒绝 可是 哦 我真是情不自禁
And I didn't want to want it, but, oh, I did!

接着他分开我的双腿 一切都完了
And he spread me legs andruined.

现在我再也无法嫁给一位香喷喷的领主大人了
Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.

我那可怜的野人老爹会怎么说呢
What will me poor savage father say?'

当我以为事情结束了的时候 他却说
'And I thought that we were done, but he said,

我告诉你 琼恩·雪诺 从我们用剑互砍的时候开始 从你每次跟我说话就脸红开始 我们就应该像刚才说的那样
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow, since it's going to be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just.

什么 就在这烂泥地上? 
What, right here in the muck?

我会为你取暖
I'll keep you warm enough.

你就这么害怕? 
Are you that afraid of it?

很美妙的 又湿又暖
Oh, it's nice and wet and warm.

够了 我下面可不会咬人
Enough it don't have teeth.

你早该抓住机会要我的
Should have took me while you had the chance.

没事的 给我
It's all right.Give me that.

如果被太后知道我已经可以为乔佛里生孩子…
If the queen sees I can have Joffrey's children now...

帮我把它翻过来
Help me flip it over.

你去哪儿  去告诉太后
Where are you going? To tell her Grace.

你永远不会告诉任何人
You'll say nothing to anyone.

你母亲应该早就教过你
Your mother might have prepared you.

你成人了 亲爱的 仅此而已
You flowered, my dear.No more.

我母亲是说过 但是我没想到会是这样
My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.

我以为不会这么 这么脏乱
I thought it would be less less messy.

等生孩子的时候你就知道了
Wait until you bear the child.

你知道这意味着什么吗? 
Do you have any idea what that means?

我可以为国王生育了? 
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

为国王诞下小王子和小公主 这可是你期待已久的事情 这是身为王后的最高荣誉
A prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.

乔佛里一直很难伺候
Joffrey has always been difficult.

从他出生就是如此 我用了一天半的时间才生下他
Even his birth,I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world.

你根本无法想象那有多疼
You cannot imagine the pain.

毫无疑问 劳勃在御林都能听见
I screamed so loudly, I was sure

我声嘶力竭的喊叫
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

陛下当时没有跟您在一起吗? 
His Grace was not with you?

每次我临近产期 我尊贵的丈夫就带着他的猎人和猎狗 躲在树林里玩乐
Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds.

归来时 他会向我展示些 皮毛 鹿头什么的 而我 则给他一个婴儿
And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby.

不过必须声明 我也不想他在身边
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

我有派席尔大学士和一队助产士 还有我弟弟
I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

他们告诉詹姆不能进产房 他只是微笑着问道 你们有谁敢阻拦? 
When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.

乔佛里可不会对你投入这么多感情
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

你也许永远不会爱上国王 但是你会爱上他的孩子
You may never love the king, but you will love his children.

我全心全意地爱着陛下
I love his Grace with all my heart.

这话听着真感人
That's so very touching to hear.

既然今天如此特殊 我愿意跟你分享一些女人的智慧
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.

爱的人越多 你就越脆弱
The more people you love, the weaker you are.

你会为了他们而冒天下之大不韪
You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.

只要他们能够平安快乐 就算像个傻瓜也在所不惜
You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.

除了你的孩子 谁都不要真心去爱
Love no one but your children.

在这方面 作为母亲别无选择
On that front, a mother has no choice.

但是…难道我不该爱乔佛里吗 陛下? 
But... shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

你可以试试 小白鸽
You can try, little dove.

你刚才说你妈是谁来着? 
Who did you say your mother was again?

呃 也许她是比别人大那么一点点
Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she

不 不 兰尼斯特家只有一个胖子
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

如果她是你妈 你就应该知道这个
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

我 我当过一次您的侍从 记得吗? 
II squired for you once, you know?

在威廉·弗雷婚礼的比武大会上
The tournament the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

我去过威廉·弗雷的婚礼? 
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

您的侍从在前一晚喝的烂醉如泥
Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he

他在去比赛场地时 从马背上摔了下来
He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds.

他叫什么来着? 布莱恩
What was his name? Bryan.

我弟弟干得好事 我好像有点印象了
That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.

之前你根本没有做过侍从
You had never squired for anyone before.

是的 我跑去主动请缨
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.

我父亲当时反应非常激烈 生怕我会在整个家族面前 令自家蒙羞
My father was furious, afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the family.

您真的记得?   嗯
You really remember? Mm.

你知道什么时候该出现 什么时候又该消失
You knew when you were needed and when to go away.

我的其他侍从 他们的出发点是好的 但心比天高的年轻人 总是做的太过
Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.

每当我回想起来
Well, when I think back to that day

我 算了 这可真尴尬
I never mind. It's embarrassing.

难道还能比栓在沾满自己大便的栏杆上 更尴尬吗? 
More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?

那天的事情我仍历历在目 您的头盔 您的战马 就在栅栏旁泥地上的标线 您把巴隆·史文爵士敲下马 太阳正在天空照耀 当您把盾牌交给我时 我还清晰的记得那上面的凹痕
I remember everything about that day your helmet, your horse, the rake line in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.

这些事情我都至死难忘
I'll remember it all until I die.

那是我人生中最棒的一天
That was the best day of my life.

我还记得在比赛结束后我仍站在场上
And I remember being on the field after it was over.

所有的参赛者都回去了
All the competitors were done.

我是最后一个留在那里的
I was the last one out there.

我无法离开
And I couldn't leave.

我无法回去和家人坐在一起 回到宴席之中的那张 几乎看不到新娘的偏僻的小桌旁
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride.

我无法告诉他们做你的侍从究竟是什么感觉 因为他们对我所说的一切 根本一无所知
And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.

我完全理解
I understand completely.

对 对不起 我 我没有 怀疑您的意思
Ssorry, II didn't mean to doubt you.

我只是 我  我也曾有过十六岁
It's just that II was 16 once.

我也曾临时代人去做某人的侍从
I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.

那是一场对抗御林兄弟会的战斗
The fight against the Kingswood outlaws.

他是个 画家 只用红墨作画
He was a painter, a painter who only used red.

我简直难以想象自己能像他那样战斗 起码当时不行
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then.

甚至连为他的完美杰作锦上添花 都很困难…
And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect...

我无须向你描述那种感觉
I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.

那实在是难以言喻
It's hard to put into words.

就像步入一个梦境 一个你从记事起就从未停止幻想的梦境 并且发现它甚至 比自己的生命更真实
It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.

离开那个战场之后 日子天天像坐牢一样难受
Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.

您后来还有给他当侍从的机会吗? 没有
Did you squire for him again? No.

我并没有你那样的天赋
I didn't have your gift.

后来我糟糕的服侍让他寸步难行
He couldn't take a step without stepping on me.

糟糕透顶 我得为此负全责 直到有一个御林土匪 决定挑战一个十六岁的侍从
I was awful, a complete liability...  until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16yearold squire.

这也不错 我就是我
It's a good thing I am who I am.

在别的方面我一直很没用
I'd have been useless at anything else.

我可不适合当俘虏
I'm not wellsuited for imprisonment.

奈德·史塔克 我觉得他 到死都是个称职的俘虏
Ned StarkI imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end.

而我嘛 我生来就不该 受到任何约束
But me, thoughmy life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.

你有没有想过…? 
Have you thought about...?

显然 犯人态度良好的话狱卒当然也不会差
Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.

史塔克们非常小心
The Starks are very careful.

但我相信 总会有办法的
But there is a way, I think.

现在终于有机会了
It wasn't possible until now.

其实很简单  那我来帮你
It's actually quite simple. Well, let me help you.

你只需要做一件事
You'll only have to do one thing.

这个人必须出海渡过古瓦雷利亚
This man must sail past old Valyria.

每个走近末日遗迹的人都需要保护
All who travel too close to the Doom must have protection.

我不是来这里听你念叨的
I didn't come here for lessons.

确实 你是来找龙的
No, you came for the dragons.

看看这块破铁管什么用
See what your steel is worth.

你想要取悦龙之母
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

龙在哪儿? 
Where are the dragons?

你会再次背叛她吗 安达尔人乔拉
Will you betray her again,Jorah the Andal?

你会再次背叛她吗? 
Will you betray her again?

你所追查的窃贼 此刻正在她身边
The thief you seek is with her now.

我离开自己舒适的居所来到您堂前 可不是让你当我是个贼的
I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.

没人说你是窃贼啊
No one is calling you a thief.

那她指控我什么呢? 
Who is she to accuse us?

求您 他们是我的孩子啊
Please, they're my children.

我恳求你们 恳求我们? 
I'm begging you. Begging us?

你不久之前才刚刚威胁过我们
It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.

没有我在身边 小龙们会死的
Without me, the dragons will die.

那样再好不过了
It will be for the best.

你的龙只会为这个世界带来死亡和悲惨 别无它物啊 亲爱的女士
Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear.

即便我知道它们在哪里 也不会告诉你
If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.

你太残忍了 我的朋友
You are cruel, my friend.

龙之母应当和她的孩子们重新团聚
The mother of dragons is in the right.

这可是天经地义的啊
She must be reunited with her babies.

我会帮助您的 卡丽熙  怎么帮? 
I will help you, Khaleesi. How?

我会带您去不朽之殿 小龙们就被我放在那里
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.

当得知您正赶往我们的城市时
When I learned you were coming to our city,

我便同魁尔斯之王达成了协议
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

他帮我得到了那些小龙
He procured them for me.

但魁尔斯并没有王啊  现在有了
But there is no King of Qarth. There is now.

那就是协议的另一半
That was the other half of the arrangement.

你们选择紧闭城门 对墙外之事不闻不问 可是如果魁尔斯拒绝改变的话 它怎能作为古往今来最伟大的城市长存
You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.

我会为整个世界敞开魁尔斯之门 正如我曾经强迫它对我敞开一样
I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.

你的雄心壮志听起来倒是振奋人心
Your ambition is an inspiration.

可惜和其他暴发户一样 你狂妄过头了
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

三只猫咪大小的龙 再加上与牛鬼蛇神结为同盟 靠这些你就想成为王? 
Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.

暴发户和牛鬼蛇神? 
An upstart and a charlatan?

帝国的缔造者往往比这更加微不足道
Empires have been built by less.

圈外的人不时插足权势中心 而中心的人就得腾出位子 不管他情愿不情愿
Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.

龙之母将会同她的孩子们在一起
The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.

她会付出她的爱 而它们将在她的身边茁壮成长 永不分离
She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side...  forever.

母亲应当同她的孩子在一起
A mother should be with her children.

风暴降生的丹妮莉丝 您这是要去哪儿? 
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

您的小龙们都在不朽之殿等着呢
Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.

史塔克夫人! 不许再靠前
Lady Stark! No farther.

把手拿开 女人
Keep your hands off me, woman.

别不请自来 男人
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

请您见谅 史塔克夫人
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

怎么了?   他们抓到了弑君者
What is it? They caught the Kingslayer.

宰了这混蛋弑君者!  吊死他!
Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!

为卡史塔克讨回公道
Justice for the Karstark.

都靠边! 我要他的脑袋!
Get back! I want his head!

谁敢阻止一个父亲的复仇 我就连他一起杀
Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.

卡史塔克大人 此人是我们的囚犯
Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.

这个怪物杀了我儿子
This monster killed my son.

他会为自己的罪孽付出代价的
He will answer for his crimes,

我向你保证 但不是在这里
I promise you, but not here.

我要砍他的脑袋 如果您想要阻止我的话
I will have his head. And if you try and stop me

你就连我一起砍? 
You will strike me down?

你忘记我是谁了吗 爵士? 
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

我是你誓言效忠的领主 艾德·史塔克的遗孀
I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddark Stark.

我是你效忠的国王的母亲!
I am the mother of your king!

那我们的国王在哪儿?   你自己很清楚
And where is our king now? You know very well.

他前往峭岩城去受降了
He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.

对 去峭岩城 但不是去谈判
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.

他把那个外国婊子也带去了
He brought that foreign bitch with him.

威胁夫人可是叛国之举
Threatening My Lady is an act of treason.

杀兰尼斯特竟然算是叛国之举? 
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

我理解你的悲伤 大人 我比任何人都更加理解 但是以吾儿之名 以北境之王之名 罢手吧
I understand your grief, My Lord better than most I understand it but in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.

您儿子回来时
When your son returns,

我会向他索要这个凶手的脑袋
I will demand this murderer's head.

明智之人不会向国王索要任何东西
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

但爱孩子的父亲会
Fathers who love their sons do.

我一定要他的脑袋
I will have his head.

感谢您拼死捍卫我的利益 史塔克夫人
Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.

本来应该是由我保护您的 可惜
I would have come to your defense, but

把他扔回牢里
Take him to the stockades.

用所有你们能找到的链子锁住他!
Bind him with every chain you can find!

您如今倒是真的成为一匹彻头彻尾的母狼了
You've become a real shewolf in your later years.

没剩多少'鱼'的部分了
There's not much fish left in you.

你从什么时候起开始亲自点灯了? 
Since when do you light your own candles?

自从我发觉就连看一会我的贴身侍女 都无法忍受时起
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.

那封信你到底还要读几遍才罢休? 
How many times can you read one raven scroll?

探子侦察到史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的舰队正在北上 越过塔斯 带着二百艘船
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth200 ships.

比我们的船多  没错 比我们的多
More than we have. Yes, that's more than we have.

他五天之内就会攻进我们的城门 如果风向有利 就只需四天
He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.

我们有高大坚固的城墙
We have strong, high walls.

我们会从上面朝他们下火雨
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

你在照搬父亲的话 对吧? 
You're quoting father, aren't you?

他长于策略 不是么? 
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

那是战略 而非策略
We call it tactics, not strategy.

好吧 没错 他的确擅长那些
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

有些人可能会说 他是最擅长的
The best mind, some would say.

遗憾的是 他并不在这里
Sadly, he's not here.

这里只有你 我 和乔佛里 七国统治者 全境守护者
It's just you, me, and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm.

我相信你最终还是能够切入正题的
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

他必须开始变得像个国王了
He needs to start acting like a king.

这场你们掀起的战争已经打到咱们的门口了
This war you started is coming to our doorstep.

然而如果整座城市都想要乔佛里死
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead

我可没给那孩子妓女让他虐待
I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.

我以为那些姑娘们能帮帮他
I thought the girls might help him.

你真这么想?   我失算了
Did you? I was wrong.

如果我们无法控制他
If we can't control him...

你觉得我从没试过吗? 
Do you think I haven't tried?

他根本就不听我的话
He doesn't listen to me.

当你给小狗带上王冠之后 再想拿链子拴住它就不太容易咯
It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.

我一直希望他能变得像詹姆
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

他外表倒是很像… 在光线合适的时候
He looks like him...  in a certain light.

这孩子比起詹姆更像劳勃
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

劳勃是个醉酒的蠢货 但他从不以残忍之行为乐
Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

有些时候我觉得…
Sometimes I wonder...

这就是对我们的所做所为 对我们的罪孽的惩罚
If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.

兄妹通婚了几百年
Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years,

每当我和詹姆动摇时 我们就会这样安慰彼此
That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.

奈德·史塔克愚蠢地对我摊牌时 我也是这么说的
It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.

半数的坦格利安都疯了 不是吗? 
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

每当一名坦格利安降生 诸神便抛出一枚硬币
Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.

你战胜了那个谣言
You've beaten the odds.

托曼和弥塞菈都是像样的好孩子 两个都是
Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.

还等什么?   我们宣誓效忠国王
Why wait? We're sworn to the king.

国王不在  那可是叛国之举
There's not a king. That's treason.

所以就要保护兰尼斯特 是吗? 
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

你们统统退后  不 我不会
Back off, you. No, I won't.

您儿子黎明时分归来 夫人? 
Your son returns at dawn, My Lady?

弑君者估计活不过今晚
The Kingslayer won't last the night.

他们喝得越多 怒火就越盛
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

一旦那些卡史塔克们真的拔了剑 谁会乐意为保护兰尼斯特而送命? 
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...  who wants to die defending a Lannister?

让我和他独处一会
I need to be alone with him.

夫人 我们的命令是  你们的命令就是我刚刚下达的 留我和他独处
My Lady, our ordersyour orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.

来道别的吗 史塔克夫人? 
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

我猜这大概是我在世上的最后一晚了吧
I believe it's my last night in this world.

你听到他们在那边说的话了吗? 
Do you hear them out there?

呵 老卡史塔克大人看起来不怎么喜欢我
Well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

你用链子把他儿子勒死了
You strangled his son with your chains.

就是那个值班的守卫? 
Was he the one on guard duty?

所有骑士都会这么做
Any Knight would have done the same.

你几乎背弃了自己发下的每一条誓言
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

他们让你一次又一次地发
They make you swear and swear.

捍卫国王 服从国王 服从你的父亲 守护无辜之人 保护弱者
Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak.

但要是你的父亲轻视国王呢? 
But what if your father despises the king?

要是国王滥杀无辜呢? 
What if the king massacres the innocent?

不管你怎么做 迟早不是犯了这条便是叛了那条
No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.

这怪胎你是从哪儿找来的? 
Where did you find this beast?

她是个比你优秀百倍的骑士 真正的骑士
She is a truer Knight than you will ever be,

敬坦格利安家族的伊里斯二世
Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name,

七国统治者 全境守护者 敬我刺入他背后的宝剑
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.

你真是个毫无荣誉感的人
You are a man without honor.

除了瑟曦 我没有过别的女人
I've never been with any woman but Cersei?

比你那可怜的死了的老奈德更有荣誉感
I have more honor than poor old dead Ned.

他生的杂种叫什么名字? 
What was the name of that bastard so in he fathered?

布蕾妮  不 不对
Brienne. No, that wasn't it.

雪诺 北境的私生子
Snow, a bastard from the North.

那么 当 当好人老奈德 将某个妓女的孩子带回家时 你有没有假装爱过那杂种? 
Now, whenwhen good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it?

不 你不太擅长做戏
No. You're not very good at pretending.

你是个诚实的女人
You're an honest woman.

你恨那男孩 对吗? 
You hated that boy, didn't you?

你怎么可能不恨他? 
How could you not hate him?

他的一举一动 一言一行无时无刻不在提醒你 那个荣誉至上的艾德·史塔克公爵 睡了另一个女人
The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddark Stark fucked another woman.

我告诉过你们后果
I told you what would happen.

我告诉你们忠诚的侍奉能得到什么… 以及背叛会换来什么
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally...  and what would happen if you did not.

可你们打算怎么做?  你们又都做了什么? 
What are you doing? What have you done?

如果仍旧有人在你们的新领主下令时 提出质疑
If there's any who still question whether your new lord means what he says...

这就是答案
Here is the answer to your question.

骑兵进城! 打开城门!
Rider approaching! Open the gate!

看哪 临冬城亲王登场喽
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

好个吃飞醋的女人, 吃什么? 
Envy isn't attractive. What envy?

你该为你弟弟的胜利感到骄傲
You should be proud of your brother's achievement.

只用二十个人 我便拿下了临冬城
I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.

好个伟大的战士
You're a great warrior.

我瞧见你挂在城门上的尸体了
I saw the bodies above your gates.

不知道哪个更难料理些 跛子呢 还是六岁小孩? 
Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the sixyearold?

我以荣誉之道对待史塔克的小崽子 但他们用背叛作为回报
I treated the Stark boys with honor and they repaid me with treachery.

你所谓的荣誉之道就是屠戮他们? 
You treated them with honor by butchering them?

杀他们之前 我对他们 占据他们的家 这是你的权利
Before I had to kill them, I treated them you seized their home, as is your right.

我们是铁种 强取一切想要的, 正是
We're Ironborn; We take what we need. Exactly.

你将他们囚禁在他们自己家里 结果他们溜了
Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.

他们承诺过
They made me a promise

你的小囚犯们给了你承诺 他们不照办 你就失心疯了? 
Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it?

哪个婊子像你这么愁人的? 
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

别叫我, 婊子
Don't call me aA cunt.

愁死人的蠢婊子杀了临冬城里仅有的两个史塔克
A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.

你难道不知道这两个孩子的价值吗? 
You know how valuable those boys were?

如果我不杀他们 全北境都会把我看成懦夫
If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.

你就是懦夫 外加蠢材
You are weak. And you're stupid.

接着说啊 警告我啊
Go on, then, warn me.

你带来的人太少了
You haven't brought enough men.

就这么点人 你要我怎么守城? 
How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?

没人要你守城 我是来带你回家的
You're not. I've come to bring you home.

父亲想和你谈谈, 你在开玩笑? 
Father wants a word. Is this a joke?

临冬城是北境的心脏
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

啊 是啊 离大海有几百里呢
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

宝贝小弟 我们是铁民
We're islanders, baby brother.

你是不是忘得一干二净了? 
Had you forgotten that?

我们的力量源自我们的长船
Our power comes from our ships.

何况你用史塔克男孩的尸体 装饰你的城墙 是个北方佬都想看着你被吊死
And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged.

如果罗柏・史塔克知道
When Robb Stark finds out

他不会知道 我们杀光了乌鸦
He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens.

马也都在我们手上
We have all the horses.

我拿下了临冬城
I've taken Winterfell.

我就要守住临冬城
And I will keep Winterfell.

席恩 我们是血亲骨肉
Theon, you're my blood.

有着同一位敬爱的母亲
We both loved our mother.

同一位严苛的父亲
We both endured our father.

和我回家吧 别独自客死他乡
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

我没打算要死
I don't intend to die.

你知道吗 你从婴儿起就很讨厌
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

哭个不停 从不睡觉
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

有天晚上 你怎么也不肯闭嘴 叫得像只快死的猪
And one night you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig.

我走到你的摇篮边 看着你
I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.

我想掐死你
I wanted to strangle you.

而你突然停止哭叫 抬头看着我
And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.

不要死在离大海这么远的地方
Don't die so far from the sea.

骸骨之王 我给您带礼物来了
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

耶哥蕊特
野人 '火吻而生'

乌鸦我有了 不需要两只
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

曼斯会想审问这一只的
Mance will want to question this one.

他知道其余乌鸦的藏身处和计划
Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.

科林
守夜人游骑兵 '断掌'

断掌知道的更多 这只不过是小孩
The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy.

他本可以杀我十几次
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

现在他肯定后悔了 宰了他
And now he wishes he did. Gut him.

他是临冬城奈德・史塔克的杂种崽子
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

曼斯要死人的杂种做什么? 
What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?

我想他会要亲自裁决
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

他敢跑 我就割了他的蛋
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

他敢跑 我亲自下手
He runs, I'll do it meself.

我们扯平了 琼恩・雪诺
We're even now, Jon Snow.

我都把剑架到她脖子上了 我就是不能
I had the sword at her neck, I just couldn't

你没能返回 我们就去找你
When you didn't come back, we went looking for you.

找到你的踪迹花不了多久
We found your tracks fast enough.

但在找到你之前 他们发现了我们
But they found us before we found you.

他们因我而死
They died because of me.

不能让他们白白牺牲
See that it wasn't for nothing.

站起来 快
Come on, on your feet, now.

我不知道她的名字
I don't know her first name.

我敢肯定 您会很幸福的
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

您是为了过一座桥娶的她吗? 
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

那桥很关键, 噢
An important bridge. Ah.

那时他们还没杀害我的父亲
It was before they killed my father.

我还以为只要过了桥 就能及时南下救他脱困
I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.

我会和北境人聊到您的父亲 他们都爱戴他
When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.

Too close to Casterly Rock.

他分出一部分兵力 打算夺回临冬城

葛雷乔伊帮了我们很大的忙
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.

在聚齐全部兵力之前 史塔克不会冒险进军凯岩城
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.

他还是个从未打过败仗的小子

你已经不需要再偷偷溜进巷子里了
Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer.

你应该正大光明的站出来

干嘛? 干嘛? 你干嘛一直盯着我?

你又不让我清理手指甲

We talked about this. Aye, we talked about it.

你见过被包围的城市会变成什么样吗? 
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

你那些书里大概没有这个

要知道 大多数人并非死于战斗

鉴于这种情况 大人
Given the circumstances, My Lord,

我想应该授权守备队采取一些极端措施
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

可惜大学士谢瓦尔森不是个好作者

他知道哪里的城墙最坚固 他也知道哪里最容易攻破
He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest.

攻城锤几分钟内就能攻破 而且离黑水河只有五十码
A good ram will batter it down in minutes and it's only 50 yards from the water.

他一定会在这里登陆
That's where he'll land.

如果史坦尼斯真的进攻烂泥门 我们有何计划? 
And if Stannis does attack the mud gate, what is our plan?

我们可以拿书扔他们
We could throw books at his men.

我们没有那么多书

断掌科林也是活着的最伟大的游骑兵
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.

问题是伟大的游骑兵不会活到老死
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

只有平庸的人才会活得久
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

七层地狱啊 这是什么? 
What in seven hells is that?

这是守夜人的斗篷
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

在这埋了很久了
It's been here a long time.

哦 这一定是龙晶
Oh, must be Dragonglass.

学士们把这个叫做黑曜石

And they left me with my little brother.

他们走后的第二天 是三年的长夏里最热的一天
The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the threeyear summer.

我们在屋里热得受不了 就跑去洛恩河消暑
We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

那天 瓦兰提斯所有的孩子都在洛恩河玩耍
Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.

富人 穷人 我们都聚集在一起 大家都赤裸着 大笑着 竞相往小岛游去
The rich, the poor, we were all there, naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

鼓手们在东岸击鼓助威
Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.

当时我踩着水 和朋友聊天 突然我发现弟弟不见了
I was treading water, talking to a friend when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

接着呼唤变为了哭喊
Then I started screaming his name.

终于 我看到他了 面朝下 浮在水面
And then I saw him floating facedown.

我的心跳… 瞬间停止了
My heart just... stopped.

我把他拽上来
I dragged him from the water.

也许我朋友也帮我了吧
My friend helped me, I think.

我都记不清了
I don't even remember.

我们把他拖到河岸上 对着他哭喊 摇他的肩膀 可是他死了
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank...  and I screamed at him and I shook him and he was dead.

他脸上有鱼形的纹身
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

在瓦兰提斯 只有奴隶才有纹身 这样就算不问 你也能清楚他们的身份
In Volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them.

这个人就是为一艘渔船服务的
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

他一把将我推开
And he pushed me out of the way.

你得明白 若是一个奴隶敢推开贵族女孩 就意味着死亡 可怕的死亡
You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl that's death for the man, a terrible death.

但是他将我推开 然后开始按压弟弟的胸膛 一而再 再而三 直到我弟弟把半条洛恩河 都吐了出来 直到他能哭喊出声
But he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out.

那个男人摸着他的头安慰着他
And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.

那天 我做了两个决定
I decided two things that day.

我不会再把自己的青春 浪费在贵族小姐的假面舞会上
I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

等到成年
And when I came of age...

我也必将远离那些奴隶城邦
I would never live in a slave city again.

我很抱歉 陛下
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

您向我诉说您的困境 我却只是沉缅于旧日的回忆之中
You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.

我不想和那个佛雷家的女孩结婚
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

我也不愿看到你和她结婚
I don't want you to marry her.

但你需要佛雷家的桥
But you needed that bridge.

我希望那是座非常美丽的桥
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

捣烂的酸樱桃都准备好了
The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.

或许已经在馅饼皮里了
Probably in the piecrust by now.

在烤炉里 温暖的烤炉里
In the oven, the nice warm oven.

闭嘴 你带了些什么过来? 
Shut up. What did you bring?

我要是拿奶酪就好了
The cheese could be better.

虽然香肠也不错
I did get some nice sausages.

他想让我们拿那些守卫怎么办? 
What did he want us to do about those guards?

他只是说 '穿过那座大门'
He just said, 'walk through the gates.

那守卫怎么办? 
What about the guards?

他没说守卫怎么办
He didn't say anything about the guards.

什么 他把这事给漏了么? 
What, he left that bit out?

这是挺重要的一部分 不对吗? 
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

我们必须相信他, 相信他? 
We have to trust him. Trust him?

你相信他能帮我们打 就放他走了 然后他就不见了, 我想回厨房去
You trusted him to fight with us and you set him free and he ran. I want to go back to the kitchens.

闭嘴 如果你害怕了 就留在这里
Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

只要风不停 我们明天就能到君临
If the wind holds, we'll reach King's landing in a day.

我不能替风向您保证 陛下
Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

我尊敬你 戴佛斯爵士
I admire you, Ser Davos.

谢谢您 陛下 承蒙您的夸奖
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

有些贵族傻瓜叫你洋葱骑士 而且以为这是侮辱你
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.

你就真的把洋葱作为你的家徽 绣在你的衣服上 画在你的旗子上
So you take the onion for your Sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

我儿子希望我能把它改掉
My son wishes me to change it.

改成三条拿着三叉戟的人鱼 诸如此类
Three mermen with tridents, something like that.

我理解为什么那些古老的家族都看不起我
I understand why the older families look down at me.

我父亲是个捕蟹人, 还有呢? 
My father was a crabber. And?

唔 领主的儿子不愿意和捕蟹人的儿子共餐
Well, sons of Lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers.

那么 当风息堡内忧外困的时候 他们在哪里? 
And where were those Lords when Storm's End starved?

有很多在为令兄奋勇征战
Many fought bravely for your brother.

也有不少在为疯王打仗
Many fought for the Mad King.

你为那些背后羞辱过你的人辩护
You defend these men who insult you behind your back.

有些人喜欢当着我的面羞辱我
Some are happy to do it to my face.

劳勃和奈德・史塔克 他们才是英雄 伟大的反叛 一场接一场的战斗 把无数城镇从疯王的压迫中解救出来 而我则率五百人守护风息堡
Robert and Ned Starkthey were the heroes, the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

没有人忘记过您 陛下, 没有么? 劳勃忘了
No one has forgotten, Your Grace. No? Robert did.

战后他把风息堡给了蓝礼
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.

蓝礼从未打过仗
Renly never fought a day in his life.

那为什么劳勃把风息堡给了他? 
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

首先是马肉
First we ate the horses.

城堡被围困 马匹已无用武之地
We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded.

与其让马饿死 还不如宰了吃肉
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

然后是猫肉 我从来没有喜欢过猫
Then the cats. Never liked cats.

所以轮到猫了 我喜欢狗
So fine. I do like dogs.

不过我们照吃不误 然后是老鼠
But we ate them. Then the rats.

在你摸进来的前一晚
The night before you slipped through,

我妻子已经快不行了
I thought my wife was dying.

她说不了话 非常虚弱
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.

然后你穿过了封锁线
And then you made it through the lines.

黑色小船装满了洋葱
Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.

应该还有土豆和咸牛肉
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

那一夜 风息堡的每个人都恨不得亲你一口
Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.

幸好他们没有那样做
I was relieved they did not.

劳勃告诉我要守住风息堡 而我做到了
Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.

然后他说要把它交给蓝礼 我也照办了
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up.

不管这是侮辱还是别的什么 我照办了 因为劳勃是我的长兄 是国王 我永远都会尽我应尽的责任
Insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty.

但现在 依照所有维斯特洛的律法 我才是正统的国王
But now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.

当我坐上铁王座的时候 你会成为我的首相
And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.

我必将忠心侍奉您
I pray I serve you well.

你将是第一个佩戴这枚徽章的捕蟹人之子
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.

你是情报总管
You're the master of whisperers.

你理应知道所有的事情
You're supposed to know everything.

没有人能在同一时间出现在所有地方
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

我在北境安插了不少人手 陛下 但是自从席恩・葛雷乔伊控制了临冬城 我就再也没听到他们的消息
I have many little birds in the North, My Lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

史塔克家族的精力被分散了
The Stark forces are distracted.

现在是发起进攻的时刻了
Now is the time to strike.

我亲爱的外甥 你不是也看到了 这些人在修的城墙是防守用的
My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege?

你不是知道史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩的舰队马上就到了么? 
You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

如果我的史坦尼斯叔叔在君临的海岸登陆
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing,

我将亲自前去问候他
I'll ride out to greet him.

真是一个勇敢的决定 陛下
A brave choice, Your Grace.

我很确定你的人马会紧紧跟在你的身后的
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

他们说史坦尼斯从来不笑
They say Stannis never smiles.

我会给他划一个红色的微笑 从左耳根到右耳根
I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.

想象一下史坦尼斯的恐惧吧
Imagine Stannis's terror.

你是个聪明人
You're an intelligent man.

不谦虚地说 我也是个聪明人
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

哦 大人 此事毋庸置疑 即使是平时轻视你的人也不会怀疑
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.

我希望我们两个聪明人能收起谎言 好好谈谈
I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.

乐意之至
I wish we could, too.

要玩游戏的话 得从你开始
If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

我哥哥是史上最年轻的御林铁卫
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.

我姐姐十九岁就成为了王后
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

而当我成年的时候 我的父亲任命我 看护凯岩城的给排水系统
When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

一位高贵的水管工
A most highborn plumber.

管道从来没有那么畅通
The water never flowed better.

所有的粪便都顺利排进大海
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

我从来未曾妄想过得到任何实权
I never expected to have any real power.

所以当父亲任命我为代理首相的时候
So when my father named me acting Hand

你很适合当御前首相 你知道么? 
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

琼恩・艾林和奈德・史塔克都是好人 值得崇敬的人 但是他们鄙视这个游戏 鄙视它的玩家
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men, honorable men, but they disdained the game and those who played.

而你玩得很开心, 没错
You enjoy the game. I do.

这是我最不期望见到的事情
Last thing I expected.

你还是个好玩家
And you play it well.

我希望能继续玩下去
I'd like to keep playing it.

如果史坦尼斯冲破了城门 游戏就结束了
If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.

听说他会把敌人活活烧死 以向光之王致敬
They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.

光之王希望他的敌人被烧死 淹神则希望他们被淹死
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the drowned God wants them drowned.

为什么神灵都是这样邪魔般的存在? 
Why are all the Gods such vicious cunts?

怎么就没有酒和色的神明呢? 
Where is the God of tits and wine?

在盛夏群岛 人们信奉一位有十六个乳头的生育之神
In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

我们应该立即去那里
We should sail there immediately.

今天早上我听到了一首歌儿 从红色荒原那头的魁尔斯一路传来
This morning I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安还活着
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

我们没空理会一个远在世界尽头的女孩
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.

她还有三头龙
She has three dragons.

但即使传说是真的 幼龙成长起来还需经过漫长的岁月
But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown.

但当它长大之后 我们就无处躲藏
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

没法同时下两盘棋 朋友
One game at a time, my friend.

这座城市属于札罗 男巫们有一千双眼睛 在注视着你
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1,000 eyes watching for you.

我找到一条 一条船 还有个好船长
I found one a ship with a good captain.

她明天就要去往阿斯塔波
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

阿斯塔波?  我们不能在这里停留
Astapor? We cannot stay here.

他们夺走了我的龙
They have my dragons.

一个母亲不能丢下自己的孩子独自逃离
A mother does not flee without her children.

它们不是你的孩子
They're not your children.

我知道他们都叫你龙之母 我也知道你爱它们 但它们不是你生的
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb.

它们也未曾吮吸过你的乳汁 它们是龙 卡丽熙
They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi.

如果留在魁尔斯 我们都会死
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

你去阿斯塔波好了 那里很安全
You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.

你知道我会为你而死
You know I would die for you.

我永远不会抛弃你
I will never abandon you.

我已发下誓言 永远保护你 服从你
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

如果我的龙在不朽之殿 就带我去那里
If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.

那就中了男巫的圈套
That's what the warlock wants.

他也让你去那里
He told you so himself.

如果你进入不朽之殿 就永远不要妄想能离开
If you enter that place, you will never leave again.

他的魔法很强大, 那我的魔法呢? 
His magic is strong. And what of my magic?

你曾见过我步入火焰
You saw me step into the fire.

活活烧死那女巫的火焰 可曾伤到我? 
You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me?

我到死都不会忘记
Until my last breath I will remember.

就算我已忘记了母亲的脸庞也还会记得
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

它们是我的孩子
They are my children.

而且它们是我一生中仅有的孩子
And they are the only children I will ever have.

不如再多挂几天
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.

对那些脑袋不开窍的人 挂多少天都没用
If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help.

但是多挂一会也没啥
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

他的事儿了结了
His troubles are done.

他被剁了作肥料
He's feeding the crops now.

想要人不说话 就得让他永远闭嘴
You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.

逃到乡野之外 再折返回来
Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.

涉过小溪来摆脱猎狗的追踪
Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.

但愿他们永远不要想起这里
Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.

现在看来 一切如你所愿
You're right...  so far.

城门上挂着的 是谁的尸体? 
Who was that out there hung up the gates?

肯定是那农夫的孩子
Must have been the farmer's boys.

他杀了他们 烧了他们的尸体 然后假装他们就是小王子? 
He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?

布兰会为此而自责的
Bran would blame himself.

他们永远不会从我口中得知这些
They'll never hear it from me.

这两个小家伙承受的痛苦够多了
The little lads have suffered enough.

潮汐对我们不利
The tide's against us

是 但风向对我们有利
Aye, but we have the wind

足以送我们直抵城门
She'll blow us straight to the gate.

我离开君临这家已有二十年之久
King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.

大半辈子都在跟王家舰队躲迷藏
I spent most of my life dodging the Royal Fleet.

现在却要与他们正面交锋
And now I'm sailing right at them.

我们就是王家舰队
This is the Royal Fleet.

你也不再是走私者了 你是王家舰队总司令
And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.

现在的王家舰队可不止一个
Of course there are several Royal Fleets at the moment.

过了今晚就不是了 当太阳升起之后
Not after tonight. When the sun rises,

史坦尼斯会坐上铁王座 你会当上首相
Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.

父亲 一个真神 他看顾着我们
Father, there is only one and he watches over us.

但不看顾他们?  他看顾着所有人
But not over them? Over all of us.

君临的百姓不会支持伪王
The people of King's Landing did not choose the false King

他们很乐意看到他的头被插在枪上
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

不管怎么说 我们得先把他的头砍下来才行
Well, first we have to put it there.

我们的船是他们的十倍
Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one.

我们的人马是他们的五倍
Our army outnumber theirs five to one.

君临城从没被攻破过
Those walls have never been breached.

而守城的那些人 可不会把你当解放者
And the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator.

在他们眼中 你是想要烧毁他们城市的陌生人
They see a stranger come to set their city on fire.

我相信光之王
I have faith in the Lord of Light.

相信我们的事业
I have faith in our cause.

相信司令大人你
And I have faith in my captain.

害怕吗 我的狮子? 
Are you afraid, my lion?

如果君临城破 史坦尼斯会烧死城内每一个兰尼斯特
If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find.

我当然害怕
Of course I'm afraid.

我不会让他们伤害你的
I won't let them hurt you.

没法选择自己的命运
I don't have a choice in all this.

但这场战争与你无关
But it's not your war.

不是万事都能靠你的身子解决的
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

还记得初次见面时 你在帐篷里对我说的话吗? 
Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent?

你要我拿出世界末日的劲头 跟你做爱
That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.

如你所知 陛下 学士对他所效力的家族的责任 不止是执行主人的命令 更要在战争时期 为主人提供必要的指导和建议
As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a Maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.

你的谏言一直都明智而慎重
Your words are always wise and measured.

如果你可以… 如果有什么不同的话 那就是学士的责任 在战争和骚乱中变得更加重要
If you could... If anything, a Maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil.

我记得在先王…
I remember back in the days of king...

你给我带了东西来? 
You brought me something?

夜影之水 极其有效也非常危险
Essence of Nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

在红酒中加入一滴 就能缓和紧绷的神经
A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

三滴会带来 无梦的深眠 十滴的话…
Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep.  ten drops, however...

我知道十滴的后果
I know what 10 drops will bring.

陛下 可否容我冒昧地问… 不可
Your Grace, if I may ask... You may not.

你一定有很多事要忙
You must have a lot of work to do.

众多勇士很快就会需要你的谏言了
I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.

是的 围城往往…
Yes. A siege is very...

注意楼梯台阶 大学士 对你来说太多了
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.

陛下 ?  噢 他这样说  ?  ?  卡斯特梅的爵爷他这样说  ?  ?  然而今天 每逢雨季  ?  ?  雨水在大厅哭泣  ?  ?  内里却无人影  ?  ?  然而今天 每逢雨季  ?  ?  雨水在大厅哭泣  ?  ?  内里却无魂灵  ?
Your Grace.  and so he spoke that Lord of Castamere but now the rains weep o'er his halls with no one there to hear yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls and not a soul to hear.

敬大伙! 兰尼斯特万岁!
To the boys! Lannisters!

你从哪学到这首兰尼斯特的歌? 
Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

你的嗓子真不赖
You've got a pretty voice.

我也喜欢你的鼻子
And I like your nose.

你的鼻子被打破过多少次? 
How many times you break it?

第一次我才五岁
First time I was five.

我老妈用拨火棍给了我一下子
Me mom smacked me with an iron poker.

哦 她其实不是想打我
Oh, it wasn't me she was aiming at.

是想打我弟弟
She was trying for me little brother.

他可是个真正的讨厌鬼
Now he was a real pest.

第二次我九岁
Second time I was nine.

跟几个大孩子打了起来
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

嘿 你不会想知道第三次发生了什么的
Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.

不用可怜它
Don't feel sorry for him.

不等今晚过完它就会爬上你的屁股
He'll be halfway up your ass before the night's through.

我想他大概不喜欢我
I don't think he likes me.

你觉得自己是条硬汉? 
You think you're a hard man?

又有漂亮女人 还有不错的麦芽酒
We've got beautiful women and good brown ale.

你却只想着 把我们中的某个人送往冰冷地底下 那边甚至没有女人陪伴
And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.

哦 那边有女人
Oh, there's women in the ground.

我亲手便送过去不少
I put some there myself.

你喜欢干女人 喝酒 唱歌
You like fucking and drinking and singing.

但是杀人 杀人才是你的最爱
But killing killing's the thing you love.

你的主子小恶魔会想念你的
Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you.

我想他有一天会的
I expect he will someday.

开战之前再来一杯? 
One more drink before the war?

我一直很讨厌钟声
I've always hated the bells.

响起来就没好事 国王逝世 城市被围困
They ring for horror a dead king, a city under siege.

'是吗? ' 装得真像
'Is that it?' Nice touch.

好像你不知道城里每个男孩的名字似的
As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.

我不明白您在暗示什么
I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

我很肯定你明白我在暗示什么
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.

您要的地图
The map you asked for.

城市地下看来有二十里长的隧道
There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.

坦格利安家建城时不仅考虑了城防工事 还预留了必要的逃跑路线
The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.

听起来有点奇怪 但我是这艘船的船长
Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship.

船在人在 船亡人亡
And if the ship goes down, I go with her.

的确是豪言壮语
That is good to hear.

不过当船尚未沉没时 很多船长都夸下过这样的海口
Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat.

您看上去作好了打架的准备 大人
You look well suited for battle, My Lord.

为了我们彼此 我希望您是错的
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

小小鸟告诉我 史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩 和一位亚夏红袍女祭司鬼混在一起
My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a Red Priestess from Asshai.

您不相信古老的力量 大人? 
You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord?

血魔法 诅咒 易形者 你相信否? 
Blood spells, curses, shapeshiftingwhat do you think?

我猜您笃信眼见为实 也相信您信任的人看见的事
I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen.

您大概不会完全信任我
You probably don't entirely trust me.

嗯 别把它当成私人恩怨
Mm, don't take it personally.

其实我连我自己都不敢完全相信
I don't entirely trust myself.

但我确实看过一些事情 听过一些事情 那些您不曾见闻 我也宁愿自己未曾见闻的事情
And yet I have seen things and heard things things you have not, things I wish I had not.

我好像没告诉过您我是怎么被阉割的
I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.

是的 你应该没说过
No, I don't believe you have.

黑暗的魔法为史坦尼斯大人带来了军队 为他铺好抵达君临城门的道路
The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door.

侍奉此等力量的人倘若坐上铁王座
For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne,

没有比这更可怕的事了
I can think of nothing worse.

我相信您是唯一能阻止他的人
I believe you are the only man who can stop him.

他们在欢迎新王
They're welcoming the new king.

我从未听说鸣钟意味投降
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

他们想奏音乐? 那就合奏个痛快
They want to play music with us? Let's play.

记住 等船
Remember, wait till the shit

史坦尼斯的船已经进了海湾
The ships are in the bay.

放他们深入 别让他们
They must be far enough in so they won't be

我懂什么是'深入'
I know what 'in' means.

知道怎么使这家伙吗?  我砍过树
Do you know how to use that? I chopped wood once.

不 我是见过我老哥砍树
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

我见过你用盾牌杀人
I saw you kill a man with a shield.

拿斧子的你勇不可挡
You'll be unstoppable with an axe.

别被杀了, 你也一样 朋友
Don't get killed. Nor you, my friend.

噢 我们现在是朋友了?  当然是
Oh, are we friends now? Of course we are.

我付钱你效劳 并不会消减我们的友谊
Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.

噢 佣兵嘴里居然吐出'升华'这种高雅词
Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword.

和高雅的爷们儿混久了呗
Been spending time with fancy folks.

珊莎小姐 和 嗯 雪拉
Lady Sansa and, uh, Sheila.

想必我姐姐邀请你跟其他贵妇人 一起去梅葛楼了吧? 
Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

是的 大人 但乔佛里国王召我来为他送行
She has, My Lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

我外甥还真浪漫啊
He's been a great romantic, my nephew.

我会祈祷您平安归来的 大人
I will pray for your safe return, My Lord.

就像我为国王祈祷的一样
Just as I pray for the King's.

你的国王即将出征
Your king rides forth to battle.

你要吻别他
You should see him off with a kiss.

我命名它为'噬心'
Hearteater I've named it.

等我回来 你要再吻它 到时你会尝到我叔叔的鲜血
You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my Uncle's blood.

您会亲自杀掉他么
Will you slay him yourself?

只要史坦尼斯蠢到向我挑战
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

那您会率领前锋 冲出城门喽? 
So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the Vanguard?

国王可不会跟愚蠢的姑娘家 讨论战术
A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.

抱歉 陛下 您说得对 我很愚蠢
I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.

您当然会率领前锋
Of course you'll be in the Vanguard.

听说我哥哥罗柏 总往战况最激烈的地方去
They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest.

而他还不是真正的国王呢
And he is only a pretender.

有一天会轮到你哥哥的

国王之手让我告诉你 再让你转告国王
The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the King

要是我让猎狗把你砍成两半 他想都不用想 直接就会动手
If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.

祈祷诸神赐予大家慈悲
For the Gods to have mercy on us all.

是的 陛下, 连我在内? 
Yes, Your Grace. Even me?

当然 陛下

乔佛里是我的, 噢 闭嘴吧 你这个小傻瓜
Joffrey is myOh, shut up, you little fool.

祈祷诸神赐予大家慈悲
Praying to the Gods to have mercy on us all.

诸神没有慈悲 所以他们才是神
The Gods have no mercy. That's why they're Gods.

我父亲在我祈祷的时候曾这么教诲我
My father told me that when he caught me praying.

你瞧 那时我母亲刚去世
My mother just died, you see.

我还不懂得什么是死亡 什么是终结
I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it.

我以为只要非常非常虔诚地祈祷 诸神就会把母亲还给我 毕竟我才四岁
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the Gods would return my mother to me. I was four.

您父亲不信仰诸神吗? 
Your father doesn't believe in the Gods?

他信仰诸神 只是不大喜欢他们
He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.

不对不对 是喝 小丫头

我当然要这样 将来如果你成为乔佛里的王后 你也得这么做
It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

若我那可恶的弟弟侥幸成功 这些母鸡就会回到她们的公鸡身边 宣传我是如何勇敢地激励她们 振作她们的精神
If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.

要是城堡陷落呢? 
And if the city should fall?

你就希望那样 对不对? 
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

红堡或许还能坚守一时 令我有时间登上城墙 亲自向史坦尼斯公爵请降
The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

城外若是换做别人
If it were anyone else outside those gates,

我还能试试去哄他
I might have hoped for a private audience.

但这是史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
But this is Stannis Baratheon.

我还不如去哄他的马
I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.

就像是一块 送上门的甜美蛋糕
A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.

划啊! 划啊! 就这样 弟兄们!

甚至连我们的父亲也常分不清

我永远无法理解为何彼此会受到迥异的对待
I could never understand why they treated us differently.

詹姆练习长剑 枪矛和钉头锤 我却练习微笑 唱歌和讨人欢喜
Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please.

他成了凯岩城的继承人 我则像马一样被卖给陌生人 新主人想骑就骑
He was heir to Casterly Rock and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.

您是劳勃的王后
You were Robert's queen.

And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

我想我不认识这个人
I don't think I know this one.

那你们这些'完人'比我多出了什么? 
But what does that make the lot of you?

城门是唯一的出路
The only way out is through the gates.

And they're at the gates.

还有一条路 我带你们走

从背后偷袭 狠操他们的屁眼

他非常害怕

于是狮子妈妈说:'好孩子 你是狮子

Would you like something for the pain?

叛国逆贼史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩 被令尊大人亲自率兵打了个落花流水
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.

这是您的新房间
These are your new chambers.

可能有点窄 但你本来也不占多大地儿 对吧? 
A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you?

你已经不是首相了
You are no longer Hand of the King.

我 安达尔人和先民的合法国王 七国统治者 暨全境守护
I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

拜拉席恩家族的 乔佛里一世 在此宣布 我的外祖父

玛格丽・提利尔
'百花骑士'之妹

培提尔・贝里席 并任其为国王之手
财政大臣 '小指头' and the Hand of the King.

谢谢您  陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

培提尔・贝里席大人 请上前来
Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.

兰尼斯特与提利尔两大家族的联合 多亏你的尽职尽责和足智多谋
For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,

是以 我宣布将赫伦堡及其所有封地和赋税恩赐给你
I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal...

你的子孙后代 将世代继承此等荣耀 万世不辍
With all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.

陛下 舍妹玛格丽 她的丈夫不久之前死于非命
Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before...

I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our Houses.

玛格丽小姐 您可愿如此? 
Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

乐意之至 陛下

我远道来此 只为向您倾吐爱慕之情
I have come to love you from afar.

关于您英明和勇武的传说 片刻未离我耳畔
Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears.

早已深入我心

同样 关于你容貌和风姿的传说我也早有耳闻 只不过那些传说 还不足以描绘出您的美丽优雅
Well, I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, My Lady.

如能回报你的厚爱 实属我的荣幸 无奈我已有婚约在身
It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another.

国王必须信守承诺
A King must keep his word.

陛下 您的御前会议认为 迎娶已经明正典刑的叛徒之女 既为不智 亦为不妥 更何况此时她的哥哥正高举叛旗 公然反抗铁王座
Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak.

为了王国的荣耀 御前会议恳请您 解除跟珊莎・史塔克的婚约
For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.

Margaery! We want Margaery!

我愿意参考你们的意见 听取人民的愿望 但我的婚约立于诸神之前
I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.

陛下 诸神见证的婚约的确神圣庄严 但您的父亲 受神荣宠的先王 订此婚约之时 史塔克家叛迹未显
Your Grace, the Gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness.

我就此事咨询过总主教 他十分笃定 由于史塔克的叛国罪行 您对他们的任何誓约义务均已失效 诸神可鉴
I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the Gods.

令我得遂心愿
I am free to heed my heart.

洛拉斯爵士 迎娶令妹将是无上之喜
Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.

你将成为我的王后 从今日起 我将始终爱你 至死不渝
You will be my Queen and I will love you from this day until my last day.

我深表同情

他们说的对 我配不上他
They're right I'm not good enough for him.

你不该妄自菲薄
You shouldn't say that.

你的优秀无可指摘
You'll be good enough for many things.

可他仍然以随心所欲毒打你为乐趣
He'll still enjoy beating you.

何况既然你已经成了真正的女人 他还能用其他方式享用你
And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.

但既然他决定不娶我了
But if he's not marrying me

你以为他就会放你回家? 
He'll let you go home?

乔佛里可不会轻易放走手上的玩具
Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.

你有一颗温柔的心 和你母亲当年一样
You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age.

我能在你身上看到她的影子
I can see so much of her in you.

她就像我的亲姐姐
She was like a sister to me.

我会帮你 让你回家
I'll help get you home.

现在 君临就是我的家
King's Landing is my home now.

这里每个人都是骗子
We're all liars here.

而且每一个都比你高明
And every one of us is better than you.

请随意
Make yourself comfortable.

这看上去也太拘束了
That doesn't look very comfortable.

亲爱的 不用这样
No need for that, my dear.

男人都喜欢看这些
Most men like what they see.

我和别的男人不一样
I'm not like most men.

别的男人也都这么说
That's what most men say.

如果你和别的男人想要的不一样 那请告诉我 你希望让我做什么呢
If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.

我希望你能告诉我 为贝里席大人工作 是否就是你想要的一切
I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.

如果见过 你会不记得吗? 
You wouldn't remember me if we had?

我想你记得他们每个人
And I think you remember all of them.

我想这是对你真正天赋的浪费
I think your true talents are wasted on them.

大人 您太好心了
You're very kind, My Lord.

请允许我报答您吧
Allow me to return the favor.

怎么? 我下面又没什么危险的玩意儿
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

而且和你的现任雇主不同
And, unlike your current employer,

我会为我的手下提供保护
I protect those who work for me.

也不为了满足贵族老爷的某些怪癖 虐待他们 或强迫他们互相虐待
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.

你怎么知道这些事的? 
How do you know about that?

你不是说知道我是谁吗
I thought you said you knew who I was.

有什么可以效劳的 瓦里斯大人? 
What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

小指头看你的时候 看到的是一个长着洞的赚钱机器
Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes.

而我却看到的却是一个潜在的合作伙伴
I see a potential partner.

我怕他  哦 这很正常
I'm afraid of him. Oh, you should be.

他可是个危险的家伙
He's a dangerous man.

不过每个人都有各自的弱点
But everyone has their weaknesses.

你的老板自认为隐藏得很好 但实际上稍微差了点
Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.

你还是个处女 猜的对吗? 
You're a virgin, I take it?

你的童年一定很悲惨
Childhood must have been awful for you.

你是不是比其他男孩都高一头? 
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?

他们嘲笑你 给你起外号? 
They laughed at you, called you names?

有些男孩喜欢挑战自己
Some boys like a challenge.

肯定有那么一两个试图强上大块头布蕾妮
One or two must have tried to get inside big Brienne.

有那么一两个  啊
One or two tried. Ah.

可是你把他们都打跑了
But you fought them off.

不过没准你希望他们中的某个能打败你 把你推倒在地 撕掉你的衣服
But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes.

可惜他们都不够强壮
But none of them were strong enough.

我倒是挺强壮  我对你没兴趣
I'm strong enough. Not interested.

你一定想知道做女人是什么滋味
You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.

啊 '贱人与狮子同床'
Ah. 'They lay with lions.'

依我看是旅店小妹
Tavern girls, I'd say.

八成侍奉的是我老爸的士兵
Probably served my father's soldiers.

也许有一位给了他们一个吻 一段情
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.

然后就落得如此下场
That's how they earned this.

为自由而战的北方战士的杰作啊
The glorious work of the northern freedom fighters.

你效忠这样的史塔克家族 一定倍感荣耀
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

我不效忠史塔克家族 我只效忠凯特琳夫人
I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

晚上梦见她们的时候记得用这话安慰自己
Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.

你要干嘛?   埋葬她们
What are you doing? Burying them.

我们不宜在此久留 得赶紧回到河上去
We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.

我觉得这些女人能够理解
I think these women would understand if

我才不在乎你怎么觉得
I don't care what you think.

我没把匕首落在这
I didn't leave it here.

我给了你去砍断绳索 然后就找不到了
I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have my dagger no more.

所以说你肯定把匕首弄丢了 除非你用它自慰的时候卡在屁股里了 喂!
So unless it got stuck in your ass on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone whoa!

你们在这里做什么? 
What's your business here?

押送囚犯
Traveling a prisoner.

你是个娘儿们 一个娘儿们!
You're a woman. A woman!

如果你们笑够了
If you've quite finished up

行 行 我们这就走
All right, we'll be going.

你是哪边的
Who do you fight for?

鬼知道呢 这年头显然连吃东西都是犯罪了
Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?

不 偷东西才是犯罪
No, stealing is a crime.

挨饿就不算 这就是你的公正
But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.

你要把他带到哪里去?   奔流城
Where are you taking him? To Riverrun.

偷了徒利家的东西 自然要在他们的地牢里度余生
Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.

干嘛不杀了他?   就因为偷了一头猪? 
Why not kill him? For stealing a pig?

我只是奉命行事
I don't give the orders.

他一定对某人很重要
He must be important to someone.

让你押送他? 这能有多重要? 
Sending him with you? How important could he be?

好吧 你走你的 小姐
All right, have it your way, m'lady.

我认识你吗?   你到过烙印城? 
Do I know you? Have you been to Ashemark?

没有  那你不认识我
No. Then you don't know me.

你有没有去过盐石城的河边集市? 
Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?

离烙印城很近吗?   不
Is it near Ashemark? No.

我没去过那里
I've never been there.

你们对这些美女作何评价? 
What do you think of these beauties?

我希望你当初给她们一个干脆
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

是啊 有两个死得蛮干脆
Two of them we did, yeah.

他是詹姆・兰尼斯特
That's Jaime Lannister.

这事怎么没人告诉我
I wish someone had told me.

早知就不用去偷那头该死的猪了
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

如果真是弑君者 我肯定知道
If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.

你怎么知道弑君者长什么样? 
How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?

我参加了呓语森林之战 我见过他
I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.

他们从树林中把他拖出来 扔到国王面前
They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the King.

他不是弑君者 抱歉让你失望了
He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you.

他要真是 我只带着他的脑袋就够了
If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

我有一个问题问你们俩
I have a question for you both.

我要你们同时回答
And I want you to answer it at the same time.

我数到三 你们一同开口
I count to three, you both answer.

他们可是史塔克的人
Those were Stark men.

我说了我不效忠史塔克家族
I don't serve the Starks.

我只效忠凯特琳夫人
I serve Lady Catelyn.

我向她保证过把你带到君临 我说到做到
I told her I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do.

瓦德・佛雷可不能随便得罪
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

那你还要这么干?

我知道你觉得这很重要
I know that seems important to you.

这就是对我很重要
It is important to me.

我嫁给你父亲的时候他并不爱我
Your father didn't love me when we married.

我们几乎不认识彼此
He hardly knew me or I him.

爱情不是从天而降的
Love didn't just happen to us.

那是我们这么多年来 从一点一滴中收获的 有你一点 有你的兄弟姐妹们一点 有我们每个人一点
We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us.

它虽然不像在树林里偷欢那么刺激 但却更加坚定
It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger.

这就是我与瓦德・佛雷的某个女儿之间 将要发生的故事吗 就像你和父亲一样?   有什么不好呢? 
And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had? Why not?

就因为她不漂亮? 
Because she's not beautiful?

因为她没有异域风情 让你没有激情? 
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

你现在一定要跟我争个明白 还不是因为这婚事是你一手安排的
Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.

你当时也同意了
And you agreed to it.

你向他发过誓
You gave him your word.

对自己的誓言不负责任 你的手下也会有样学样
Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same.

你父亲一辈子活着只为了一件事
If your father lived his life for one thing

而我的母亲没有资格 指责任何人不负责任
And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.

你说你在火焰中看到了我的胜利
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

现在也一样  火焰撒谎了
I still see it. The flames lied.

我现在就跟那些白痴野蛮人一样 盲目地相信一个火神
And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a Fire God.

我在黑水湾上为你的神明而战
I fought for your God in Blackwater Bay.

我带领部下来到七层地狱门外 手下的兄弟们被活活烧死 图个什么? 
I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what?

被泰温・兰尼斯特和提利尔们从后方包抄
Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

如果这些你在火焰中都看到了 为什么不警告我? 
If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?

光之王只给了我惊鸿一瞥
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

你说你是神的代言人
You claimed to speak for a God.

你会因为输掉一场战役而放弃整个战争吗? 
Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?

说得好像你对战争有多么了解一样
You talk about war as if you understand it.

论打仗我可比你经历得多多了
I've been fighting far longer than you.

是吗? 让我瞧瞧你怎么打的
Have you? Show me how you fight.

你的神明现在在哪里? 
Where's your God now?

我谋杀了我的弟弟

And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire.

你就是光明的战士
You are the Warrior of Light.

你会把这些伪王一个接一个地扫除
You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.

你夸夸其谈 但是 你自己也不清楚
You promise these things, but you don't know.

凝视火焰 我的陛下
Look into the fire, my King.

我会宰了他
I will kill that man.

我不管会被多少箭矢射中 会被多少长矛刺穿
I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me,

但我倒下前一定手刃那个吹号角的王八蛋
I will kill that hornblowing cunt before I fall.

他们想让你知道你被包围了
They want you to know you're surrounded.

我知道被包围了
I know I'm surrounded.

我知道 因为我到城垛上去看过了 我看到我被包围了
I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.

他们不想让你睡觉
They don't want you to sleep.

他们想先耗光你的精力 然后
They want to sap your spirit before

谢谢了 知无不言的老秃子
Thank you, wise bald man.

谢谢你教导我什么是围城

我父亲没来信? 
No word from my father?

您已经杀了所有乌鸦
You killed all the ravens.

我第一次看见临冬城
The first time I saw Winterfell

我第一次看见临冬城 就觉得它像是早已在此 矗立千年 而且在我死后 它仍将在此矗立千年
The first time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead.

我看着它想
I saw it and I thought,

'难怪奈德・史塔克能够镇压我们的反抗 干掉我的哥哥们
'of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers.

他临冬城这样的地方生长 我们面对他毫无胜算'
We never stood a chance against a man who lives here.'

史塔克大人想尽办法让它成为你的家
Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.

是啊 他抓了我然后对我很好

如果你还算识趣 或许会撑过今晚 活到明天
If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night.

如果你装哑巴的话 可就离死不远了
Not talking's not the way to go.

可别砍到自己
You might cut yourself.

你从没用过剑 是吧? 
Never swung a sword before, have you?

看着就像个玩拨浪鼓的毛孩子
You look like a baby with a rattle.

好让你邀请曼斯・雷德去黑城堡做客? 
So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?

就这样? 你就这点能耐? 
That's it? That's what you can do?

这是你那叛徒老爹教你的么? 
Your traitor father teach you that?

还是你那婊子老娘遗传的? 
Or was it your whore mother?

我们是长城上的卫士
We are the Watchers on the Wall.

你可以去跟曼斯说 这位是杀掉断掌科林的人
You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.

你可不会希望这位变成尸鬼回来找你的
You don't want this one coming back for you.

跟我来 琼恩・雪诺
Come along, Jon Snow.

是时候让你见见塞外之王了
Time to meet the KingBeyondTheWall.

他说你绝不可能活着离开魁尔斯
He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.

谢谢你 札罗・赞旺・达梭斯
Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

多谢你教给我这宝贵的一课
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

我可以帮助你了 真心实意地帮你
I can help you now, truly help you.

我们可以一起夺回铁王座
We can take the Iron Throne.

我会给你一千艘船  我求您了 卡丽熙
I'll bring you 1,000 ships. Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

您的梦想成真指日可待!
All that you have dreamed is within your reach!

卡丽熙  求您了 求您了
Khaleesi. Please! Please!

对我来说足够货真价实
Looks real enough to me.

够买一条船么? 
Real enough to buy a ship?

我还以为我们北上是来打野人的呢
I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.

人类绝不应该住在 任何需要靠烧大便取暖的地方
People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.

好吧 你要是看到了树 记得告诉我一声
Well, you see a tree, let me know.

其实你要是退一步去想想这些事 我是说 有关吉莉的那些事 真的还是挺耐人寻味的
If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is

你他妈还是杀了我吧  不 我是说真的
Just bloody kill me. No, truly.

我觉得吉莉这人还挺耐人寻味的 即使被卡斯特那样对待 她仍然怀有希望 觉得生活会变得更好
The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.

你觉得吉莉这人挺耐人寻味 无非是因为 她跟你蹦了几个单词儿
The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.

我觉得你这人也挺耐人寻味的 因为寻不着味
And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.

一定是琼恩和断掌
It's Jon and the Halfhand.

两声号响 是野人 野人来犯
Two blasts is wildlings.

渡鸦送出去了么? 
Did you send the ravens?

渡鸦送出去了么? 
Did you send the ravens?

我们得回长城去
We need to get back to the Wall.

我们知道将要面对什么 但是我们必须赶回 必须发出警报 否则 在凛冬结束之前 所有你认识的人 都会死
We know what's out there, but we have to make it,have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead.

你是第一次见到巨人吧 琼恩・雪诺? 
First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?

不过可别盯太久 他们害羞得很
Well, don't stare too long.They're shy.

等害羞的劲儿过去了 他们可要生气了
When they stop being shy,they get angry.

等他们开始生气了
And when they're angry,

就会像砸钉子一样把人砸到地上 这可是我可亲眼见过的
I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.

看那边! 乌鸦!
Look over there! Crow!

乌鸦! 看呐! 快看!
Crow! Look over here!Look!

啊 看呐 乌鸦过来了!
Ah, look, crow coming!

你穿错衣服了
You're wearing the wrong color.

你们乌鸦从心底渴望自由飞翔
In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.

如果我成了自由人 是否有离开的自由? 
When I'm free,will I be free to go?

但我也有猎杀你的自由
And I'll be free to kill you.

这帮小子无法无天
Got no respect, this lot.

因为他们犯错的时候可没有父亲扇他们耳光
Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.

他们的父亲怎么了? 
What happened to their fathers?

有些死在你们这些乌鸦手上
Some of them were killed by crows like you.

脸色别这么难看啊 琼恩・雪诺
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

要是曼斯・雷德喜欢你 你自然可以多活一两天
If Mance Rayder likes you,you'll live another day.

托蒙德
野人掠袭者 '巨人克星'

斯迪
野人 瑟恩族的首领

我们杀了他的同伴
We killed his friends.

寻思着你可能想问这家伙点什么
Thought you'd want to question this one.

一只乌鸦宝宝能问出什么来? 
What do we want with a baby crow?

这只乌鸦宝宝杀了断掌科林
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.

他想加入我们
He wants to be one of us.

那断手的杂种杀了我的朋友
That half handed cunt killed friends of mine.

身形都有你两倍大
Friends twice your size.

我父亲说过 只要你一剑穿心 大个子和小个子一样 眨眼就死
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.

有不少小个子 想要拿剑穿了我的心
Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart.

如今他们的小骨头 都被埋在林子里了
And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods.

小子 你叫什么?  琼恩・雪诺
What's your name, boy? Jon Snow.

从今以后 我放屁的时候你们最好跪下来
From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.

长城之外 我们不向任何人下跪
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.

那么 你就是奈德・史塔克的私生子
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

谢谢你的礼物 骸骨之王
Thank you for the gift,Lord of Bones.

你喜欢她么 雪诺? 
You like her back, Snow?

你为了这个加入我们的? 
That why you want to join us?

天杀的守夜人让你戒掉女色 咱们这儿可没这套
This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.

刚才被你误认成我的那个在吃鸡的是'巨人克星'托蒙德
This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

我不相信 这小崽子能杀了断掌
Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.

曼斯・雷德 他死了我很高兴
野人首领 '塞外之王' and I'm glad he's dead.

他曾是我的兄弟
He was my brother once.

那时他的手还没断
Back when he had a whole hand.

你怎么跟着他的? 
What were you doing with him?

司令大人把我派到断掌手下锻炼
The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.

他想让我有朝一日可以带兵上阵
He wants me to lead one day.

但你却在这里 成了叛徒 跪在塞外之王的脚下
But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King beyond the Wall.

如果我是叛徒 那你也一样
If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.

为什么要加入我们 琼恩・雪诺? 
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?

不 恐怕不是
No, I don't think so.

我看你真正想要的 是逞英雄
I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.

我问你最后一次 为什么要加入我们? 
I'll ask you one last time why do you want to join us?

我们北上的时候停在卡斯特的堡垒
We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.

我看见卡斯特把他的亲生儿子 遗弃在森林里
I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.

你说你看见它们中的一个? 
You're telling me you saw one of them?

那么是什么让你舍弃了你的弟兄? 
And why would that make you desert your brothers?

当我告诉司令大人的时候 他早已经知道了
Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.

千万年以前 先民曾跟异鬼战斗 而且击败了他们
Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them.

我想加入愿为生者而战的阵营
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.

我来对了么? 
Did I come to the right place?

我们得给你找件新斗篷
We'll need to find you a new cloak.

把那条布摘了怎么样? 
What if you took off that bit there?

你就不打算留一点想象的空间? 
Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?

问题是 我实在缺乏想象力
Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.

那你来脱好了
I want you to take it off.

波隆爵士 波隆爵士
Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

抱歉 爵士 退出去
Apologies, ser. Back away.

叫你往后退 退到屋子外面
Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment.

然后再后退一点 提利昂大人派我来
Then back away some more. Lord Tyrion sent me.

我要剁了你 小子
I will murder you, boy.

他说这事关乎生死
He said it was a matter of life and death.

波德?  我是你姐姐
Pod? It's your sister.

他们来干嘛的? 
What are they doing here?

算是保护我 不让我进去么? 
Protecting me, I assume.Will you let me in?

不 你不能进来
No, I don't think so.

要是我想杀了你
If I wanted to kill you,do you think

你觉得这堵木头门能挡着我? 
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

我不怕你 小弟弟
I'm not afraid of you,little brother.

你来干嘛?  我来看看你的脸
Why are you here? I wanted to see your face.

听说你的鼻子没了 现在看来没那么恐怖
They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.

砍我鼻子的那个人没的可不止鼻子
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

那些叛徒想要乔佛里的脑袋 却丢了他们自己的
The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.

当然, 要杀我的可不是个叛徒
Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.

这国王之手的房间可真够寒酸的
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.

不过反正太大的房间你也用不着
But then I don't suppose you need much room.

大学士派席尔也这么取笑过我
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.

你肯定特别骄傲 能和蛋都垂到膝盖的老头一样招笑
You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.

你今天要跟父亲见面? 
You're meeting Father today?

你怎么知道
How do you know that?

我有很多密探
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.

情报总管刚好欠我几个人情
The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.

父亲跟我说了 你到底想要什么? 
Father told me. What do you want from him?

我要什么?  他可是我父亲
What do I want from him? He's my father.

我用得着要什么吗? 
Do I need to want something?

我相信他深爱我 就像任何一个父亲深爱他的 宝贝儿子
I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy.

但是自从来到君临 他一次都没来看过我
Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing.

我的脸被劈成两半 躺在床上奄奄一息 他都没来看过我
I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.

说的我都要哭了
You're going to make me cry.

你为什么想知道我对他的要求? 
Why do you care what I want from him?

因为你曾在父亲面前造谣
Because you've slandered me to Father before.

你跟他说我在凯岩城的时候 曾命令卫兵殴打侍女
You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

你确实让卫兵打了她
You did have your guards beat her.

一个只有九岁的小女孩
A girl of nine, I believe.

我没记错的话 她为此瞎了一只眼
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

我没记错的话 她以后再也不敢偷项链了
If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.

事是真的, 就不算造谣
It's not slander if it's true.

那你今天又想跟父亲说什么真话? 
And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?

为什么我要跟父亲说的话 会让你这么不安? 
Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?

因为你是个骗子
Because you're a liar.

你肯定会说我和乔佛里的坏话
I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

比如? 
Any lies in particular?

你是挺聪明 但是比你自己想的可差远了
You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.

那也比你聪明多了
Still makes me more clever than you.

看这俩金光闪闪的勇士哟
Oh, look at these two shining warriors.

特林・马兰爵士还有这个…
Ser Taryn Mant and...

谁他妈关心是什么骑士
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

在下是黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

你不是骑士 波德
You're no knight. Pod.

黑水河的波隆爵士 可是国王陛下亲自册封的
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.

你不过是个一夜暴富的恶棍罢了 仅此而已
You're an up jumped cutthroat, nothing more.

你说的没错
That's exactly who I am.

而你就是个穿着华丽盔甲的蛆 比起打仗 我看你更擅长殴打小女孩
And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.

现在嘛, 我跟提利昂大人约好了
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

你敢碰一下门 我就砍了你的手
You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.

我不仅享受阳光下的散步, 大人
As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship,

还很想知道你为什么要叫我来
I am wondering why you sent for me.

这城市里想杀我的人不计其数
A number of people in this city want to kill me.

你却在保护我
You're here to protect me.

这活我可干了挺久
I've been doing that for a while now.

这活没让你变得人见人烦么
Do you grow bored protecting me?

这活只让我变穷了
I grow poor protecting you.

你可是在我的照顾下才成为骑士的 你现在都是都城守备队的队长了
Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.

废话少说 你肯定没少中饱私囊
Briefly. I'm sure you filled your pockets.

现在我可是身无分文
And now my pockets are empty.

你是让我尝了点甜头
You've given me a taste for the finer things.

不过你要是还想继续被保护的话 就得出更高价才行
And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

我还以为咱俩是朋友呢 确实是
I thought we were friends. We are.

可我是个佣兵 我的武力是用来出售的
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.

可不是用来帮朋友的
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

双倍?  我现在可是骑士了
Double? I'm a knight now.

骑士可值双倍的价儿
Knights are worth double.

我连自己现在正付你多少都不知道
I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.

这正说明你完全付得起
Which means you can afford it.

我曾参与过黑水河之战
I was in the battle at Blackwater.

我是个船长, 也是个骑士
I was a captain and a knight.

爵士, 你效忠哪个国王? 
Aye, ser, and serving which king?

维斯特洛唯一的真王
The one true king of Westeros

我还以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

大家都是这么想的
Everyone thought you were dead.

他可能像你一样游上岸了
He may have swam ashore as you did.

没有, 我眼睁睁看着他死于野火
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

我很遗憾, 老友
I'm so sorry, my friend.

我也曾失去一个儿子
I, too, have lost a son.

这是世界上最糟糕的事儿
There is nothing worse in this world.

不过, 戴佛斯, 你是个好父亲
But, Davos, you were a good father.

如果我真的是好父亲, 他就不会死
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

他在龙石岛舔伤口呢
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

你会带我过去吗? 
Will you take me there?

龙石岛对我来说啥都不剩了
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

战争还没结束
This war is not over.

但是对于萨拉多・桑恩 战争到此为止了
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

我们都曾宣誓效忠于史坦尼斯陛下
We're both sworn to King Stannis.

我不效忠于任何人
I am sworn to no man.

我承诺提供 30 艘船, 你们则承诺给我荣华富贵
I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.

我给了船
I delivered the ships.

史坦尼斯从不放弃 从不
Stannis never gives up. Never.

他将从新组织…  他已经输了
Now he will regroup He's a broken man.

他的舰队在黑水湾全军覆没
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

据说他谁都不见… 他的将士 甚至他的妻子
They say he sees no one not his generals, not even his wife.

只剩下那个红袍女 在他耳边瞎嘀咕 鬼扯些火焰中的影像 要不就是火烧大活人
Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.

史坦尼斯归来后点了场大火
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.

所有反对她的人都被称为 暗黑仆人
All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness.

传说她边吟唱边烧那些人
They say she sang to them as they burned.

暗黑仆人
Servants of darkness.

我倒觉得龙石岛才是我们得避开的地方
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.

带我回去, 求你
Take me back there, please.

你又不能让史坦尼斯反对她
You cannot turn Stannis against her.

也许不能, 但是我可以杀了她
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

要是失败了, 他们会烧了你
If you fail, they will burn you.

要是成功了, 他们还是会烧了你
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

而你才刚捡了条命
And you've only just come back to life.

再活久点儿吧, 老友
Stay alive a little longer, my friend.

你叫我老友, 你我在我婚礼上喝得大醉一场
You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.

你还跟我在我的 4 次婚礼上大醉 4 场呐 可我从没求你帮过忙
And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.

求你了, 帮我这个忙
Please, do this for me.

我就把你的骨头装在个小袋子里 好让你那可怜的寡妇挂在脖子上
I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.

我们得在距离赫伦堡 1000 米的地方设下包围圈
We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

不用包围 魔山守不了一片废墟
There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

我想只要泰温・兰尼斯特下令 不管是哪魔山都会抵抗到底
I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.

自从牛津之战后 兰尼斯特就一直在和我们捉迷藏
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.

我想战斗 男人都想要场光明正大的战斗
I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.

恐怕咱们是得不到了
I don't think we're going to get one.

200 个北方人被人像羊一样屠宰
200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.

这命债我们一定要讨回来, 朋友
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

为了他们, 也为了你的儿子
For them and for your sons.

他们在泥巴里腐烂 凶手却逃之夭夭
They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.

弑君者不会自由很久的
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.

我已经派出最好的人去追他了
My best hunters are after him.

一个梅利斯特?  杰米爵士
A Mallister? Ser Jeremy.

我父亲的人
My father's bannerman.

找间屋子把她关起来
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.

她放跑了詹姆・兰尼斯特
She freed Jaime Lannister.

兰尼斯特夺走了他们的儿子 而她, 则夺走了他们的正义
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.

这伤口需要清洗缝合
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

你叫什么, 朋友? 
What's your name, friend?

你能活下来真幸运
You're lucky to be alive.

你带着这徽章挺合适
The badge looks good on you.

差点就比我带着还合适了
Almost as good as it looked on me.

这新职位让你挺享受的? 
Are you enjoying your new position?

我当国王之手的时候可开心了
I was very happyas Hand of the King.

我听说了
I heard how happy you were.

你把妓女都带到我床上去了
You brought a whore into my bed.

那会儿还不是你的床呢
It wasn't your bed at the time.

我把你送来是辅佐国王的
I sent you here to advise the king.

我给了你真正的权力和职位
I gave you real power and authority.

而你却选择 同以往一样 和妓女鬼混 和小偷共饮
You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.

有时我也和妓女共饮
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

提利昂 你到底想要什么? 
What do you want, Tyrion?

为什么人人都以为我意有所图
Why does everyone assume I want something?

我就不能只是想来看看亲爱的老爸吗? 
Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?

我这个亲爱的老爸 在儿子英勇负伤之后 不知怎么的忘记来看儿子了
My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.

派席尔大学士保证你的伤势不致命
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.

当你在赫伦堡的废墟上忙着开会时 是我组建了这座城市的防御
I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.

敌人军临城下时 是我领军迎战 而你的外孙 国王陛下 却躲在城墙后面发抖
I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.

我为了家族血染沙场
I bled in the mud for our family.

却是被丢进个小黑牢里
I was trundled off to some dark little cell.

一点该死的感激会是一个不错的开始
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

戏子和歌手才需要喝彩
Jugglers and singers require applause.

每次我在战场上负伤 你以为只要塞我个玫瑰花环就行了吗
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?

如今 我有七国要料理 其中三地正公然叛乱
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion.

直说你到底想怎么样吧
So tell me what you want.

我想要我应得的
I want what is mine by right.

詹姆是你的大儿子理应继承你的领土和头衔
Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.

但他是御林铁卫不能娶妻也没有继承人
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

詹姆从披上白袍那天起 就自动放弃了对凯岩城的继承权
The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

而我是你的儿子 是你法定的继承人
I am your son and lawful heir.

你想要凯岩城? 
You want Casterly Rock?

我们会给你找个和你的名头 更相称的封地 当作是在黑水湾一战中 对你战功的褒奖吧
We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay.

时机成熟之后 再给你安排个 既合适你发挥才智 又维护我们声誉的职务 维护我们的名望
And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy.

你要是干得好 还能得到一名适合你的妻子
And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

我宁愿被蛆虫吃光 也不会玷污家族名誉 把凯岩城交给你
And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

你 你这个害死母亲而出世的人? 
You, who killed your mother to come into the world?

你这个怪胎 畸形 不听话的主 心中装满妒忌 淫欲缠身 尽耍小聪明
You are an ill made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

世人的律法让你冠我的姓氏 穿我的衣服 因为我无法证明你不是我的种
Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

诸神为了教导我谦逊之道 迫使我 目睹你佩着雄狮纹章 四处蹒跚招摇 那可是我父亲的纹章 我祖父的纹章!
And to teach me humility,the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.

但无论诸神还是世人 都不能强迫我把凯岩城交给你 让它变成你的妓院
But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.

再也休提凯岩城的继承权
Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.

下次教我在你床上发现妓女 我就吊死她
The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.

多恩 它往多恩去
Dorne.It's going to Dorne.

为什么要去多恩? 它载着丝绸而去 它本该载着酒酿而归
Why Dorne? It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.

可是它将一去不返
But it's not coming back.

船长已在冒险中疲惫 就让君临的老爷和夫人们 喝着更好的美酒直到不省人事
The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.

他会留在多恩
He's going to stay in Dorne.

那里没有冬天 美丽又温暖
Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.

我遇到过一些多恩来的人 他们可不这么美丽也不这么温暖
I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.

我早说了 我不想玩游戏
I told you, I don't want to play.

那个艘船又怎么样? 
What about that one there?

它要去瓦伦提斯
It's going to Volantis.

因为当我坐船去瓦伦提斯的时候 就是这样的船
Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.

游戏又不是这样玩的
That's not how the game works.

你不应该直接把答案说出来
You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.

要编一个故事 要描述这艘船到哪里去 为什么去
You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.

我既然已经知道了真相 为什么还要编故事呢
Why should I make up a story. when I know the truth?

因为真相 要么很可怕 要么很无聊
Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.

可以允许我和珊莎小姐聊聊
Might I speak with Lady Sansa

培提尔・贝里席 单独聊几句? 
财政大臣 '小指头' alone for a moment?

不久前 我见过你的母亲
I saw your mother not long ago.

她非常想见你
She's very eager to see you.

你说过你会带我回家
You said you'd take me home.

你说过君临就是你的家
You said King's Landing was your home.

你属于国王
You are the property of the crown.

带你走就是叛国之罪
Stealing you would be treason.

要是你走漏了嘴 哪怕只是一个人听到

He's an important person. So is she.

我长大在她父亲的城堡的阴影下

她出生那日 他们从日出一直到日落敲了一天
The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset.

我们混的都不错 你和我
We've both done rather well, you and I.

考虑到我们的出身

我希望你会想起你父亲

他只是个战士

骑士们发誓要做什么? 
And what do knights swear to do?

主持正义 保护弱小

你父亲做到了 你应该为他感到骄傲
Your father did that. Be proud of him.

你父亲也是战士吗? 
Was your father a soldier, too?

你也应该感到骄傲

在乔佛里国王的领导下 你们的父亲拯救了这座城市

我猜你肯定很冷

陛下 高庭的气候向来很温和

所幸我们提利尔的血液总是很热情
Luckily for us Tyrells,our blood runs quite warm.

是不是 洛拉斯?  没错
Doesn't it, Loras? Yes.

洛拉斯 王后的礼服华丽极了 不是吗? 
Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?

那织工 刺绣 还有那金属饰品
The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.

我从来没见过像这个一样的衣服
I've never seen anything like it.

当你做了王后 你会发现身着一点护甲总是有用的 说不定很快你就会体会到
You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen.Perhaps before.

乔佛里告诉我今天早上从圣堂返回的时候 你在跳蚤窝下轿了
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.

是的 我去了一家孤儿院 总主教大人向我提到过的
Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.

在高庭的时候玛格丽就为穷人们做过很多事
Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.

即便是最底层的百姓 只要敞开心扉接触他们 你会发现他们和贵族没有区别
The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.

敞开心扉? 在跳蚤窝如果你不小心的话 只会被'敞开心脏'
An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear.

不久前那里就曾有暴徒袭击我们
Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.

带着充足的护卫也没能阻止他们
We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.

国王都差点丧命
The king barely escaped with his life.

我母后向来喜欢夸大其辞
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.

随着她年龄渐长 越来越夸张了
Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.

暴徒根本没有威胁到我们的安全
Our lives were never truly in danger.

当然 你是对的
You're right, of course.

但你是你父亲的儿子
But you are your father's son.

其他人可没有国王的勇敢
We can't all have a king's bravery.

饥饿会把人变成野兽
Hunger turns men into beasts.

我很高兴提利尔家族能在这方面提供帮助
I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.

他们告诉我有 100 辆从河湾地而来的货车近日就会到达君临
They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.

小麦 大麦 还有苹果 七神保佑我们今年获得丰收
Wheat, barley, apples.We've had a blessed harvest.

当然在需要的时候 援助都城是我们的责任
And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.

既然如洛拉斯爵士所说
Well, as Ser Loras said,

玛格丽小姐以前就做过这种...  慈善活动
Lady Margaery has done this sort of...  charitable work before.

我想她应该知道自己在做什么
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

这些无垢者已经在这里站了整整一天一夜 不吃不喝
The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.

他们还将一动不动站到死亡来临
They will stand until they drop.

我们称之为'顺从'
Such is their obedience.

他们应该符合我的要求
They may suit my needs.

告诉我他们是怎么训练的
Tell me of their training.

他们五岁起接受训练
They begin their training at five.

每天从黎明一直练到天黑 直到熟练掌握短剑 盾牌和三种长矛
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears.

四个男孩里只有一个存活
Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.

他们绝对服从 绝对忠诚
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.

最勇敢的人也害怕死亡
Even the bravest men fear death.

我的主人说无垢者不是人
My master says the Unsullied are not men.

死亡对他们而言不算什么
Death means nothing to them.

他请您留心观察 陛下
He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.

告诉善主大人 不必如此
Tell the good master there is no need.

我的主人说男人不需要乳头
My master points out that men don't need nipples.

在赢得尖刺盔之前 无垢者必须拿一枚银币去奴隶市场 找到一个哭叫着的新生儿 并在其母眼前将其杀死
To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.

我的主人说 通过这样的方法 方能确定他心中未留有丝毫软弱之处
This way, my master says,we make certain there is no weakness left in them.

你们从母亲怀中抢走婴儿 在她注视之下将其杀死 然后支付一枚银币以补偿她的痛苦? 
You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

我的主人告诉您 钱乃是付给孩子的主人 不是给母亲
My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.

克拉兹尼主人请您速做决定
Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.

对无垢者感兴趣的买家很多
Many other buyers are interested.

无垢者是终结一切的工具
The Unsullied are a means to an end.

如果我买了他们 这些人
Once I own them, these men

他们不是人 不再是人了
They're not men. Not anymore.

如果我拥有一支奴隶军队 我成了什么? 
Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?

您想 这些奴隶属于您或者克拉兹尼和他那样的人 谁会给他们更好的生活呢? 
Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?

你对他们更加公正
You'll be fair to them.

你不会为了达到目的让他们残疾
You won't mutilate them to make a point.

也不会命令他们杀死新生儿
You won't order them to murder babies.

你会保证他们有吃有穿
You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.

他们已经经受了严重的不公正待遇
A great injustice has been done to them.

闭上双眼也不会有任何改变
Closing your eyes will not undo it.

我欠您一条命 先生
I owe you my life, ser.

我深感荣幸 女王陛下
The honor is mine, my queen.

我认识他 他是七国最强大的战士 以及劳勃・拜拉席恩的御前侍卫队长
I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.

我是巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
I am Barristan Selmy,

你父亲的御前侍卫
Kingsguard to your father.

请允许我加入你的御前侍卫 我不会再次辜负你
Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.

不要想太多 布兰
Don't think too much, Bran.

你们当中有谁在 10 岁时就是神射手的? 
And which one of you was a marksman at 10?

你不能杀死它
You can't kill it, you know.

因为那只乌鸦就是你
Because the raven is you.

毛毛狗
'毛毛'  瑞肯・史塔克的冰原狼

没事的 阿多
It's all right, Hodor.

你是不是又进入狼的体内了 小王子? 
Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?

不 是三眼乌鸦
No, it was the threeeyed raven.

我尝试杀死它 但我做不到
I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.

梦里有个男孩 我不想听这些
There was a boy. I don't want to hear about it.

但你开口问了 我们的烦恼够多了
But you asked. We've got plenty of worries.

不需要把黑暗魔法也加进来
We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.

我没想要做黑暗魔法的梦
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

我知道你不想 小王子
I know you didn't, little lord.

不知道谁可能在追着我们
We don't know who might be after us.

没有人知道我们还活着
No one even knows we're alive.

谁告诉你的? 
And who told you that?

三眼乌鸦告诉你的? 
The threeeyed raven tell you?

不是 那他还挺好
No. Some good he is, then.

我不知道别人知道什么不知道什么
I don't know what other people know and what they don't.

我只知道到长城还很远的路要走
I only know the Wall is a long way off.

我妈妈经常跟我讲 你们维斯特洛人是一帮无情的家伙
My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.

是冷血的 长胡子的 臭哄哄的 蛮子 你们会渡过狭海 趁我们睡觉时把我们偷偷绑走
Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.

你可曾想过你会嫁给一个这样的人? 
Did you ever think you'd marry one?

我从没想过我会嫁给任何一个人
I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

直到我遇见了 冷血的 长胡子的 臭哄哄的蛮子王
Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

抱歉 陛下
Pardon me, Your Grace.

吾后 波顿大人
My queen. Lord Bolton.

让我来猜猜哪个是好消息
Let me guess which one is the good news.

信件来自奔流城 和临冬城
Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.

我好多年没见过他了
I hadn't seen him in years.

都不知道到底有多少年
I don't even know how many.

我们一同前去参加葬礼
We'll travel to the funeral together.

在我们回来之前 波顿大人会据守在此地
Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.

在安葬我父亲的时候 我要带着手铐吗? 
Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?

当波顿家的私生子到达临冬城的时候 铁民已经离去
By the time Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.

他们残杀了所有人 将城堡付之一炬
They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.

布兰和瑞肯无处可寻
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.

没准他们逃脱了
They may have escaped.

没准席恩把他们带回铁群岛充当人质
Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.

你有收到什么要挟吗? 
Have you received any demands?

你到底有没有听到一点关于席恩的消息? 
Have you heard anything from Theon at all?

你知道徒步穿过田地和树林前往君临城
Do you know how long it's going to take us

詹姆・兰尼斯特 要花多少时间吗? 
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长 to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?

那我们怎么打发时间呢? 
So how shall we pass the time?

一步一个脚印地走
By putting one foot in front of the other.

那旅程会很无聊的
It's going to be a very dull walk.

我的任务是把你带到君临城 以换回史塔克夫人的女儿们
I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.

你知道 无论你如何忠诚 也没人愿意和你这种傻大个为伍
You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute.

打我出生起 就有人开始侍奉我
People have been serving me since I was born.

你觉得史塔克夫人会想要一个淡黄色头发的傻大个 伴随她终生? 
You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life?

过不了一个星期她就想命令你自裁了
A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.

如果史塔克夫人对我有任何不满
If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service,

我相信她会让我知道的
I'm sure she'll let me know.

她是一个诚实的女人
She's an honest woman.

这是她唯一的优点了
All the good it's done her.

你是怎么开始侍奉史塔克夫人的? 
How did you come into Lady Stark's service?

我们可以好好聊聊
There's something we can talk about.

不关你的事 弑君者
Not your concern, Kingslayer.

应该是最近的事
It had to be recently.

她在临冬城的时候你没跟着她
You weren't with her at Winterfell.

因为我去过临冬城
Because I visited Winterfell.

我难道看到过你那石头脑瓜 顶到拱门? 
I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.

你是否曾效忠史坦尼斯?  天哪 没有
Were you pledged to Stannis? Gods, no.

他不适合管理比一桌十二道菜的酒席 更重要的东西
He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12course meal.

闭上你的嘴 为啥? 
Shut your mouth. Why?

别忘了他从小就和我一起生活在宫廷里
I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget.

那小小郁金香身着绣花丝衣 在长廊中连跑带跳的场面
Could hardly escape the little tulip.

实在是无法忘怀
Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.

我对他的了解比你多得多
I knew him far better than you.

我对他的了解无人能及
I knew him as well as anyone.

作为他的御林铁卫 他对我无所不谈
As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything.

他会是一个好国王
He would have been a wonderful king.

听起来你很爱慕他
Sounds like you quite fancied him.

你有跟他说过吗? 
Did you ever tell him?

恐怕你不是蓝礼喜欢的类型
You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.

他更喜欢洛拉斯・提利尔这样的卷发小女孩
He preferred curlyhaired little girls like Loras Tyrell.

你阳刚之气太重了
You're far too much man for him.

我对这些下流的流言没兴趣
I'm not interested in foul rumors.

除非是关于我的
Unless they're about me.

这些关于蓝礼的话都是真的
It's all true about Renly.

他的性取向在宫中简直无人不晓
His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.

真可惜王座不是用阳具做的
It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.

估计人们是没法将他从上面拉下来的 闭上你的嘴
They'd have never got him off it. Shut your mouth!

我也没指责你
And I don't blame you, either.

爱上谁不是我们自己能做主的
We don't get to choose who we love.

你们是要去哪里?  南方
Where are you headed, then? South.

躲着国王大道是吧? 
Staying off the kingsroad, are you?

不管你到哪里他们都能找到你
They get you no matter where you go.

你们躲不掉 是啊 真的躲不掉
You can't win. No, you really can't.

不过看起来你倒挺安全
Looks like you're safe enough, though.

无意冒犯 女士 不过…
Meaning no offense, my lady, but...

我不想和你们纠缠
I wouldn't tangle with you.

七神保佑你们 也保佑你
Seven blessings to you. And you.

他不知道 也许你是对的
He doesn't. Maybe you're right.

但如果你错了呢 如果他告密咋办? 
But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?

他是无辜的
He's an innocent man.

比史塔克夫人的女儿们还无辜? 
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?

这里紧一些
Make it tighter here.

让你看起来更强壮
It makes you look very strong.

这些不好 拿其他的来
All these are wrong. Bring others.

看起来跟提利尔的玫瑰一样
Looks like a Tyrell rose.

送给玛格利装饰她的礼服好了
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.

应该够用了
Should be more than enough fabric.

告诉我你对她怎么看
Tell me what you think of her.

她是一个理想的伴侣
She's an ideal match.

有提利尔家族相助 我们会打败北方人
With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners.

杀死他们的领主 烧掉他们的要塞 给他们的庄稼撒盐 此后一个世纪都不会有人妄想造反了
Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.

这没错 不过你对她本人的看法呢? 
It is a good match, but what do you think of her?

她漂亮又聪明
She's beautiful and intelligent.

她体恤平民百姓 很有意思
Her concern with the wellbeing of the common people is interesting.

我是说这种与你不同的做法 会危及…
I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself

这是我遇到过的 最无聊的对话之一了
This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.

玛格利・提利尔给肮脏的孤儿们捐献是有原因的
Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.

她穿成荡妇的样子是有原因的
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.

她嫁给蓝礼・拜拉席恩这样的叛徒和众所周知的变态 也是有原因的
She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.

她嫁给蓝礼・拜拉席恩因为别人让她这么做
She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.

这才是聪明的女人… 照别人说的去做
That's what intelligent women do what they're told.

你需要好好问问自己…  我不需要做任何事
You need to ask yourselfI don't need to do anything.

我仍然难以相信
I still don't believe it.

他一无所求
He didn't. He didn't want anything.

他帮我只是因为他爱着我母亲
He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.

男人从一个漂亮女孩那里只想得到一样东西
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.

小指头不爱我
Littlefinger's not in love with me.

爱情不是他想要的
Love is not the thing he wants.

男人们才不在乎
They never see it that way.

他没有让你为他做什么? 
He didn't ask you to do something for him?

监视谁或者… ? 
Spy on someone or...?

不管他是要求你怎样 还是企图怎样 抑或碰你 我要你告诉我
If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.

怎么?  你会做什么? 
Why? What will you do?

我会阻止他
I will make him stop.

洛拉斯・提利尔爵士 小姐
Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.

我的妹妹玛格丽邀请你 与她和我们祖母 奥莲娜夫人 一起去花园里游玩
My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens.

要我护送您过去吗? 
May I escort you to them?

你越长越标致了 珊莎小姐
I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.

谢谢您 洛拉斯爵士
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

您也许不记得我们第一次见面了
You probably don't remember the first time we met.

洛拉斯・提利尔
'百花骑士' 御林铁卫

在首相的比武大会上 您献花给我
At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.

这才是属于你的颜色
It's more your color.

拿着 谢谢
You take it. Thank you.

谢谢你 洛拉斯爵士
Thank you, Ser Loras.

珊莎小姐 我很荣幸 介绍我的祖母 提利尔家族的奥莲娜夫人
Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother...  the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.

你真好心 肯来和我及我这群蠢母鸡们共进晚餐
It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.

我们都为你逝去的亲人们感到遗憾
We're very sorry for your losses.

玛格丽小姐 当我听说蓝礼大人的死讯时 的确十分悲伤
And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

他是多么堂皇的人儿啊 没错 他堂皇
He was very gallant. Gallant, yes.

有魅力 澡也洗得干净
And charming and very clean.

他知道如何打扮 如何微笑 从而得出结论自己该当国王
He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.

蓝礼既勇敢又温柔 祖母大人
Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.

父亲和洛拉斯都喜欢他
Father liked him and so did Loras.

洛拉斯还小 善于用木棒把别人敲下马来
Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick.

但这种运动不能让他变聪明
That does not make him wise.

至于你那痴呆的父亲…
As to your fathead father

祖母大人! 这会让珊莎怎么看我们? 
Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?

她会以为我们是一群风趣的人
She might think we have some wits about us.

不管怎么说 至少我们中有一员是这样
One of us, at any rate.

那是叛逆 我警告过他们
It was treason. I warned them.

劳勃有两个儿子 蓝礼还有位兄长
Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.

他怎么能要求 那张丑陋的铁椅子呢
How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?

如果你问我 我得说我们本应和这状该死的愚行保持距离
We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.

不过挤下的乳汁 可不能注回乳房去
But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders.

好了这就是我们看到的这事
So here we are to see things through.

你觉得怎么样 珊莎? 
What do you say to that, Sansa?

来吃点柠檬蛋糕如何? 
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

我最喜欢柠檬蛋糕了
Lemon cake's my favorite.

你这是准备去拿食物呢还是想饿死我们? 
Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death?

来 珊莎 和我坐一起
Here, Sansa, come sit with me.

How are you finding life in the capital?

Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children.

I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.

你敢… 杀生吗? 
Could you...  kill something?

我不知道 陛下 您觉得我能不能呢? 
I don't know, Your Grace. Do you think I could?

您愿意看着我吗? 
Would you like to watch me?

What's he telling him?

你弟弟难道不害臊吗 长这么大还需要你来保护

有些人总是需要别人的帮助

不是说我讨厌喝'洞'里的水 从来都不是 你懂的
Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.

再好听的故事 喝点儿酒听起来也会更有趣
There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.

我节酒那阵子他们都受够了
They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety.

对任何人来说那都无聊透顶
It's very tedious for all concerned.

来说说吧 你们三个小孩子是怎么…
Now, how did three children

像你们三个这样的年轻人 从未受过军事训练 是怎么逃出赫伦堡的? 
How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?

他在铁匠铺里当过学徒
He was apprenticed in the armory.

当过学徒 嗯? 哪个铺子? 
A smith, eh? Where'd you train?

君临 托布・莫特的铺子
King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

那个死家伙 他要价 是城里其他铁匠的两倍
That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.

那是因为他比别的铁匠优秀两倍
That's because he's twice as good.

啊哈! 又当学徒又搞推销
Aha! A smith and a salesman.

詹德利把武器偷出来给我们
Gendry stole us weapons.

啊 从赫伦堡里杀出来一条路啊 我懂了
Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

他知道如何使剑 我也一样
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.

我哥哥教我的
My brothers taught me.

你们可以吃完再动身
You can finish your meals before you go.

路上想见到下一家不知要到什么时候
It may be awhile before you see another.

你会放我们走?  我向你保证
You'll free us? I gave you my word.

但是在你们动身之前 请允许我举杯为你的…
But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your

话说 这可真是少见的大块头啊
Now that is an uncommonly large person.

你们是怎么制服 这么个大个子的? 
How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?

当然是等他喝的烂醉如泥再动手啦
One waits for him to drink until he passes out.

可怜人啊 我都开始同情你了
Poor man. You have my sympathy.

啊哈 这哪是个人啊
Aha, not a man at all.

再次见到你可真好 克里冈
So good to see you again, Clegane.

你他妈在这儿干嘛? 
The fuck you doing here?

喝酒侃大山啊
Drinking and talking too much.

价钱很公道啊 伙计们 是啊!
A pretty prize, lads. Yeah!

七层地狱的 你跟这只史塔克小母狼在干嘛? 
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?

这真是个艰难的决定… 冒着被人发现的风险过桥呢 还是游过宽广的河面
It's a tough decision take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.

闭嘴 弑君者 在桥上任何人都看得到我们 但是从水里游过去 水流可能会把我们卷走 或者 我会趁机顺着水流逃走
Silence, Kingslayer. Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.

看你进退两难真是妙极了
It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.

她会选哪种呢
Which will she choose?

猜都不用猜
Wouldn't have guessed.

我需要歇一会儿 站起来
I need to rest. Get up.

我长了 你知道 走得久了就会长在你脚上的那个东西
I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far.

那些玩意儿叫什么?  立刻站起来
What do you call them? Get up now.

鸡眼 我从来没长过鸡眼
Corns. I never used to get corns.

当然啦 我去哪儿都是骑着马的 不会像个普通的步兵那样 一整年都穿着一双烂靴子走来走去
Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

脚后跟都烂掉了 根本没法…
This heel is ruined. There's no way

我怎么也想不通为什么有些骑士觉得自己需要两把剑
I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.

你步法不错 对于一个大个儿妞儿而言
You move well...  for a great beast of a woman.

你不该在突刺之前把脸绷成那个样
You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.

游戏不是这么玩的
It gives away the game.

对你来说有点不太好办吧
Bit of a quandary for you.

你要是杀了我 就辜负了史塔克夫人
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

但你要是不杀我
But if you don't kill me,

那我就会杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

看吧 你要是想伤害我的话 刚才在那儿你也许就得手了
See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.

看上去你女人比你厉害啊 如果你能管那货叫女人
Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.

我们正打得尽兴呢
We enjoy a good fight.

好好舒活一下筋骨
Gets our juices flowing.

波顿家的剥皮人
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.

就我看来有点毛骨悚然
A bit gruesome for my taste.

你确定他就是那个人?  就是他 没错
You sure he's the one? That's him, all right.

我在威廉・佛雷爵士婚礼的 比武会上见他战斗过
I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

把银子给他吧
Give the man his silver.

放我们走 你想要什么我老爸都会给
Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.

足够我买个新脑袋吗? 
Enough to buy me a new head?

要是北境之王听说我抓住了弑君者 却又放他走了 他当时就会要了我这颗脑袋
If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off.

我倒更希望他要你的脑袋
I'd rather he takes yours.

布林登・徒利
'黑鱼'  凯特琳・徒利之叔

想当初我和一个副官在石磨坊打仗 那可是场…
I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing

你怎么还要提那该死的石磨坊? 
Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill?

还有你别叫他'外甥' 他是你的国王
And don't call him 'nephew.' He is your king.

罗柏知道我并非有意对他不敬…
Robb knows I meant him no disr

我不是你的国王真算你走运
You're lucky I'm not your king.

我不会允许你把自己的蠢行 当成胜利四处宣扬
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.

是我的蠢行让泰温的疯狗 夹着尾巴逃回了凯岩城
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.

我想罗柏国王明白 光他一个人打胜仗 我们是赢不了这场战争的
I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles.

所以 这场胜利的荣耀足够我宣扬了吧
No, there's glory enough to go around.

这与荣耀无关
It's not about glory.

你收到的指令是等他主动出击
Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.

可我抓住了一个机会
I seized an opportunity.

那这磨坊有什么价值吗? 
What value was the mill?

魔山想要从那过河
The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.

当然不在 我们拦截了他
Of course not. We took the fight to him.

他打不过我们
He could not withstand us.

我本想诱敌西入 在我们的地盘上 就可以趁机剿灭他
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him

我故意让他追赶我们 他会这么做的 因为他就是一条没脑子的疯狗
I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head.

我原本可以把他的脑袋插到木桩上
I could have that head on a spike by now.

可是我现在只有个磨坊
Instead, I have a mill.

威廉・兰尼斯特 马丁・兰尼斯特
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

他们两个才 14 岁
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.

我想马丁是 15 岁
Martyn is 15, I believe.

我的两个妹妹在泰温・兰尼斯特手上
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

我有求和吗? 
Have I sued for peace?

那你认为他会 因为他父亲的 兄弟的重孙子来求和吗? 
Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's greatgrandsons?

你们损失了多少人? 
How many men did you lose?

可是我们每战死一人 兰尼斯特就…
But for every man we lost, the Lannisters

我们比泰温更缺人!
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

我不知道  你本该知道
I didn't know.  You would have.

要是刚才我们交流时你能给点耐心
Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.

看起来这里可没几个人有耐心了
We seem to be running short of patience here.

培提尔・贝里席
'小指头' 财政大臣

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

这桌子可真贴心可爱
Intimate. Lovely table.

椅子也比小议会厅的好
Better chairs than the old small council chamber.

跟共事的大臣们也真够近 这我喜欢
Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.

2 万低贱的北方人 都知道他已经失踪了好几周了
20,000 unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks.

总体来说 我们掌握的密探和信息 比其他所有人都多
Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined.

你们是想告诉我 你们当中没有一个人 知道他在哪里吗? 
Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?

我们正在尽力 大人   那就尽全力
We are trying, my lord.  Try harder.

那目前我们知道什么? 
What do we have, then?

罗柏・史塔克还有他大部分军队正在奔流城 给他外祖父霍斯特・徒利举办葬礼
Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

史塔克不在的时候 赫伦堡由卢斯・波顿镇守 这样一来 他就是事实上的赫伦堡公爵 只是少个头衔罢了   随便 让他占着吧
In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.  Well, let him have it.

赫伦堡公爵的头衔 比起一堆废墟来说 对我们更有用
The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.

赫伦堡公爵将会是艾林家寡妇理想的配偶
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

对此我对您心怀感激 大人
For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.

艾林夫人和我青梅竹马
Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.

她总是… 对我有好感
She has always been...  positively predisposed toward me.

如果求婚成功 贝里席大人将会成为谷地的主人
A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

一职生多职 倒是一点都不错
Titles do seem to breed titles.

你要前往艾林谷 越快越好 把莱莎・艾林管住
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

这样少狼主就要把自己的小阿姨给 列为敌人了
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.

我可无意于阻止真爱重逢啊 不过贝里席大人的离开会带来一定的问题
Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems.

国王的婚礼 这项空前浩大的盛事 会因此夭折
The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.

夏天已经结束了 艰苦的日子还在前头呢
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

现在把王室的财务搁置起来可不合适
Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.

所以我要命你担任新的财务大臣
Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.

这将会是最适合你的位置
It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.

花钱我倒是很会 虽然我这辈子都腰缠万贯 但没学会怎么理财
I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.

我一点都不怀疑你会证明自己能胜任这个挑战
I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.

把她举在空中
He lifted her high in the air

他笑着喊着跟着香味在着弄
He sniffed and roared and smelled her there

遍踢遍喊 少女惊恐
She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair

可他舔蜂蜜的发丛
But he licked the honey from her hair

这头儿 那儿弄
From there to here, from here to there

全身黑棕 罩着毛绒
All black and brown and covered with hair

他跟随夏日里的气涌
He smelled that girl in the summer air

狗熊 狗熊 少女美容
The bear, the bear and the maiden fair...

这下你高兴啦
I hope you're pleased.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

如果你当初给我武器 他们就不会把我们抓了
If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.

我们被抓的时候你不是带着武器么
You were armed when we were taken.

你不记得我当时被锁起来了么
I was in chains if you recall.

要不是我的手被捆住了 我们的比试早就结束了
Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.

我从小到大都听到说
All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister,

你比我想象中要慢
You were slower than I expected.

而且也没那么难以预测
And more predictable.

那是因为我在满是淤泥的牢笼里 被铁链锁了整整一年
I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.

我可是个女人 照样把你给打败了
And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.

你可没有打败我
You were not beating me.

或许你是有像人们传说中那么厉害… 曾经是
Maybe you were as good as people said...  once.

或许人们只是喜欢鼓吹有名气的人
Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.

今晚我们扎营的时候 你就会被强奸
When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped.

这些伙计可从没见过贵族女人
None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.

你最好别反抗
You'd be wise not to resist.

是吗?   他们会打断你的牙齿
Would I?  They'll knock your teeth out.

你以为我会在乎自己的牙齿? 
You think I care about my teeth?

不 我不是担心你在乎自己的牙齿
No, I don't think you care about your teeth.

而是如果你反抗 他们会宰了你
If you fight them, they will kill you.

对他们有价值的犯人是我 而不是你
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

他们要怎样就怎样好了 有什么要紧? 
Let them have what they want. What does it matter?

有什么要紧?   闭上你的眼睛
What does it matter?  Close your eyes.

假装他们是蓝礼
Pretend they're Renly.

如果你是个女人 你就不会反抗? 
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

你就会让他们蹂躏? 
You'd let them do what they wanted?

如果我是个女人 我就让他们杀了我
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.

幸亏我不是 感谢诸神
But I'm not, thank the gods.

如果有合适的熔炉 我就可以把它铸得跟新的一样
If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.

詹德利
'大牛' 铁匠学徒

没必要弄的多漂亮
Doesn't have to look pretty.

只要能挡掉射过来的箭就可以了
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.

你为什么要帮他? 
Why are you helping him?

他俘虏我们 现在又成了我们的朋友? 
He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?

你可不是我的俘虏 小小姐
You're not our prisoner, little lady.

那我是什么?   我们的客人
What am I?  Our guest.

没有人把你锁起来
No one's put any chains on you.

那我可以走了么? 
So I can walk away, then?

这片森林对你这个奈德・史塔克的女儿来说可不安全
These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.

被我们找到算你走运
You're lucky we found you.

你以为自己很会用弓嘛 小孬种? 
You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?

比你见过的任何人都要好
Better than anyone you've ever met.

我喜欢近身搏斗
I like to fight up close.

我喜欢在我捅进别人身体的时候看着他的脸
I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.

安盖
'射手' 河湾地的弓箭手

为什么? 那你就可以吻他了? 
Why? So you can kiss him?

你还记得上一次你在这儿的时候? 
You remember the last time you were here?

跟路上遇到的破烂酒馆都一个样
Looks like every other shit inn on the road.

不好意思 但是你实在太他妈丑了 还是不要让我看见你的脸
Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.

你干嘛呢?  我们要走了
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

我给酒馆老板烤了些黄面包 她说这是她吃过最好的
I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better.

她告诉索罗斯要把我留下 作为一直给他提供免费食物的报酬
Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him.

反正兄弟会又不想要我
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.

我的兄弟可不是国王
My brother ain't no king.

我也不是凝冬城的史塔克
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

还有 这个是给你做的
Well, I made you something.

你也… 别烧到手指
You don't...  burn your fingers.

上马吧 小小姐
Up you go, little lady.

某人居然忘记了有仗在打 这可不好原谅啊
A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.

对于世界上大部分地方来说 即便处于战争最黑暗的时期 也根本什么都没有发生 这样想常会让我心里安慰许多
It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.

我很想念你 叔叔
I've missed you, Uncle.

你离开这么久 父亲也很想念你
Father missed you, too, from the day you left.

或许他从来没有说出来过…
Maybe he never said it in so many words

你父亲是头顽固的老公牛
Your father was a stubborn old ox.

他死的时候我很惊讶
I was surprised when he died.

还以为死神对他没有那个耐性
Didn't think death had the patience.

你当时能陪在他身边实在太好了
I'm glad you were with him.

我多希望诸神让我当时也能在场
I wish to the gods I had been.

你们最终和解了吗? 
Did you make peace in the end?

吵了三十年
After 30 years of fighting,

大概他已经不记得最初是因为什么了
I don't think he remembered what started it.

他叫我别再自称黑鱼
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.

他说那是个老掉牙的笑话 而且从一开始就不好笑
He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.

我告诉他 人们早已习惯叫我黑鱼 这么长时间之后 我的本名都被忘了
I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.

每次他离开奔流城去君临 或者去参加比武大会
Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign,

他会说 '等着我回来 小凯特'
'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say.

'等着我 我很快就会回来的'
'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.'

每天太阳升起的时候 我就坐在这个窗边等他
And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting.

我常常想 布兰和瑞肯有多少次 在眺望临冬城的旷野 等着我回去
I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return.

我再也见不到他们了
I will never see them again.

别这么想
You mustn't think it.

我们还不知道确切情况
We don't know the truth.

他们可能藏起来了
They could be in hiding.

罗柏相信他们还活着
Robb believes they're alive.

他坚信这一点
And he must go on believing.

要打胜仗罗柏必须坚强
He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.

你为了他也要坚强下去
And you must remain strong for him.

你是罗柏・史塔克的妻子
You're Robb Stark's wife.

他们说的他那些事是真的吗? 
Is it true what they say about him?

我不知道 他们说他什么? 
I don't know. What do they say about him?

说他晚上会变成一头狼
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

还说他会生吃敌人的血肉
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

你是个兰尼斯特 是么? 
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

你不必害怕
You've nothing to fear.

我丈夫不吃小孩
My husband doesn't eat children.

除非是满月
Unless it's a full moon.

今天晚上不是满月吧? 
It's not a full moon tonight, is it?

耶哥蕊特
'火吻而生' 野人

你不是说有不少死乌鸦嘛
You said there was dead crows.

欧瑞尔
'鹰眼' 易形者

一共有多少人
How many men were here?

你知道这些人现在怎么样吗? 
And you know what those men are now?

对异鬼来说我们都一样… 他们军队的食物
We're all the same to them meat for their army.

你觉得有没有人逃走了? 
Do you think anyone got away?

莫尔蒙不容轻视
You don't go far betting against Mormont.

但无论是死是活 他北上的这一场豪赌
But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north.

他手下最能打的人全都死了
His best fighting men are dead.

不管他是守夜人军团的司令官 还是一具蓝眼睛的尸体 他都离长城远得很
And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blueeyed corpse, he's a long way from home.

带上欧瑞尔 挑 20 个好手
Take Orell and 20 good men.

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人掠袭者

黑城堡的防御他比我们所有人都熟
He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us.

如果他有用 那当然好 否则… 把他从城墙上扔下去
And if he's useful, good. If not...  throw him off the Wall.

看看乌鸦到底会不会飞
See if crows can fly.

终于要打仗了吗 老朋友? 
We're finally going to war, old friend?

在黑城堡附近藏起来
Hide near Castle Black.

收到我的信号之后 趁晚上偷袭他们
When I give the signal, hit them in the night.

他们可以依着巨大的长城防守 但是长城只能防守北面
They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.

我们会再见面的  没错
We'll meet again.  Aye.

只要你事情办妥了  哈
If you do your job.  Ah.

我们怎么收到你的信号? 
How will we see your signal?

每天晚上让你的鹰飞到长城上方
Send your eagle above the Wall every night.

时机到了 我会点燃北境所见过的 最大的一团火焰
When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.

瞧瞧这是什么? 冻僵的乌鸦? 
What have we here? Frozen crows?

我们赶了很远的路
We've come a long way.

比你来时少了很多人啊
Smaller flock than you went north with.

杰奥・莫尔蒙
'熊老' 守夜人总司令

他们需要些水
They need some water.

把它拴起来 我马上进来
Tether it and I'll be inside.

管好你们的眼睛
Keep your eyes where they belong.

我敢说你喂猪的食物也比给我们的好
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.

没错 猪对我来说有用
Aye, pig's got value to me.

我让你们进来你们就该亲我的脚了
You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.

如果我不是个信神的人我早让你们全滚蛋了
I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.

是的 我不害怕外面发生什么
I am. I got no fear of what's out there.

当白色寒神来临时 你们的剑和斗篷还有他妈的火堆都帮不了你
When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you.

只有信对了神的人才能活下来
The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods.

去告诉她 要么咬个破布 要么就等着我的拳头
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist.

那只母猪就在那 生了八只小猪
That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.

她也就跟这家伙差不多肥
And she's almost as fat as this one here.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪'  守夜人事务官

你们怎么不吃了他? 
Now why don't you dine on him?

走的时候切下几块来带走
Carve off what you need as you go.

看看他 根本就是会走路的美食嘛
Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

给我磨锋利点 好吗? 
Sharpen these for me, would ya?

我看到头了 用力
I see the head. Push.

再用点力就生出来了
One more push should do it.

男孩女孩? 男孩女孩? 
What is it? What is it?

如果你不能骑马 我们就完了
If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.

往东骑 跟着升起的太阳
Ride east. Follow the rising sun.

你姐姐在等着你
Your sister's waiting for you.

我会报答你的 我会封你做铁群岛的头领
I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.

我们可不在铁群岛
We're not in the Iron Islands.

你不打算告诉我你要去哪? 
You refuse to tell me where you're going?

我还不知道 圣火会指示我的
I don't know yet. The fires will show me.

你会去多久?   我不知道
How long will you be gone?  I don't know.

你要抛弃我
You're abandoning me.

我绝对不会抛弃你
I will never abandon you.

你是圣焰之子
You are the Son of Fire.

我发誓效忠于你   那就留下
I am sworn to serve you.  Then serve me.

当我回来的时候 你会明白的
When I return, you will understand.

敌人认为我已经被彻底击败了
My enemies think they've destroyed me.

他们在嘲笑我 像蓝礼那样嘲笑我
They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me.

我要罗柏・史塔克死
I want Robb Stark dead.

你的力量不足 这会害死你的
You don't have the strength. It would kill you.

我没有那么容易死 人们想杀我很久了
I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.

你的火焰燃烧得很微弱 国王陛下
Your fires burn low, my king.

还有其它的办法 更好的办法
There is another way. A better way.

你说过你的魔法需要国王之血才能施放
You told me your magic requires a king's blood.

是的  而我是唯一真正的国王
Yes.  I'm the one true king.

但是还有人的血管里 也流淌着您的血
But there are others with your blood in their veins.

您终将称王于铁王座 但在此之前 必须要做出牺牲
You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices.

光之王需要祭品
The Lord of Light demands it.

这条惩罚之路是一个警告 陛下
The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.

给谁的警告?   给任何像这些人一样 胆敢犯罪的奴隶
To whom?  To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.

卡丽熙 这人是个死刑犯
Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.

离开这儿吧 陛下
Leave this place, Your Grace.

今晚就走 我恳求您
Leave tonight, I beg you.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 熊老之子

那招兵的事儿怎么办? 
And what is she to do for soldiers?

我们可以在潘托斯和密尔找到雇佣兵
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

你已经开始说'我们'了 巴利斯坦爵士? 
Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan?

如果想重回祖先的王座 您只能武力夺取
If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.

这意味着在此之前 您的手上将会沾满鲜血
That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.

沾满敌人的血 而不是无辜者的
The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.

你打过几次仗 巴利斯坦爵士? 
How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

三次  你见过的战争中 哪次没有牺牲成千上万的无辜者? 
Three.  Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?

君临陷落的时候我在场 卡丽熙
I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi.

你猜我看到了什么?  屠杀
You know what I saw? Butchery.

婴儿 孩童 老人全都惨遭毒手
Babies, children, old men.

遭强暴的妇女更是无法尽数
More women raped than you can count.

每个人心中都有一头狂暴的野兽 只要武器交到他手中 那头野兽便会蠢蠢欲动
There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

但无垢者不是人
But the Unsullied are not men.

除非指挥官明确下令 他们不会劫掠城市
They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so.

如果您买下他们 他们会只杀您想杀的人
If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.

你不这样认为吗 巴利斯坦爵士? 
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

当您的兄长雷加 率领军队在三叉戟河作战时 人们为他而死 是因为他们信任他 因为他们爱他 而并非因为他们在拍卖会上 被卖给了他
When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction.

那一天 我曾与最后的真龙并肩作战 陛下
I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace.

雷加战斗得英勇 雷加战斗得高贵 雷加死得不明不白
Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.

你很了解雷加吗 巴利斯坦爵士? 
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

是的 陛下 他是我见过的最好的人
I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

我希望我也能认识他
I wish I had known him.

但他并非最后的真龙
But he was not the last dragon.

小人听错了吗 陛下? 
Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?

你没有 我要买下所有的无垢者
They did not. I want to buy them all.

阿斯塔波一共有 8000 名无垢者
There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.

这就是您指的'所有的'? 
Is this what you mean by all?

仍在训练中的也包括在内
And the ones still in training as well.

格雷赞主人说他们不能出售未完成训练的男孩
Master Greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys.

如果他们在战场上失败 那会让整个阿斯塔波的名声受损
If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

如果你们不全数卖给我 我就一个也不买
I will have them all or take none.

如果他们在战斗中死亡
Many will fall in battle.

我需要那些男孩作为替补继续战斗
I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.

克拉兹尼主人说您付不起这么多钱
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.

您的船可以换来 100 名无垢者
Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.

这还是出于克拉兹尼主人的慷慨大方
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

您剩下的金子只能买下 10 名
The gold you have left is worth 10.

但善良的克拉兹尼主人会卖给您 20 名
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.

您带领的多斯拉克人…
The Dothraki you have with you

您带领的多斯拉克人 还不如他们吃掉的东西有价值 但是克拉兹尼主人会用 3 名无垢者 来交换这些人
The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.

克拉兹尼主人想要知道您想如何支付 剩下 7877 名无垢者的价格
Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 Unsullied.

我还有龙 我可以给你们一条
I have dragons. I'll give you one.

您应当用您的龙 而不是奴隶 来夺回王座 陛下
You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

他们想要最大的那一条
They want the biggest one.

我还要把你也带走 就现在
I'll take you as well, now.

你将会是克拉兹尼主人送给我的礼物
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.

一个讨价还价的战利品
A token of a bargain well struck.

卡丽熙 一条龙的价值比任何军队都高
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.

伊耿・坦格利安早就证明过这一点
Aegon Targaryen proved that.

你们都是来给我出谋划策的
You're both here to advise me.

我重视你们的建议 但如果你们再次 在他人面前质疑我 你们就另谋高就吧
I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else.

小人名叫弥桑黛 陛下
This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.

你有家人吗? 如果可能回家的话 有在家等你的父母吗? 
Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?

没有 陛下 我的家人都不在了
No, Your Grace. No family living.

那从现在起你属于我了 你的职责就是告诉我真相
You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.

是的 陛下 欺骗是重罪
Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.

很多惩罚之路上的罪人 犯得罪甚至比这要轻得多
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.

在惩罚之路上 我给了一名濒死的奴隶一些水喝
I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment.

你知道他对我说了什么吗?  '让我死吧'
Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'

死了之后就没有奴隶主虐待他们了 陛下
There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.

关于无垢者的事情 克拉兹尼说的是真的吗? 他们真的绝对服从? 
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

他们不会心生疑虑
All questions have been taken from them.

只会服从 别无二意
They obey, that is all.

一旦被您买下 他们就属于您
Once they are yours, they are yours.

就算您命令他们自杀 他们也会照做
They will fall on their swords if you command it.

那你呢? 你知道么 我将把你带入战场
And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war.

是的 男人皆有一死
Yes, all men must die.

用这地儿来保管王室账单 还真是出人意料啊
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.

你这么惊讶才让真是出人意料
I'm surprised you're surprised.

这是全城最安全的地方
This is the safest place in the city.

所有的都在这里了 大人
That's all of them, my lord.

谢谢 亲爱的 波德
Thank you, my dear. Pod.

波德 把它们拿出去
Pod. Take them outside.

我随后就会到  好的 大人
I'll be there in a moment.  Yes, my lord.

我听说你欠那个男孩很大一笔债
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

恐怕没有你说的那么大
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

你应当封他为骑士
You should have him knighted.

如果财政大臣有这权力 我一定会的
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

我也欠你很大一笔债
I owe you a significant debt.

我们红头发的朋友
Our redheaded friend.

是你把她从太后手里保释出来的
You secured her release when the queen detained her.

当然了 那只是个小误会
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

显然 太后陛下认为 你们二人的关系非同一般
Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.

我们没有 我干过她一次
We don't. I did fuck her once.

我知道  但我们没有别的关系
I know.  But we don't.

但为什么太后会这样想? 
But how would the queen get that idea?

你怎么不问她呢? 
Why don't you ask her?

对于我的新职务 你有什么建议吗? 
Any advice for me on my new position?

如果每次我听到这个笑话 都可以得到一枚金龙 我现在就比你更有钱了
If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

你本来就比我更有钱
Well, you are richer than I am.

它们只是数字 纸上的数字
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.

一旦你理解了这一点 你可以很轻松地控制它们
Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave.

你想要接受真正的挑战吗? 
You want a real challenge?

我可没少尝试过
I've tried quite a few.

我还有好多事情要做
Well, lots of work to do.

来嘛 我晚点儿再来
Come on, I'm here later.

似乎是些很无聊的读物
Looks like dull reading.

在你看来所有的读物都很无聊吧
You think all reading is dull reading.

不只是我 很多色的人都这么想
It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.

七国历史上那些不为人知的故事 都藏在这些书页里
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.

除非山羊胡大人编造了一串数字 来掩盖他的真实目的
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.

除非这全是他胡编乱造的 是的
Unless he made it all up, yes.

波德瑞克 跟紧我们  是的 大人
Podrick, do keep up.  Yes, my lord.

波德瑞克  是的 大人? 
Podrick.  Yes, my lord?

在与我的朋友波隆爵士 商量了许久之后
After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn,

我终于想到了一个合适的方法 来奖赏你这段时间 为我提供的优质服务
I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.

告诉我 波德 你曾经和女人睡过吗? 
Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?

没有 大人  太好了
No, my lord.  Wonderful.

吉娜最擅长对付处男了
Genna specializes in firsttimers.

当然对付非处男也不错
She's not bad with secondtimers, either.

在我差点被杀的时候 你把长矛刺那人的脸里 作为救我的奖励 这还挺不错的 你觉得呢? 
A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my wouldbe killer's face, wouldn't you say?

玛丽… 她的身体滑如矛柄
Marei...  is quite the spear handler herself.

这是为了感谢你在战火纷飞的时候 一直守在我的身边
She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.

你可没告诉过我他有这么帅气
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

在这个圈子里 凯拉的名气甚至远扬至瓦兰提斯
Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.

她是世上仅有的四位 可以完成弥林结的女人之一
One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

大人 我还是个…
My lord, I don't even...

你总是称呼我为'大人' 叫她来是为了感谢 你这样出色的侍从的
She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.'

在我进晚餐之前回来
Be back in time for my supper.

这些年来我一直听说 小指头会变戏法
For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.

无论何时国王需要钱 他只消双手一搓 噗 金山银海就出现了
Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.

让我猜猜 他不会变戏法
Let me guess. He's not a magician.

他的钱是偷来的?   更糟 是借来的
He's stealing it?  Worse, he's borrowing it.

那有什么问题? 
What's wrong with that?

我们偿还不起 这就是问题所在
We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.

铁王座欠了我父亲几百万金龙
The crown owes millions to my father.

看在他的孙子坐着铁王座的份上
Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne,

我猜他会免除这些债务
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

免除债务 我的父亲大人? 
Forgive a debt, my father?

亏你还能活在这个世上 你还真是出奇的天真
For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.

我以前从来没借过钱
I've never borrowed money before.

我又不懂这方面的道道
I'm not clear on the rules.

基本的原则是
The basic principle is

我借给你钱 在商定的时间过去之后 你要连本带利的返还给我
I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.

这就是为啥我不会借钱给你
This is why I don't lend you money.

总之 我担心的不是我父亲
Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.

我担心的是布拉佛斯的铁金库
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

我欠了他们几千万金龙
We owe them tens of millions.

如果我们还不上这份债务 铁金库就会赞助我们的敌人
If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.

无论通过何种手段 他们总会拿回属于他们的钱
One way or another, they always get their gold back.

啊 我们的征服英雄回来了
Ah, the return of the conquering hero.

他是不是刚旅游回来? 
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

这小伙都快跳起舞来了
The lad's practically skipping.

你花了挺长时间
You were gone a long time.

我相信你的钱没白花
I trust you got your money's worth.

或者我应该说我的钱没白花? 
Or should I say my money's worth?

哦 这是个礼物 波德瑞克
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.

这比我一整年给你的都多
This is more than I give you in a year.

他是个侍从 你不用付他钱
He's a squire. You don't pay him.

哦 那这比我一整年给你的要多得多
Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.

她们没要钱 大人
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

或许她们想要和新上任的财政大臣 套套近乎
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.

你听说过有妓女拒绝金子的吗? 
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?

只要我给她们 她们就非常开心
They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.

你跟她们说什么了? 
What did you tell them?

我什么也没说
I didn't tell them anything.

你对她们做什么了?   挺多花样的
What did you do to them?  Lots of things.

那她们看上去挺喜欢这些花样的? 
And they seemed to like these things?

她们当然会看上去挺喜欢的
Of course they seemed to like it.

付钱就是为了让她们假装喜欢的
They're paid to seem to like it.

但是她们这次没拿钱
Only they weren't paid.

你在说什么呢? 姑娘们很喜欢他 所以她们这次免费为他服务
What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?

这就是你想说的吗? 
Is that what you're telling us?

我们需要谈谈细节
We're going to need details.

你知道我们是怎么处理逃亡者的 是吧? 
You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?

我要把你操进地里
I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

不 求你了! 不 不 不!
No, please! No, no, no!

你离家很远了 况且凛冬将至
You're a long way from home and winter is coming.

我要先干那个大个儿婊子
I'll take the big bitch first.

当她又湿又爽的时候 你们就能了结了她
When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.

大人 我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.

凯特琳・史塔克夫人命我 将詹姆爵士送到君临城
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.

凯特琳・史塔克是个大逆不道的贱人
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.

上头就吩咐过活捉弑君者
Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.

没他妈提过你
Nobody said shit about you.

这可是你自找的
You're only making it worse.

把她带到暗处去
Take her over there where it's dark.

我可不想被人看着
I'd like a little privacy.

你知道她是谁 对吧? 
You know who she is, don't you?

大个蠢婊子, 谁管她哪来的
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.

大到根本算不上是个女人
Never been with a woman that big.

她是塔斯的布蕾妮
She's Brienne of Tarth.

塞尔温・塔斯伯爵的女儿
Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

我要割了你的喉咙!
I'm gonna cut your throat!

人们管那儿叫'蓝宝石之岛' 知道为什么吗? 
They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?

维斯特洛的所有蓝宝石 都产自塔斯岛
Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.

蓝宝石是一种宝石
Sapphires are gemstones.

蓝色的那种  这个我明白
The blue ones.  I know what they are.

如果你把她送回去 塞尔温伯爵会付给你和她一样重的蓝宝石作为赎金
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him.

但必须是活着的 并且清誉无损
But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.

站起来 走过来
Come on, on your feet.

讲究人说讲究话哈
Fancy word for a fancy man.

我小时候很讨厌读书 但我父亲逼着我每天早上起来念书 直到我可以练剑骑马
I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse.

每天被闷在学士的屋子里两个小时
Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers.

我学了很多文绉绉的语言
I learned a lot of fancy words.

你老爹 会付和你一般重的金子赎你回来? 
Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?

你下半辈子都会很富有的
You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.

你的儿子们也会很富有 你的孙子们也是
And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them.

封地 爵位… 都会有的
Lands, titles you'll have them all.

北境赢不了这场战争的
The North can't win this war.

你是个聪明人 你知道这点
You're a smart man. You understand that.

我们兵多将广 我们国库丰盈
We have the numbers. We have the gold.

为了一个终将失败的目标奋勇作战 是令人钦佩的
Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable.

为了一个最终胜利的目标作战 则更为有利可图
Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.

这倒真得承认
Hard to argue with that.

那我们敞开天窗说亮话
Now that we're speaking together man to man,

我很怀疑你需要把我锁在这棵树上
I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree.

我不是要求松绑 但如果我能躺着睡下 我的背会很感激的
I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it.

我不再像曾经那样 年轻而有活力了
I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.

把詹姆爵士从树上放下来
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

我觉得你可能想填填肚子? 
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

实际上 我快饿死了
I'm famished, actually.

我想火堆上还多了一只烤鹧鸪
I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.

呃 我喜欢鹧鸪
Well, I do like partridge.

把那些鸟拿过来 还有切肉刀
Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.

这能当您的餐桌吗 大人? 
Will this work as a table, my lord?

哦 好的 好的 这样感觉很… 啊!
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic ah!

你觉得你是这里面脑瓜子最灵光的? 
You think you're the smartest man there is.

每个人都得点头哈腰 舔你的靴子
That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

我父亲…   无论你遇上任何麻烦 只要报上你父亲的大名 就能拍屁股走人
My father  And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

不要  你有什么要说的吗? 
Don't.  Have you got something to say?

小心点 话可别乱说
Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing.

没你爹你屁都不是 而他恰好不在呢
You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

这个应该能让你长点记性
Here, this should help you remember.

你觉得他的屁股里
How many of those fingers

詹姆·兰尼斯特 能塞进多少根儿手指啊? 
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长 do you think we could shove up his ass?

这可得看他之前有没有练习过
Depends if he's had any practice.

布蕾妮·塔斯
'美人' 凯特琳的护卫

你跟你姐姐搞的时候玩过这种花样吗?  弑君者? 
Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

她可曾替我们松过你的菊花? 
She loosened you up for us?

他要从马上摔下来了 来人帮帮他啊
He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.

如果我死了 你就什么也…
If I die, you won't be getting

还真没见过有人连喝马尿都喝的这么带劲呐
Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.

胆敢再犯 我就剁了你的另一只手
Do that again and I'll take your other hand.

提利昂·兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 财政大臣

哦 提利昂大人 进来 进来
Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

我希望咱俩能够
I hope we might speak.

哦 咱不一直都推心置腹的嘛
Oh, always in confidence.

关于黑水河的那档子事儿
About the events of the Blackwater.

现在谈这个是否有些不合时宜? 
Perhaps this is the wrong time?

哦 不 我看正合时宜
Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.

我觉得没准你的某只小小鸟 知道点什么 关于我姐姐图谋…
I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to

虽然我接过了小指头的职位 但他可没把那些耳目眼线一并留给我
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid.

所以我只能来找你帮忙
Which is why I'm coming to you.

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

还会有审判么?  是我想知道而已
Will there be a trial? I need to know.

她曾对我密语 可我没有别的证据
I have no proof, only whispers.

在讨论这些见不得人的东西前
Before all this nastiness,

我本想跟你讲讲我是如何被阉的
I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.

你现在还想听么? 
Do you want to hear it still?

当我还是个男孩的时候 我曾跟着一个剧团 在自由城邦巡演
As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.

有一天 在密尔 一个男人给我的主人开了一个 无法拒绝的高价
One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.

我很害怕 担心这男人会怎样对我 他会不会是那种对男童感兴趣的人
I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys.

然而事实比这更糟
But what he wanted was far worse.

他对我下了药 那药水让我无法动弹 甚至无法言语 可它却没有麻痹我的感觉
He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.

他用一柄弯刀 将我的那里连根带梢 一片一片的切下 然后他伴着咒语
With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.

将它们丢入火盆中烧掉
He burned my parts in a brazier.

火焰转而变蓝 然后我听到有个声音响应了他的召唤
The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.

如今我仍会时不时的梦到它…
I still dream of that night.

梦到的不是那个巫师 也不是那把刀
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.

而是那个火焰里的声音
I dream of the voice from the flames.

那是个神祗?  还是恶魔? 
Was it a god? A demon?

但是确实有个声音响应了巫师的召唤
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.

从那天起
And ever since that day,

我开始憎恨一切魔法 和使用它们的人
I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

这就是为什么我要如此热切的帮助你 对抗史坦尼斯和他的红袍女祭司
But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess.

这算是某种复仇的象征
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

是的 嗯… 我急不可耐地要跟那些 想置我于死地的人来一场 真刀真枪的复仇
Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed.

但是这事儿没点影响力可办不到 而这些…
Which will require a degree of influence, which

恰是你此时此刻 所不具备的
You do not possess at the moment.

说到影响力 我发现这玩意儿 实际上就是耐性的较量
But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.

那巫师利用完我以后 便把我丢出门外 让我自生自灭
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.

可我恨他 我偏要活下去
I resolved to live to spite him.

不惜出卖自己剩下的那部分身体
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.

直到我变成了一个颇有手段的窃贼 很快 我发现 一个人信里的东西 往往比他钱包里的更值钱
I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.

于是我一步一步忍着 忍着完成一个又一个令人恶心的任务
Step by step, one distasteful task after another,

终于我爬出了密尔的贫民窟 坐到了御前议会的桌前
I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.

影响力如同野草 火烧不尽 风吹又生
Influence grows like a weed.

我以耐心灌溉之 才使其能绵延繁茂如今 从红堡檐下 一路不绝 爬到世界的尽头 所以我才能够在这野草之下 藏得住那些… 特别的东西
I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.

你好啊 老朋友
Hello, my old friend.

好久不见啊
It's been a long time.

我坚信 相报有时 而你的仇 终将得偿… 只要你念念不忘 耐心等待
I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time...  if you have the stomach for it.

从来没听说过 守夜人还要铲土的…
When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.

它们总是拿什么荣誉 赦免来说事儿 还有保卫王国 但其实铲土才是最主要的部分吧
They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.

还有遇袭 被杀 甚至更糟
And getting attacked or killed or worse.

诸如此类 当没有遇袭 被杀的时候 基本上都在铲土
And that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.

艾迪森·托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

我在想今天剩下的时间 要做些什么了
I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.

我们得离开这儿
We need to get out of here.

当司令官大人说走的时候 我们才能走
When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.

司令官大人曾让我们去先民拳峰
The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.

结果呢?  可是他也不知道会变成这样啊
How'd that turn out for us? He had no way of knowing.

我们知道那有些什么玩意儿了
We know what's out there.

卡斯特在这儿都能生存下来
Craster's been out here surviving.

所以他现在成了你的新任监护人了? 
So he's your new protector now?

我们的好朋友卡斯特? 
Our good friend Craster?

我们就跟他那些丢掉的儿子一样
We're like the sons he never had.

莫尔蒙救不了你
Mormont isn't gonna save you.

这些蠢货也救不了你
This lummox here isn't gonna save you.

只要异鬼一句话
When the walkers come calling,

卡斯特立刻就会把咱们当猪一样献祭出去
Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.

如果我们还想要命… 我们就得为自己打算
If we want to live...  we'll have to look out for ourselves.

你吵醒他了 对不起
You woke him. I'm sorry.

没有 你要给他起名吗? 
No. Are you going to give him one?

你说在你回来之前 让我替你保管它
You said to hold it for you until you came back.

你现在回来了 我希望你能留着它
You're back. I wanted you to have it.

我才不想要这傻乎乎的顶针
I don't want your stupid thimble.

我想要救我孩子的命 你能做到吗? 
I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that?

我没空搭理你
I don't have time for you.

除了他 我没空搭理任何人 因为他没多少时间了
I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.

你得去找他
You have to go after him.

我跟你说过多少次了
How many times have I told you?

不要攀爬 妈妈 我得找到它
No climbing. Mother, I need to find it.

它就在这儿 它在召唤我 你得向我保证
It's here. It's calling me. I want you to promise me.

别再爬了 答应我
No more climbing. Promise me.

答应我! 答应我!
Promise me! Promise me!

妈妈! 妈妈! 答应我! 答应我 布兰!
Mother! Mother! Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

看起来也没大多少
No larger than usual, apparently.

不过她们说他…  不同寻常
And yet they said that he wasExtraordinary.

她们所见过的最特别的男人
The most extraordinary man they've ever had.

她们可是阅人无数
And they've had a lot of men.

我们说的是同一个波德瑞克吗? 
We're talking about the same Podrick?

给提利昂大人当侍从的那个闷小子? 
The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service?

他对她们做了什么? 
What did he do to them?

这我可不知道 大人
I don't know, my lord.

这群姑娘们通常很会夸夸其谈的不是么
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

她们怎么说的? 
So what did they say?

她们说这回不太好解释
They said it was hard to describe.

人才出现在了最古怪的地方
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

那小指头呢? 对他的损失有什么反应? 
And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?

他太忙了 才没空管这些
He was too preoccupied to notice.

他即将动身去鹰巢城了
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.

我在帮他打点行装
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

啊是啊 去追求他与艾林夫人不朽的爱情 还有那随她而来的名号
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.

这就让我们的朋友 对可怜的珊莎·史塔克失去兴趣了么? 
Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?

自从上次之后他就没和她再交谈过了 至少据我所知如此
He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.

我倒不认为他失去兴趣了
But I don't think he's lost interest.

你怎么知道
What makes you say so?

他的登船清单 噢
His shipboard inventory. Ah.

干咱们这行的姑娘中这还真少见
Rare for a woman in your profession.

老本行 当然
Former profession. Of course.

对了我们还是回归正题吧 你刚才想说什么来着? 
I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?

他要把两张羽毛床搬到床上
He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.

除了小指头自己 还能有谁这么重要 得劳驾小指头带上羽毛床? 
Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger?

可能他带着他的一个姑娘? 
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

他对她们可没兴趣 大人
He's not interested in them, my lord.

因为我就是她们中的一个
Because I'm one of his girls.

真是怪处出人才
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

雷妮拉·坦格利安是被她弟弟所谋害的 或者说是她弟弟的龙
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon.

这野兽在她儿子面前吃了她
It ate her while her son watched.

这下面地穴里埋着的 是她被吃剩的残尸
What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.

遵照传统婚礼将会在大圣堂里举行 那里摆得下 700 个座位
The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably.

看起来应该在厅里再安排些席位 以接纳其它的来客
There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.

可我们要宴请的贵宾只有 700 个啊
There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.

的确 剩下的都是来捧人场的 让那 700 个人意识到自己 是有多么的荣幸才能位列贵席
No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.

在那个瓮里的是 伊里昂·坦格利安的骨灰
Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

人称'明焰'伊里昂
Aerion Brightflame they called him.

他相信喝下野火就能变成真龙
He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.

当然 那儿还有疯王 我舅舅杀死的那个
And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.

你想看看最后的坦格利安被埋在哪里吗? 
Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?

你确定玛格丽小姐不会觉得这有点恐怖吗? 
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

哦 不会 没有什么的 陛下
Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace.

我很想看看他们的墓穴
I'd love to see their tombs, really.

就像是在历史中漫步一样
It's like taking a walk through history.

墓穴就在那里 –真是让人激动
The tomb's just up here. This is so exciting.

您是在这里成婚的么 陛下? 
You were married here, Your Grace?

是的 一定就像是昨天一样
Yes. Must seem like only yesterday.

就像是上辈子的事情
Seems like a lifetime ago.

您的亡夫 也埋葬在这里吗? 
Your husband, was he buried here as well?

不 他希望将遗骨葬在风息堡
No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.

真是个悲剧 一个显而易见的悲剧
Such a tragedy. A fairly predictable tragedy.

打猎的时候怎么能够酗酒
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

我儿子是个猎人 这总是让他忘记 自己从未接近过真刀真枪的战争
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.

可我记得他曾经围攻过风息堡 围城了大半年了
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.

他围攻的 不过是他大帐里的宴席而已
All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.

我警告过他别参与劳勃的叛乱
I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.

他根本没那个实力 去和真正的战士较量
He had no business fighting an actual warrior.

我们这些母亲总是极尽所能地 让自己的儿子远离死亡
We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.

不过他们却为之乐此不疲
But they do seem to yearn for it.

我们灌输给他们的理智 像羽翼上的雨滴一样潸然流走
We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.

可现实是 这世道是属于他们的
And yet the world belongs to them.

真是个荒唐的安排啊
A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.

也许七神认为这是合适的安排吧
The gods have seen fit to make it so.

我父亲不希望他们留在这里
My father didn't want them here.

他要烧了他们的遗体 然后丢进黑水河去 不过大主教让他改了主意
He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.

很抱歉 陛下
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

我明白他们最后做了很糟糕的事 但是他们的祖先建造了这个城堡
I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this.

有的时候疯狂 是换取伟大的代价
Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.

感同身受
I couldn't agree more.

我们要去看他们吗? 
Shall we go and see them?

如果你给予他们爱 他们会千万倍的奉还
If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold.

我和他们交谈过
I've spoken with them.

我知道他们怎么看待你
I know how they feel about you.

你领导了君临的防御战
You led the defense of King's Landing.

玛格丽小姐! 玛格丽小姐!
Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery!

祝福你 玛格丽小姐!
Bless you, Lady Margaery!

玛格丽小姐! 玛格丽小姐!
Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery!

玛格丽! 玛格丽小姐万岁!
Margaery! Long live Lady Margaery!

乔佛里国王! 乔佛里国王!
King Joffrey! King Joffrey!

七神祝福乔佛里国王!
Gods bless King Joffrey!

离深林堡还有多远? 
How far is it to Deepwood Motte?

你的姐姐在那等你
Your sister is waiting for you there.

她派你来救我的?  没错
She sent you to save me? Yes.

我曾为那些折磨你的人效命
I served them, the men who were torturing you.

我照他们说的去做 直到时机成熟
I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.

你为什么要为我冒险? 
Why would you risk your life for me?

我是在盐崖岛长大的 大人
I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.

他们把你带走的时候我还是个小孩
I was only a boy when they took you away.

我的父亲把我和我的兄弟们带到断崖上 我们目送载着你的船离去
My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off.

我还记得我父亲的神情 当他说
I remember the look on my father's face when he told us,

当我看到他们折磨你的时候 这些话就在我的脑中回响个不停
And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.

那些人 他们说我父亲知道他们对我做什么
Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me.

我…  我不知道 大人
II don't know, my lord.

他们…  他们从来不会告诉我很多
Theythey never told me much.

我姐姐的人都很忠诚
My sister's men are loyal to her.

我不需要躲躲藏藏的
We don't need to hide from them.

可并不是所有的人都是你姐姐的部下
Not all those are your sister's men.

还有些人是忠于你父亲的
Some of them are loyal to your father.

只是在想那时我是如何被妒火吞没的 当我听到父亲命令雅拉攻打这里的时候
I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.

他给你安排了什么任务? 
What did he tell you to do?

去掠夺渔村
Raid fishing villages.

他认为我是个史塔克
Thought I was a Stark.

呵呵 我永远都不会成为史塔克
Ha. I could never be a Stark.

罗柏·史塔克总是提醒我这点
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.

他曾经凌驾于你之上么?  他没这个必要
He lorded it over you? Didn't have to.

他只需顺其自然就够了
All he had to do was be.

他生来就高人一等
Be who he was born to be.

他的人生是如此的一帆风顺
His life fit him better than his clothes.

像他这样的人 又怎么会拿我当兄弟呢? 
How could someone like that ever be a brother to me?

他可是北境之王
He's the King in the North.

而我… 我父亲给了我一个选择 我也做出了决定
And me...  my father gave me a choice and I made it.

我不可能成为一个史塔克
I could never be a Stark.

我是个铁种 这才是我生来的命运
But ironborn, that's what I was born to be.

我付铁钱换来了临冬城
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.

我谋杀了那两个男孩
I murdered those boys.

我杀的不过是农夫家养的可怜孤儿
Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.

我让达格摩割了他们的喉咙 然后让他们烧掉尸体 这样我就能占有临冬城 让我父亲骄傲
I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies...  so I could keep Winterfell...  and make my father proud.

也许还不算太晚
Maybe it's not too late.

我真正的父亲在君临掉了脑袋
My real father lost his head at King's Landing.

而我 已经做过了选择… 一个错误的选择
I made a choice...  and I chose wrong.

现在我把一切都搞砸了
And now I've burned everything down.

不是一切 大人
Not everything, my lord.

我带他回来了 他杀了其他人
I brought him back. He killed the others.

把他扔回属于他的地方去
Put him back where he belongs.

你得活下去 活下去复仇
You need to live to take revenge.

我才不管什么复仇了
I don't care about revenge.

不过是这么一点不如意 你就放弃了 不如… 不如意? 
A little misfortune and you're giving up.  mis misfortune?

那是我用剑的手 我就是那只手
My sword hand. I was that hand.

你终于尝到了… 真实世界的滋味 一旦被夺走了重要的事物 就哭天喊地 心灰意冷
You have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit.

你听起来像个娘们
You sound like a bloody woman.

我知道你为我做了什么
I know what you did for me.

你跟他们说塔斯全是蓝宝石
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

塔斯之所以被称为蓝宝石岛 是因为那里蔚蓝的海水
It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.

你找我? 
You wanted to speak to me?

我想确保 我们会尽全力让他回来
I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.

凯特琳·史塔克当初抓走提利昂… 我是怎么回应的? 
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner...  what did I do in response?

您发动了一场战争  既然我会 为了那个好色的小残废发动一场战争 为了我的长子和继承人 你说我会怎么做? 
You started a war. And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?

还不走啊 对
You're still here. Yes.

您有没有想过 也许我是最值得您信任的人 而不是您的儿子们? 
Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons?

不是詹姆也不是提利昂 是我
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

年复一年的教诲 有关家族和祖传家业 千篇一律 只有乏味而微小的改变 不知您是否意识到您的女儿 可能是唯一把教诲听进去的人? 
Years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them?

您把祖训看得比自己的孩子们要重要得多 而她也许最能帮助您去完成
That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?

好吧 来帮助我
All right. Contribute.

提利尔家族是个问题
The Tyrells are a problem.

提利尔家族帮我们打败了史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩

提利尔家族救了你的命 救了你孩子们的命
The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.

玛格丽将魔爪伸向了乔佛里
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

她懂得如何操控他
She knows how to manipulate him.

我真希望你也懂得如何操控他
I wish you knew how to manipulate him.

我不信任你 不是因为你是女人
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.

而是因为你自以为是
I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.

你让儿子骑在你头上 还任凭他欺压城里的所有人
You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.

也许......  您应该阻止他为所欲为
Perhaps...  you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.

您喜欢吗 奶奶? 
Do you like it, Nana?

又一朵金玫瑰 真没劲
Another golden rose. How original.

我吃饭的盘子里刻着玫瑰
I eat from plates stamped with roses.

我睡觉的被单上绣着玫瑰
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

我的夜壶上画着金玫瑰 难道这样就能好闻点
I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better.

亲爱的 玫瑰很无趣
Roses are boring, dear.

所有家族中最无趣的族语
Ha! The dullest words of any house.

这才让人过目不忘
Now that's memorable.

'强取胜于苦耕'多么强大
'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong.

这些才是你会防备的家族
Those are houses you watch out for.

冰原狼 海怪 凶猛的野兽
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

但生生不息的金玫瑰… 哈 真让人心惊胆战
But a golden rose growing strong ha, that strikes fear in the heart.

花园里来了只蜘蛛
A spider in the garden.

我想亲自欢迎您来到君临
I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing.

城市因您的到来而熠熠生辉
The city has been made brighter by your presence.

城市因我的到来而熠熠生辉? 
The city is made brighter by my presence?

这是你的常用台词吗 瓦里斯大人? 
Is that your usual line, Lord Varys?

你是来找我搭讪的吗? 
Are you here to seduce me?

也许是有点明显了
A little obvious, perhaps.

都这么久了 请继续吧
Seduce away. It's been so long.

但我觉得你这是白费力气
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

一个缺东西的和一个老太婆能发生什么? 
What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?

这个问题留给哲学家吧
A question for the philosophers.

可你绕了这么久的弯子 究竟为了什么而来? 
But you've come mincing all this way for something.

说吧 我听说你是个聪明人
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.

我很好奇你为什么来找我
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

您对珊莎·史塔克很有兴趣
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.

就因为我和她在这花园里聊过一次 你的探子就跑去报告了? 
Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you?

我为什么不能感兴趣? 
Why shouldn't I take an interest?

她是个引人注意的女孩 是吗? 
She's an interesting girl. Is she?

不 并没什么特别之处
No, not particularly.

不过她的童年倒是让人颇感兴趣
But she's had an interesting childhood.

请原谅 浪费了您的时间
Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.

我原以为我们都对她的幸福心怀关切
I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing.

你不能这么快就缴械投降了
You surrender rather easily.

我知道隔墙有耳 但很显然 灌木丛中也有
I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.

我挑选同盟很小心 挑选敌人则会更加小心
I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.

珊莎是同盟还是敌人? 
Which is Sansa Stark?

都不是 涉世未深的小孩
Neither. A babe in the woods.

我景仰她的父亲 的确
I admired her father. Yes.

奈德·史塔克有很多景仰者 又有多少人挺身而出 阻止刽子手砍去他的头颅? 
Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?

我帮不了史塔克大人
I could not help Lord Stark.

也许我能帮到他的女儿 怎么帮? 
Perhaps I can help his daughter. How?

您不是唯一对她感兴趣的人
You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.

这不奇怪
That's hardly surprising.

她是个美丽的姑娘 家族显赫
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

的确 如果有合适的求婚者 她会是个不错的妻子
Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.

我感觉您快说到关键点了
It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.

小指头不会在君临久留
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

我的一个心腹朋友告诉我 小指头走的时候 会带珊莎·史塔克一起走
A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.

为什么您要来告诉我这件事? 
And why have you come to me with this matter?

小指头生来没有封地 没有财产也没有军队
Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

现在他已经买到了头两样
He has acquired the first two.

还需要多久他就能拥有军队? 
How long before he has the army?

也许您会笑我 但我比大多数人都更了解他 这是事实
Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.

小指头是维斯特洛最危险的人之一
Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.

珊莎·史塔克就是北境的钥匙
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

如果小指头娶了她 就等于拿到了这把钥匙
And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.

这可真是让人羞愧
Which seems such a shame.

一个声誉如此之差的人怎么能 抢走这样一位美丽的新娘? 
Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?

你一定很瞧不起他
You must despise him.

才费了这么多口舌来贬低他
You're working so hard to undermine him.

实际上 我很欣赏他
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

可是 只要能当上哪怕一个灰烬之王 他甚至不惜坐视整个王国被付之一炬
But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.

你是个聪明人 瓦里斯大人
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.

我倒是有个可行的方案
I believe I have a possible solution.

用不着像你这么聪明也能想到
One doesn't need to be clever for that.

这都明摆着 不是吗? 
It's all rather obvious, isn't it?

我不是故意打扰你的
I didn't mean to disturb you.

不介意的话 请到城堡里等着
We'd like some privacy, please.

我们想私下里谈谈
If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.

或者告诉我你们的名字
Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names,

我会让国王亲自来跟你们说
I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.

你在祈祷什么? 
What did you pray for?

我不能告诉你 为什么? 
I can't tell you. Why not?

我来告诉你今早我在圣堂祈祷了什么
I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning.

我想想 我祈祷我的家族幸福安康 战争划上句点 冬天早日结束
Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.

恐怕很无聊 很老套
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.

你呢?  抱歉 我不能说
And you? I'm sorry, I just can't.

我的表姐阿莱娜 是我见过最美的女孩
My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

我 12 岁时 经常摔得青一块紫一块 阿莱娜就像是上天派来折磨我的女神
When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

她叫我猪脸
Pigface, she called me.

猪脸? 这真荒唐
Pigface? That's ridiculous.

我想是因为我的鼻子
I think it had something to do with my nose.

她只要在大厅里见到我 就会学猪叫
Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.

所以我祈祷她会染上可怕的皮肤病
So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.

一周后 她得了粥斑病
A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.

粥斑病?  你们北境没有吗? 
Porridge plague? You don't have it in the North?

皮肤开始时像煮开了的燕麦片 最后脸部脱落 在痛苦中死去
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you diein agony.

粥斑病 我是个白痴
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.

你不是的 别这么说
Don't say that. No, you're not.

阿莱娜后来怎样了? 
So what happened to Alanna?

她长大后成为最美丽的女子 嫁给了一位英俊的大人 有了心爱的孩子们 住在海边的城堡里
Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.

真让人沮丧
It's all terribly frustrating.

她现在一定很嫉妒你
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

你嫁到君临来 她会来看你 为你成为王后而假装高兴
You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.

我希望和你成为朋友 好朋友
I want us to be friends, good friends.

我会非常高兴的
That would make me very happy.

你一定要到高庭来
You must see Highgarden.

你会喜欢那儿的 我知道你一定会的
You'd love it there. I know you would.

我们会在丰收月晚上举行盛大的化妆舞会
We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.

你一定要来看看戏服
You should see the costumes.

人们制作了好几个月
People work on them for months.

我… 我不认为王后 会允许我离开君临
II don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.

你是指摄政太后吧
The Queen Regent, you mean.

等我嫁给乔佛里 我就会成为王后
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

然后 如果你嫁给洛拉斯…
And if you were to marry Loras...

你就会呆在高庭 不是吗? 
Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

我们就是姐妹了
We would be sisters, you and I.

杰奥·莫尔蒙
'熊老' 守夜人总司令

他是个好人 优秀的游骑兵
He was a good man, a good ranger.

他来自… 他是哪儿人?

恪尽职守
Never failed in his duty.

全力谨遵誓言
He kept his vows the best he could.

我们将难得再见如此之人
We shall never see his like again.

他的守望至死方休 于斯结束
And now his watch has ended.

他的守望至死方休 于斯结束
And now his watch has ended.

没想到区区脚伤也会要了他的命
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

脚伤可弄不死他
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

是卡斯特那杂种把他给活活饿死了
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

卡斯特得养自己的女儿
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

我们不能打个招呼 就把他的食物偷走
We can't just show up and steal all his food.

我们是守夜人 不是贼
We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.

卡斯特肯定会开一瓶好酒 摆上一桌火腿土豆筵席大吃一顿 然后嘲笑我们 在冰天雪地里挨饿受冻
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.

他是个该死的野人
He's a bloody wildling is all he is.

我没想到巴棱也能烤得这么香
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.

莫尔蒙 你有个儿子吧
You have one son, don't you, Mormont?

你还没见过哪个老子有 99 个儿子吧? 
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

我女儿多得数不过来
And more daughters than I can count.

我真为你高兴 呵呵 真的? 
I'm glad for you. Are you now?

我可希望你和你的崽子们早点滚蛋
Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.

等伤兵再恢复些我们就离开
As soon as our wounded are strong enough.

他们这样已经算不错了
They're as strong as they're gonna get.

那些只剩一口气的 怎么不直接给喉咙上开道口子了结算了? 
Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it?

如果你不想的话 可以留给我 我来帮你代劳
Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.

你要了结了谁啊 老头子? 
Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?

外边太冷了 一丁点吃的都没有
It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.

我老婆给过你们面包了
My wives gave you bread.

面包里满是木屑
There's sawdust in the bread.

如果你不喜欢 你可以出去找点雪吃
You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.

我只想吃你藏起来的好东西
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.

我说了 出去等着
I told you to wait outside.

他现在坐在这儿喝我们的酒 得等我们死了才会享用他屯的好东西
He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.

我已经给你们这些乌鸦够多了
I gave you crows enough.

我得喂饱我的女人们!
I've got to feed my women!

你这是承认自己把好东西都藏起来了?

是我打伤了乔佛里 米凯逃走了
I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.

那我应该杀了你
Then I should have killed you.

我没资格质疑王子
Not my place to question princes.

你被控谋杀
You stand accused of murder.

但此处没人知道指控的真假 所以我们无法裁定
But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.

Your father's forces prevailed.

詹姆爵士身体不舒服
Ser Jaime isn't well.

腐疮已经扩散了

恐怕得切掉
I fear it must be cut away.

最周全的办法是截掉整条手臂
The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.

学城剥夺了我的颈链
The Citadel stripped me of it.

他们觉得我的一些实验… 太大胆了
They found some of my experiments too bold.

我可以保住你的上臂 从肘部开始截
I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.

我不用右手就可以干掉你
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

我可以只移除腐肉 试着用沸酒处理掉 腐烂的部分 嗯

当然可以 殿下
Of course, Your Grace.

我有理由怀疑提利尔家族 并不真心为了王室谋益
I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.

哦 那您有没有将您的怀疑告知泰温大人? 
I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

我父亲是个脚踏实地的人 他偏爱事实
My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.

我反而认为事实是一种对真相的阻碍
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

如你所知 他很欣赏那些愿意助兰尼斯特一臂之力的人
And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.

对于肯帮助我们的人 我的父亲有多慷慨大方 对不肯帮助我们的人 他就有多冷酷无情
He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.

你和提利尔家关系不错
You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.

我想你也许愿意在离开君临前 调查一下他们
I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.

我会尽力的 谢谢
I shall do my best. Thank you.

希望你能比让你找回艾莉亚那次做得好一些

我向您保证
I assure you that it will.

'小恶魔' 财政大臣

神啊 孩子够了够了 我们又不在酒馆里

你叫我来有何贵干? 
To what do I owe this summons?

谢谢您的拜访 夫人
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

我有一些财政事务想与您商讨一二
I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.

我爬了这么多楼梯就是为了来讨论财政事务? 
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?

其实是王家婚礼的事
It's the royal wedding.

我听说您也参与筹备这件事
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

此事已经牵涉众多
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

他们说这场婚礼太奢侈了
The word extravagant has been used.

要是奢侈这个字眼都不能用来形容一场王家婚礼 要它何用? 
What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?

这点我理解 很好
I understand that. Good.

但是 作为财政大臣 我身负重任 要盘点王室支出
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown.

目前为止 这已是一笔巨额支出
As of now, it's a huge expense.

但是我们正处于战争中 奥莲娜夫人
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

哦 你不说我都快忘了
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

一百万斗小麦

大麦, 燕麦和黑麦各五十万斗
Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.

两万头牛

战时开支这方面我熟悉的很

您家族的贡献我们感激在心 为了维系王国它们必不可少
And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.

说到那场王家婚礼
As is a royal wedding.

民众渴求的不仅仅是食物
The people are hungry for more than just food.

他们渴望能转移注意力的东西
They crave distractions.

如果我们不给他们这种东西 他们会自己造一个
And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.

他们会很乐意通过把我们撕成碎片 来彻底转移注意力
And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.

来一场王家婚礼会安全得多
A royal wedding is much safer.

你说对吗?  对的
Wouldn't you say? I would.

根据传统 开支应由 皇室家族来承担
And traditionally paid for by the royal family.

我听说你是个酒鬼 为人粗鲁 一个彻头彻尾的浪荡子
I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.

你可以想象 当我看到你只是一个 战战兢兢的记账员时有多失望
You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

你去哪儿搞到的无花果 瓦兰提斯? 
Where did you go for them, Volantis?

夫人…  噢 好了好了
My ladyOh, very well.

我不会让别人说提利尔家族 袖手旁观的
I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.

我们会负责半数的开支 并且庆典也会如期举行
We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned.

这样够了吧?  完全足够 谢谢您
Is that sufficient? Quite sufficient. Thank you.

非常好 就这么定了 日安
Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

在修理贝里大人的盔甲
Just mending Lord Beric's armor.

我想留下来 为兄弟会当铁匠
I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.

你疯了吗? 
Have you lost your mind?

当兰尼斯特找到这里 你认为他们会放过铁匠? 
When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths?

他们会把你的脑袋塞进你自己打造的头盔里
They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.

我不加入兄弟会  兰尼斯特也早就想杀我了
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.

你没必要这样做
You don't have to do this.

罗柏也需要人才 我们明天走吧
Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow.

然后你就可以…  什么? 给他干活? 
And then youWhat? Serve him?

我一辈子都在给别人干活
I've served men my entire life.

我给君临的莫特师父干活 然后他把我卖给了守夜人
I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch.

我给赫伦堡的泰温大人干活 每天都提心吊胆会不会被拷打或者处死
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.

你刚才说你要为贝里大人干活
You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

他是他们的领袖 但也是他们选出来的
He may be their leader, but they chose him.

这些人情同手足 就像一家人一样
These men are brothers. They're a family.

我从来都没有过一个家
I've never had a family.

我可以做你的家人
I can be your family.

你不会是我的家人的

有人来救我们了?  兰尼斯特贱种! 抓住他!
Is this a rescue? Lannister filth! Take him!

求你了 我什么都没做 我只是个侍从

布林登・徒利
'黑鱼' 凯特琳・徒利之叔

你们五个身强力壮的汉子去谋害两个手无寸铁的侍从? 
It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?

这不是谋害 陛下
Not murder, Your Grace.

你的儿子不是这几个孩子杀的
Those boys didn't kill your sons.

我亲眼见到哈利昂战死沙场 托伦…

他们是他的亲族 他们只是孩子!
They were his kin. They were boys!

叫你母亲去看

她和我有同样的责任

打仗的时候 你得杀掉你的敌人

他打算轻描淡写地斥责我几句 然后加以原谅
He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.

他就是这样处理叛徒的
That's how he deals with treason.

我们的北境之王
Our King in the North.

我是不是该改口称您为 失去北境之王? 
Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?

押送卡史塔克大人去地牢

发发慈悲吧 大人! 我一个人也没杀

只是替他们看门
I only watched for the guards.

这个人只负责看门
This one was only the watcher.

最后一个吊死他 好让他看着其他人死去
Hang him last so he can watch the others die.

求你了! 求你了 不要 他们逼我这么做的!
Please! Please, no. They made me do it!

他们逼我的! 他们逼我的!
They made me! They made me!

这件事决不能传出奔流城
Word of this can't leave Riverrun.

他们是泰温・兰尼斯特的侄子
They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.

兰尼斯特有债必还
The Lannisters pay their debts.

他们都这么说
They never stop talking about it.

你要我既当杀人犯 又当骗子吗? 
Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?

我们无需说谎

把他们埋掉 一句也不提 直到战争结束
We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.

无论凶手出身多么高贵 如果我不能对凶手施以公正的裁决 那么我就不是为了正义而战
I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn.

卡史塔克家是北方人

为你与乔佛里王作对

血脉不能阻止你背叛我

He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.

我是个人质 你要拿我换赎金
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

事情不像你认为的这样
Don't think of it that way.

但事情就是这样 是的
But it is that way. It is.

但也不是 是的部分大于不是的
And it isn't. More is than isn't.

你知道 贝里很仰慕你的父亲
Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.

他想要把你送回去 不要赎金
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

为什么不呢?  我们需要金子
So why don't you? We need the gold.

我吓着你了吗 孩子? 
Do I frighten you, child?

你在生我的气
You're angry with me.

我不怪你
And I don't blame you.

但是放他走是对的
But letting him go was the right thing.

我有无数的理由想要吊死他
I have more reason than most to want him hanged.

我以为他杀了你 他是这么做了
I thought he killed you. He did.

索罗斯… 你把我救回来多少次了? 
Thoros...  how many times have you brought me back?

是光之王把你救回来的
It's the Lord of Light brings you back.

我只是个碰巧念了祷词的醉鬼
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

多少次?  五次吧 大概是
How many times? Five, I think.

第一次是… 魔山
There was the first timethe Mountain.

骑枪正中胸膛
Lance right through the chest.

然后是腹部被刺穿
Then I was stabbed in the belly.

然后是背上中箭
Then it was an arrow in the back.

还有侧面的斧伤
And that axe in the side.

后来兰尼斯特抓住了我 处以叛国罪
Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.

是被吊死的还是被匕首刺入眼睛? 
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

一起来的 那帮怂货不知道该选哪样
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

最后猎狗来了第六次
And the Hound makes six.

我被克里冈家的人杀死的第二次
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

你以为你得到教训了
You'd think you'd learn.

这不会越来越容易的 你知道
It's not getting any easier, you know.

每次我活过来
Every time I come back,

记忆和生命渐渐离我而去
Pieces of you get chipped away.

你能把没了头的人救回来吗? 
Could you bring back a man without a head?

不用六次 一次就行
Not six times. Just once.

我不认为那能管用 孩子
I don't think it works that way, child.

他是个好人 奈德・史塔克
He was a good man, Ned Stark.

他现在已在某处安息了
He's at rest now, somewhere.

我可不希望他像我一样
I would never wish my life upon him.

光之王 光耀我身
Lord, cast your light upon me.

护吾于暗
Protect me in the darkness.

因为长夜黑暗 处处险恶
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

我日夜祈祷你能来看我
I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.

我本想早点来
I meant to come sooner.

但战斗…  我知道您的麻烦 陛下
The battleI know of your troubles, my king.

梅丽珊卓夫人把所有事都告诉我了
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

您不能丧失信心 您信仰的是真神
You mustn't despair. Your claim is true.

您会凯旋的 我也曾经这么以为
You will be victorious. I believed that once.

你是唯一的神选中的人 也是我见过的最正直的人
You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.

我打破了神圣的誓言
I've broken a sacred vow.

不  我做了对不起你的事
No. I've wronged you.

我令你蒙羞  你不过是在执行神赐的使命
I have shamed you. You're doing god's work.

你不明白
You don't understand.

那红袍女… 是梅丽珊卓夫人…
The Red Woman the Lady Melisandre

梅丽珊卓夫人已经全都告诉我了
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

为服侍光之王而做的事 绝不会是罪恶的
No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.

我每日都在感谢着神 因为他将梅丽珊卓带给我们
I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us.

而我… 什么都没给  那不是真的
I gave you...  nothing. That's not true.

那你也是来看望她的? 
So you've come to see her as well?

你必须远离这些令你分神的事
You must keep away from such distractions.

你不需要请求我的允许
You don't need my permission.

从我上次见你到现在你已经长了不少
You've grown since I last saw you.

母亲说你在打仗
Mother said you fought in a battle.

洋葱骑士和你一起回来了吗? 
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

他还没来看望过我
He hasn't come to visit me.

他说他会从都城带礼物给我
He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.

他不会来看你了 孩子
He won't be visiting, child.

为什么? 他是我的朋友
Why not? He's my friend.

但别告诉母亲
But don't tell Mother I have it.

母亲不喜欢洋葱骑士
Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

戴佛斯爵士是个叛徒
Ser Davos is a traitor.

他因自己犯下的罪而被关在地牢里
He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.

别那么用力 你会把自己的皮蹭掉的
Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

你在这做什么? 
What are you doing here?

帮我把这身臭布脱掉
Help me out of these rags.

我就看中这个
This one suits me fine.

别怕 我对你没兴趣
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

若见我昏厥 赶快把我拖出去
If I faint, pull me out.

没有哪个兰尼斯特是洗澡时淹死的 我可不想当头名
I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.

我干吗管你死活? 
Why should I care how you die?

当然要管 你发下了神圣的誓言 忘了吗? 
You swore a solemn vow, remember?

你本应把我安然无恙的护送到君临
You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.

不怎么顺利 是吧? 
Not going so well, is it?

难怪你保不住蓝礼
No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.

你别这样 原谅我
That was unworthy. Forgive me.

你从头到尾细心保护 武艺也比旁人都强
You protected me better than most

你取笑我  我在道歉哪
Don't you mock me. I'm apologizing.

我吵累了
I'm sick of fighting.

停战的基础是信任
You need trust to have a truce.

瞧 又是这种眼神
There it is. There's the look.

我已经忍受了十七年 一张又一张不信任的脸
I've seen it for 17 years on face after face.

你听说过野火吗? 
You've heard of wildfire?

疯王对它着了魔
The Mad King was obsessed with it.

他喜欢看着人们被活活烧死 他喜欢看着他们的表皮被烧的焦黑然后爆裂 从他们的骨头上融化滴落
He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones.

他烧那些他讨厌的领主
He burned lords he didn't like.

他烧那些不遵从他命令的首相
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.

他烧所有敢于反对他的人
He burned anyone who was against him.

很快 半个国家都起来反抗他
Before long, half the country was against him.

伊里斯看谁都是叛徒
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.

他命火术士们将野火罐子 埋到全城各地 从贝勒大圣堂底 到跳蚤窝的陋屋
So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.

民居 马厩 与旅店甚至红堡的地窖内
Under houses, stables, taverns.

都有这些'水果'
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

最终 他自食苦果的一天到来了
Finally, the day of reckoning came.

劳勃・拜拉席恩在三叉戟河得胜之后 开始向都城进军
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident.

但我的父亲带着兰尼斯特大军 抢先一步抵达 承诺自己是为勤王而来
But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels.

但我更了解我的父亲
I knew my father better than that.

他绝不会站在失败者的一边
He's never been one to pick the losing side.

我告诉疯王这些
I told the Mad King as much.

我劝他老实投降
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

但国王不肯听我的
But the king didn't listen to me.

他也不听瓦里斯的警告
He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.

但他听从了国师派席尔的话 那个灰白 下垂的老贱货
But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt.

'你要相信兰尼斯特' 他说
'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said.

'兰尼斯特一直是 王家真正的朋友'
'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.'

于是城门大开 我父亲的军队洗劫了城市
So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city.

我再一次找到了国王 敦请他投降
Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender.

而他要我… 献上我父亲的人头…
He told me to...  bring him my father's head.

然后他… 找到了他的火术士
Then he...  turned to his pyromancer.

'烧光他们' 他说
'Burn them all,' he said.

告诉我 如果你的宝贝蓝礼 命令你杀死自己的父亲 还要把成千上万的男人 女人 和孩子活活烧死 你会这么做吗? 
Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it?

你会继续遵守你的誓言吗? 
Would you have kept your oath then?

我先杀了那火术士
First, I killed the pyromancer.

然后国王转身要逃跑
And then when the king turned to flee,

我从后面一剑把他捅了个透心凉
I drove my sword into his back.

'烧光他们' 他一直这样说着
'Burn them all,' he kept saying.

我认为其实他不是真的想死
I don't think he expected to die.

他… 他想要… 烧死我们所有人 然后重生 化为真龙 把他的敌人烧成灰烬
Hehe meant to...  burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.

于是我割了他的喉咙 以保证他不会得逞
I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.

这时奈德・史塔克看到了我
That's where Ned Stark found me.

如果这是真的 为何无人知晓? 
If this is true...  why didn't you tell anyone?

为什么你不告诉史塔克大人
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

你以为 高贵的临冬城公爵 会来听取我无力的解释? 
You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?

居然看着我 就认定我有罪
He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.

奔狼有什么资格 来评判雄狮? 
By what right does the wolf judge the lion?

有什么资格?   来人! 救命!
By what right? Help! Help!

公主殿下? 诸神啊 你在这里做什么? 
Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

嘘 你会吵醒伯特的  伯特? 
Shh, you'll wake Bert. Bert?

他是那个胖守卫 他负责今晚的值班
He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.

但他喜欢喝酒 总是一醉不醒
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

快回你的房间去 你不应该来这里
Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here.

如果你的父亲知道了…  他说你是个叛徒
If your father knewHe said you were a traitor.

我违抗了国王的旨意 你父亲的旨意 现在我为此付出了代价
I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.

我不在乎 你是我的朋友
I don't care. You're my friend.

你在这一定很无聊
You must get bored down here.

我给你带书来看
I brought you something to read.

是关于伊耿和他的巨龙的
It's about Aegon and his dragons.

伊耿以前住在这里 你知道吗? 
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?

坦格里安们建造了这座城堡  是啊
And the Targaryens built this castle. Aye.

他们建造了这座城堡  你可以把这本书藏在你的衣服下面
So they did. You can hide the book under your cloak.

这是本好书 我会带给你更多的
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

谢谢你 我的小姐 我肯定这是本好书 但给我是种浪费
Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.

拿着它 我还有更多书呢
Take it. I have more.

可是小姐 我不识字
My lady, I can't read the words.

我来教你吧 我会等伯特值班的时候回来教你
I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.

别这样  读书很简单 很有趣的
No. No. No. It's easy. It'll be fun.

走吧 我们不能  为什么不能
Go. We can't. Why not?

他们难道会把我们都关进牢房吗? 
What will they do, lock us in cells?

我不知道从哪开始
I wouldn't know where to start.

当你看到 A E 和 G 像这样在一起时 它听起来像伊戈
When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg.

而这本书的标题 是'征服者伊耿传 暨维斯特洛征服史'
And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'

那可真是场激烈的攻城战
It was a bitch of a siege.

嗯 你是第一个冲进派克城墙的缺口的? 
Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?

第二个 密尔的索罗斯第一个冲了进去
The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone,

乔拉・莫尔蒙 挥舞着他的火焰剑
'大熊' 熊老之子 waving that flaming sword of his.

密尔的索罗斯 那个不要命的疯子
Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.

劳勃在那场战役之后册封你为骑士的? 
Robert knighted you after the battle?

那是我生命中最值得骄傲的时刻
Proudest moment of my life.

单膝跪在地上 国王的剑则搭在我的肩上 我听他说道
One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words.

而我只想着要赶紧去撒泡尿
All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.

穿着全身的板甲整整 16 个小时
In full plate metal for 16 hours.

直到战斗结束之后才感到要撒尿
Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.

我几乎要成了第一个在被册封时在国王的靴子上撒尿的人
I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.

劳勃会为此哈哈大笑的
Robert would have laughed.

他是个好人 一个伟大的战士
He was a good man, a great warrior.

我花费如此多的时光在这个糟糕的国王的麾下战斗
I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.

你曾发下过誓言  是的
You swore an oath. Yes.

一个有荣誉的人会遵守他的诺言 即使他要服侍一个酒鬼 或是疯子
And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.

在我的生命中 这是第一次
Just once in my life before it's over,

我想知道带着骄傲去服侍 去为值得信任的人战斗 是什么样的感觉
I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in.

你信任她吗? 
Do you believe in her?

是的 卡丽熙 无垢者军官们
Yes, khaleesi. The officers.

所有的无垢者男童在被阉割时 都起了新的名字
All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut

灰虫子 红跳蚤 黑鼠
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

这些名字都是在提醒他们 自己的身份 害虫
Names that remind them what they are vermin.

劳勃国王要她的命
King Robert wanted her dead.

当然他想致她于死地
Of course he wanted her dead.

她是坦格利安家族的后人 是家族最后的血脉
She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

我猜御前议会里已经无人能够劝谏国王
I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.

我并没有列席御前议会 没有么? 
I didn't sit on the small council. No?

御林护卫的长官不是通常都要出席的么
Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally

照理来说 确实如此 但在劳勃起义的期间 我杀了他的许多朋友
Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

他才不需要听取疯王护卫的谏言 来帮他治国安邦呢
He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.

我倒是松了口气
Can't say I minded much.

我向来憎恶政治
I always hated the politics.

是啊 我又何尝不是呢
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

花那么多的时间去谋算如何背后放冷箭 或是背信弃义 嗯
Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over. Mmhmm.

但若是她若想一统七国 就必须从这些污秽的政争中杀出一条血路
Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

她会需要良臣名将的辅佐和谏言 真正的有识之士
She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.

说到这类人 你会想到谁呢? 
Which men do you have in mind?

乔拉爵士 我下面要说的话还望您见谅 但您的声誉在维斯特洛多年以来可以说是受尽诟病了
Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.

都是因为一个原因
It suffered for a reason.

我曾经贩卖过奴隶
I sold men into slavery.

我不确定如果您继续留在她的身边 能否对我们复辟故土的大业有任何助益
I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.

恕我直言 巴里斯坦爵士 但在您向劳勃国王点头哈腰的时候 我可是在忙着为卡莉熙抵御他派来的刺客哩
Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.

我俩都希望她能复国称帝啊 难道不是么? 
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

您可是仅仅加入我们阵营几日而已啊
You only joined us a few days ago.

我不敢妄言你的动机为何
I can't speak to your intentions.

但如果我们诚心要做女王殿下忠实的仆人 任何需要去做的事情 我们都要完成它 无论代价 不计荣辱
If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

在这里你也并不是什么御林铁卫队长了
You're not Lord Commander here.

你也只是另一个流亡者而已
You're just another exile.

而我只听从女王的号令
And I take my orders from the queen.

上床休息吧 你说对了
Come to bed. You were right.

卡史塔克弃我而去了
The Karstarks are gone.

带走我们将近一半的兵力
Almost half our forces.

泰温兰尼斯特知道如何逐步瓦解我们的势力
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.

攻打君临城?
Attack King's Landing?

那就正遂了他的心意
There's nothing he'd like better.

他一天之内即可粉碎我们
He'd crush us in a day.

把葛雷乔伊侵略的疆土夺回来
Take your land back from the Greyjoys.

等待冬天结束再卷土重来 冬季可能会持续五年之久啊
Wait out the winter. Winter could last five years.

一旦我的封臣回到家中 坐在火炉边 被家人陪伴着 温暖且安全 就没人再动南下之念了
Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.

当我将众臣集结一处时 我们曾有着共同的目标和任务
When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.

如今我们就像一群不停在争吵的小孩
Now we're like a band of bickering children.

那就给他们一个新目标
Give them a new purpose.

我甚至连临冬城在哪都不知道
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

而我们在这儿 那是君临城…
And we're here. King's Landing

我无法逼迫他们和我军兵戎相见 我也不能和敌军的精锐开战 但我可以攻其不备
I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.

凯岩城是不会插翅而飞的
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

我将会把他们的家园从他们的手中夺走
I'm going to take their home away from them.

我需要有人手来取代折回家乡的卡史塔克军队
I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.

放眼全境 只有一人 拥有这样的兵力 而且尚未与兰尼斯特家族结盟
There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.

我本应该称之为岳父的那个人
The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry

他真是个优秀的武士
He's such a splendid fighter.

你有什么好建议可以让我们…
Do you have any idea when we might...

待我和乔佛里成亲之日 我便着手开始谋划
I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

事情很快便会遂我们心愿
It should grow quickly.

乔佛里不会让我离开的
Joffrey won't let me leave.

他有一堆留下我的理由
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

而他又只需一个由头就会放你走
And only one to let you go.

因为这么做会取悦于我
Because it will please me.

又不是来真的. 我没见过你
That was no fight. I don't know you.

洛拉斯・提利尔
'百花骑士' 御林铁卫

在下奥利佛
Olyver, if it please you.

我觉得你应当和一个实力相当的伙伴较量 大人
I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

你要知道我就要成婚了 可我连什么时候被订婚都一无所知
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.

这种事总是私下决定的 在我看来
They rarely do, in my experience.

你的经验蛮丰富的啊 是吧? 
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

你上手挺快啊
That didn't take long.

额 也够久的了
Well, it took long enough.

看起来我们的百花骑士已经订了婚了
It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

那… 谁是那个幸运的女孩儿啊? 
And...  who's the lucky girl?

这也许不是世界上最宏伟 最快的船 但它属于我
She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine.

我一直想要一艘船
I've always wanted a ship.

好奇怪啊 不是么?  你是说? 
Strange, isn't it? What is?

有时一旦我们得到拥有了 我们曾经的所想就变得那么无足轻重 那时的我们又渴望新的事物
It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.

你的发型很与众不同呢
Your hair is different.

玛格丽小姐就是这样的发型
Lady Margaery wears it that way.

很多小姐都这么弄
Many ladies wear it this way.

不久我就会离开这座城市了
I'll be leaving the city soon.

你仍然想要我和你一起去? 
You still want me to come with you?

这并不在于我想如何
It's not a question of what I want.

你想回家 不是么? 
You want to go home, don't you?

那是当然 比一切都想
Of course. More than anything.

但也许更应该等待
But maybe it would be better to wait.

我在想着这将会变得多么的危险
I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.

不是说我 而是对你
Not just for me, but for you.

若有不幸的事发生在你身上 我会很伤心
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.

听你这么挂念我的安危 我真的无法形容我有多感动
I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.

希望你把我当做你的朋友 珊莎
I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.

如果你想留下来 你就一定能留下来
If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.

我回来时我们再多谈谈
We'll speak again when I return.

她在这做什么? 
What's she doing here?

我们要谈的的事与她有关
Our business concerns her, too.

你会很高兴的得知 在和奥莲娜提利尔会谈之后
You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,

这一场通婚 我为皇室省去了成千上万的开销
I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

我们还有要事要商量
We have something important to discuss.

我乃财政大臣 节省开支是重中之重
I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.

你看得我很不舒服
You're making me uncomfortable.

你姐姐得到情报你的新朋友提利尔家族 正谋划将珊莎史塔克嫁给洛拉斯爵士
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

虽然不见得真的对洛拉斯的胃口 但我相信他们能和得来
Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

你的笑话很无聊  这不是我最好的发挥啦 但是…
Your jokes are not appreciated. It wasn't my best, but

我把这些人带入皇室 他们就这么报答我 想从我手中窃取通往北境的钥匙
I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.

珊莎是通往北境的钥匙? 
Sansa is the key to the North?

我好像记得她还有个大哥嘛
I seem to remember she has an older brother.

卡史塔克家族已经返回故乡了
The Karstarks have marched home.

狼崽丧失了近乎一半的军力  他已经气数将尽
The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered.

葛雷乔依把他的两个小弟都杀了
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

这样一来 珊莎史塔克就成了临冬城的继承人
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.

但我可无意任由她和提利尔家族联姻
And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.

正是提利尔家族的相助 我们才赢得了战争
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.

你这样拒绝他们明智么
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

倒不是说拒绝 这里面有一个计策
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

计策可不是人人都知道的呢
Plots are not public knowledge.

在小乔大婚之前 提利尔家族这个心思不会得逞的
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding.

我们必须先下手为强 把这个联盟扼杀在摇篮中
We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.

是吧 咱们怎么去做呢? 
And how do we do that?

我们给珊莎史塔克指定另一门婚配
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

好主意  是好主意
Wonderful. Yes, it is.

小乔杀了这孩子的父亲 让她的日子过的也生不如死
Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head.

现在她好不容易挣脱小乔的魔掌 你把她交给我? 
Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me?

即便是你 这么做也太过残忍
That's cruel even for you.

你想要虐待她么? 
Do you intend on mistreating her?

她幸不幸福 与我何干 又与你何干 她还只是个孩子!
The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours. She's a child!

她已经来过潮了 我向你保证 我们曾就此详细的讨论过
She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.

就这么定了 你要娶她 睡了她 而且要让她怀上你的种
There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.

当然这些都是你能做到的  如果我拒绝呢? 
Surely you're capable of that. And if I refuse?

你不是一直想因为你在战争的战绩而受到赏赐么
You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle.

珊莎史塔克这样的赏赐 你做梦也不敢去梦吧
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.

而且你也到了该成婚的时候了
And it is past time you were wed.

你忘了么? 
Or don't you remember?

你还是感谢天感谢地去吧

他不像你这么对我好
He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.

直到魔山将长枪刺入他的心脏

What does that have to do with anything?

你们在干什么? 放开他

让他们住手  过来

你身体的哪个部分是你最不需要的?

求求你  '求求你'不是身体的一部分

我什么都告诉你 求你了

但你已经全都告诉我了

你老爸对你很苛刻
Your daddy was mean to you.

史塔克家族不接纳你

有点倒还不错
One good bit, though.

史塔克家的孩子 还活着
The Stark boys, they're still alive.

会不会是一次难忘的狩猎? 
Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?

你失败了 但我是一个更优秀的猎手
You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.

现在 小拇指怎么样? 
Now...  how about your little finger?

你不怎么用它 对吧? 
You don't use that for much, do you?

对? 好的 我们就从这儿开始
No? Good. Let's start with that.

你肯定在想你为什么在这里
You've been wondering why you're here.

我为什么要这样对你
Why I'm doing this to you.

我以新旧诸神之名起誓
By the old gods and the new, I swear it.

如果你能弄清楚我是谁 我为什么折磨你 游戏就算你赢 而如果你求我砍掉你的指头 就算我赢
You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.

如果我赢了 你会放我走吗? 
If I win, you'll let me go?

如果你认为这会有一个美好结局 你刚才一定听得不够仔细
If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.

再说一遍'求求你' 包你后悔的
You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't.

北境  太模糊了
The North. Too vague.

我他妈的看起来像一个安柏家族的人吗? 
Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?

你怎么知道的? 
How did you know that?

我们进来的时候你看见旗帜了? 
Did you see any banners flying when we came in?

很好 席恩大人
Very good, Lord Theon.

被弑君者勒死了
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

你父亲是瑞卡德・卡史塔克伯爵
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

你发誓会告诉我如果我…  你猜对了
You swore to tell me if IYou're right.

瑞卡德・卡史塔克伯爵是罗柏・史塔克的封臣
Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman.

这就是你为什么折磨我
That's why you're torturing me.

当然 你忘了问一个问题
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.

你忘了问我是不是个骗子
You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

我告诉你的每一个字都是谎言
Everything I told you is a lie.

发生在你身上的这些不需要什么理由
This isn't happening to you for a reason.

好吧 有一个理由…  我乐在其中
Well, one reasonI enjoy it.

求你了 砍掉它! 砍掉它! 砍掉它!
Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

感谢你这么快就赶来了
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

我明白这年头行路可不再轻松愉快
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

路上到处是土匪和强盗
The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.

然而北境之王召唤的时候 我们来了
But when the King of the North summons us, we come.

父亲让我们告诉您 他将继续维持盟约 如果您能满足他的条件的话
Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met.

Lord Frey requires a formal apology

布林登・徒利 为您打破神圣誓言 没能娶他的一位女儿而道歉
'黑鱼' 凯特琳・徒利之叔 for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.

当然 这是他应得的 是我的错
Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.

作为对这种背叛的赔偿 他要求赫伦堡和其领地
As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.

我不认为这 我们在为北境战斗
I don't think that'sWe are fighting for the North.

赫伦堡可不在北境
Harrenhal is not in the North.

战争结束的时候就是了 它在战略上也不再有用了
It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.

当然还有别的要求
And there's something else.

我们会尽所能供其所需
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

我们父亲要求艾德慕大人迎娶 他的一位女儿…  萝丝琳
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughtersRoslin.

我能先见她吗?

我们明早出发前往孪河城
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

在我们离开之前要得到一个答复 而婚礼将在半个月内举行 不然盟约就此解除
We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.

你父亲真的明白我们还在打仗吗? 
Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?

见证女儿嫁给一个好丈夫 能让他安心
It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.

并且最近的经历让他对于 拖得太久的婚约没有信心
And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.

可以理解
He has every right to be.

请允许我们商议一下
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

为什么我要让那个老黄鼠狼为我挑新娘? 
Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?

至少我该和你有同样的选择权
At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.

他是个骄傲的老头 然而我们伤害了他
He's a proud man and we've wounded him.

听我说 听好了 你…
Listen to me and listen very carefully. You

神谕和律法说得都很清楚
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

没人能够强迫谁去结婚
No man can compel another man to marry.

我的拳头倒是可以强迫你的牙齿离开嘴巴
The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.

好了好了 你听见他说了
It's all right. You heard him.

如果你拒绝 我们和佛雷家的盟约就完蛋了
If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.

从我 12 岁开始他就想要把他的女儿塞给我了
He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12.

他到现在还没死心
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

如果我说不 他还会回来的 那时他就会让我挑一个女儿
When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

你这是要赌上我们的自由 和性命去换一个漂亮点的老婆? 
You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

我有仗要去打

没有他们我们赢不了
We can't win it without them.

没时间讨价还价了
I have no time to haggle.

你说过你想弥补石磨坊的过失
You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.

You recall that heroic engagement?

我说要补偿的时候没想到结婚这种事
I had something less permanent in mind.

我每战必胜 却赢不了这场战争

如果我们现在不这么做的话 就彻底输了
If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.

You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

我奉史塔克夫人之命 把詹姆・兰尼斯特押送回君临

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

罗柏国王离开赫伦堡的时候 他的母亲是他的囚犯
When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.

如果她不是他母亲的话 他会以叛国罪绞死她
If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.

布蕾妮・塔斯
'美人' 凯特琳的护卫

我必须把你们交还给罗柏・史塔克
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

不过 你还是坐在这里 看着我吃不了饭的样子
But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner.

很多人会为你出个好价钱
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

我们都知道谁会出最高价
We both know who would pay the most.

或者让你付出最多的代价 如果让他发现你抓住我 并且送我回北境去服刑
Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.

也许最保险的做法是杀了你们俩然后烧了尸体
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

也许是个不错的方法 如果你真的以为我父亲不会知道真相
It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.

罗柏国王让你的父亲忙着呢
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.

他没空管别的
He doesn't have time for anything else.

他会为你腾出时间来的
He'll make time for you.

一旦你能够上路了
As soon as you're well enough to travel,

我会让你去君临的 这算是为我的部下所为的补偿
I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.

你得发誓告诉你父亲真相 并不是我搞残你的
And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

喝一杯?  我就算了
Shall we drink on it? I don't partake.

你明白对于普通人来说这有多可疑? 
You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

小姐 祝我们的旅途不再节外生枝
My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.

哦 她不会和你一起走的
Oh, she won't be going with you.

我负责带詹姆爵士到…
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to

你受指控参与叛国
You are charged with abetting treason.

恐怕我得坚持
I'm afraid I must insist.

你没权力坚持任何事情
You're in no place to insist on anything.

我期望你从不自量力上 学到点什么
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.

我孙子是高庭的骄傲
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

七大王国最炙手可热的未婚男子
The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.

您的女儿…  很富有 并且是七大王国最美丽的女人 还是国王的母亲
Your daughterIs rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms...  and the mother of the king.

我算得上是这方面的专家了
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

衰老很快就会体现在她的身上
Her change will be upon her before long.

我懒得跟你解释还会发生什么变化
I'll spare you the details of what will happen then.

你们男人可能对嗜血杀戮挺有兴趣 但这方面就是另一回事了
You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.

岁月也在惩罚我们 我向你保证
The years punish us as well, I promise you that.

我的胃口倒还挺不错的
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

唯一会让我倒胃口的 是你孙子那些臭名昭著的行为
The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities.

你否认吗?  哦 完全没有
Do you deny them? Oh, not at all.

彻头彻尾的玩火
A sword swallower through and through.

有这样丑闻的男孩 有机会娶到七国最美的女人 还能抹去身上的污点 应该心怀感激
And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.

您有没有和表兄弟一同长大 泰温大人?
Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

您父亲封臣的儿子 侍从 或者马房小弟?
Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?

我真心称赞你的自制
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

不过两个男孩在床上 '打打闹闹'再正常不过了
But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.

也许'高'庭对于不正常的行为 也有比较高的容忍度
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.

当然 我们不会为这点基情 就自寻烦恼 不过 弟弟和姐姐 在我的家乡 可算是 难以抹消的污点
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but...  brothers and sisters where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.

我不想再讨论 更多这种恶意的谎言
I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.

无论是不是谎言 你必须承认很多人都觉得它挺可信的
Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing.

可信到他们能披甲上阵 去杀些兰尼斯特 和提利尔 都是因为我们的新联盟
Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.

我不管人们相信什么
I don't care what people believe.

我代表自己 否认这点
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

现在 如果关于我孩子的谣言是真的 那么乔佛里根本就不是国王 提利尔家也就把他们的宝贝玫瑰插在了牛粪上
Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.

如果瑟曦太老 给不了洛拉斯孩子 我们就又把另一朵鲜花插在了牛粪上
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.

我们不能冒这个险
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

不确定性让你很不舒服
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.

那我们就来'确定'一下
I'll remove it for you.

如果你拒绝洛拉斯和瑟曦的婚姻
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,

我会让他披上白袍
I will name him to the Kingsguard.

我相信你很熟悉御林铁卫的誓言
I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows.

不生子 哦…
He will never have children. Oh...

提利尔家族会逐渐消亡
The Tyrell name will fade.

而高庭会传给 乔佛里和玛格丽的孩子
And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.

难道你会愿意让一个痛恨你的人 保护你的外孙? 
You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?

我会让一个谨守誓言 武艺精湛的战士保护我的外孙
I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously.

那么 要我起草这条命令呢? 
So, shall I draw up the order?

还是你同意这桩婚事? 
Or do you consent to this marriage?

一个人能做到名副其实 不辱荣誉 真的是极其罕见的
It's a rare enough thing a man who lives up to his reputation.

我们必须割断绳索!
We've gotta cut them loose!

别针好漂亮
That's a wonderful pin.

嗯 其实这应该是一个胸针
Oh, it's more of a brooch, really.

不过我想胸针应该也是一种别针 所以…
Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so...

我很高兴听说我们的…
I'm very happy about...

感觉好像在做梦一样
I feel like I'm in a dream.

对 我也是 绝对是
Yes, me, too. Definitely.

很小的时候我就幻想过一场盛大的婚礼
I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young.

幻想着宾客们 盛宴 比武大会
The guests, the food, the tournaments.

当然还有新娘
And the bride, of course.

世上最美丽的新娘 身着美丽的金丝礼服 和流苏袖口的绿色织锦
The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.

你去过高庭吗 小姐? 
Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

没有 来君临之前 我从来没有离开过临冬城
No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing.

不过听说那里很美
But it sounds wonderful.

我等不及想去看看
I can't wait to see it.

还有离开这里
And to leave this place.

这里很可怕 是吧? 
It's terrible, isn't it?

世界上最可怕的地方
The most terrible place there is.

对这桩婚事我们恐怕无能为力
I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.

我们可以把他们两个都杀了
We can have them both killed.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 财政大臣

很难说在这场协议婚姻中 我们四个谁最悲惨
It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.

虽然洛拉斯肯定也会陷入 深深地痛苦之中
Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.

父亲倒是一视同仁
Father doesn't discriminate.

我们全都被送进了地狱
We're all being shipped off to hell together.

提利尔家族暗地谋划要削弱我们家族
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.

我所做的都是为了保护家族
I did what I did to protect our family.

而且是为了家族的生存 做了积极贡献的一分子
A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival.

不管你和父亲或者任何人 是不是承认这一点
Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.

如果不是你的野火把戏
If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,

史坦尼斯就会在父亲来到之前攻陷君临
Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.

我们的头大概现在还在城门上烂着呢
Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.

那么叫人杀我真是个奇怪的感谢方式
Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.

在君临仅有两人 有权指挥御林铁卫
There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

是不是你命令曼登爵士 在黑水河之战中趁乱杀死我?
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

我理解他想杀我的冲动
The impulse I understand.

他恨我因为我是唯一一个告诉他 他实际上是个什么货色的人
He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is.

所以 他想我死 很正常
So, fair enough. He wants me dead.

他本来可以将我毒死 没有人会发现
He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.

但是国王命令御林铁卫 在他自己的军队面前 杀死国王之手
But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army.

你想让我说什么? 
What do you want me to say?

我想让你告诉我 我的生命是不是还处在危险中
I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.

但危险不会来自乔佛里
But not from Joffrey.

父亲在这里他不会做任何事
He won't do anything now Father's here.

七大王国在对泰温・兰尼斯特的恐惧之下 实现统一
Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.

不久之后他们就不必再害怕他
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

乔佛里会被玛格丽征服 那个眼神如雌鹿般温柔的婊子
Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doeeyed whore.

之后他的子孙也会如此
And so will his children and their children.

历史将从我们手中被夺走
History will be taken from our hands.

你至少还能逃
You may escape, at least.

只要詹姆回来
Once Jaime gets back,

洛拉斯爵士恐怕会被 一剑穿肠的
Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.

如果詹姆回来的话 是的
When Jaime gets back, yes.

但是你觉得他什么时候才会回来? 
But when do we think that's going to be?

我们都不知道他在哪
He's out there somewhere.

詹姆回不回来 我都他妈的完蛋了
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

谁去告诉她呢?
Who's going to tell her?

你觉得人们会喜欢吗?
Do you think people will like it?

我觉得根本不会有人注意
I don't think they will even notice it.

你说得对 又不是我的婚礼
You're right. It's not my wedding.

总之 看得出来 高庭的裁缝比君临的 手艺要好得多
Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing.

我的婚礼上肯定不会用这么呆板的东西
They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.

洛拉斯喜欢绿色和金色的锦缎
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

他们会同意我邀请我的家人吗? 
Will they let me invite my family?

他们可没问我的意见
They haven't asked my opinion.

但你觉得会不会呢? 
But do you think they will?

珊莎小姐 提利昂大人想见您
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.

我要不要…   不好意思 小姐
Should II beg your pardon, my lady.

下午好 提利昂大人
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.

我正在试穿乔佛里国王婚礼上要穿的礼服
I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.

恩 那会是场盛大的婚礼
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

我有话要跟你说 珊莎小姐
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

你为什么要跟她单独说? 
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

请原谅她 提利昂大人
Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.

但是我信任她 虽然她告诉我别相信她
But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.

有时我们总是急着听到消息 但往往在知道之后 才明白还不如 在一个完全不同的情境下听到它
Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.

没关系 真的
It's all right, really.

这这 这这事很尴尬
It'sthis thisthis is awkward.

1000 柄剑 来自伊耿的手下败将
1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies,

'小指头' 赫伦堡公爵

瓦里斯 在'黑死神'贝勒里恩的龙焰下锻造而成

没有 1000 柄
There aren't 1,000 blades.

甚至没有 200 柄
There aren't even 200.

哈 我相信你数过
Ha, I'm sure you have.

却有着独特的吸引力
Yet it has a certain appeal.

真可惜诸多选择中
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

你不得不向莱莎・艾林这个第二选择妥协了
Shame you had to settle for your second choice.

言之尚早 我的朋友
Early days, my friend.

我很荣幸 真的… 你看起来如此害怕 看到我将要得到我想要的
It is flattering, really...  you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.

打败你从来都不是我的首要目标
Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition,

不过谁不想看到自己的朋友不时受挫呢? 
Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?

比如 当我破坏了你 把珊莎・史塔克交给提利尔家的计划时
For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

如果让我说实话
If I'm going to be honest,

我确实明显地感觉到 一种愉悦之情
I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there.

不过你的心腹 一直在向你报告我的计划的 你想要保护的那个 你没有给她带来任何好处
But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect...  you didn't bring her any enjoyment.

她也没有给我带来什么好处
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

她是我的失败投资
She was a bad investment on my part.

幸运的是 我有个朋友 想要玩点新花样
Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new.

他很感谢我为他提供 新鲜的体验
And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.

我为了王国做了我该做的事情
I did what I did for the good of the realm.

你知道王国本来是什么吗? 
Do you know what the realm is?

只不过是一把数千柄伊耿敌人的剑融成的王座
It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies.

只不过是一个反反复复讲给别人的故事 直到我们自己都忘了这是个谎言
A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.

但是除去谎言之外我们还剩什么呢? 
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?

一个慢慢吞噬我们所有人的深渊
A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

试图攀爬的人大多失败了 之后再也不敢尝试
Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.

失败摧毁了他们
The fall breaks them.

还有的人本来有机会攀爬 但他们拒绝了
And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.

他们紧紧依附于王国 或诸神 甚或爱
They cling to the realm or the gods or love.

只有那阶梯才是真实的
Only the ladder is real.

努力攀爬才是一切
The climb is all there is.

估计一星期吧
About a week, I think.

耶哥蕊特
'火吻而生' 野人

估计? 你连这都不知道? 
You think? You don't know?

我们去黑城堡 都是走国王大道
When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.

你们就是那样打仗的? 
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

敲鼓 挥旗 开道前进? 
You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?

大多时候的确如此
Most of the time, yes.

在战场上 拿旗子的人怎么打呢? 
How do the men holding the banners fight?

高举自家纹章已是莫大荣誉
It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

那鼓手呢… 那也是一份莫大的荣誉喽? 
And the drummersis that a great honor, too?

鼓手一般只是小男孩
Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.

他们有什么用? 
So what good are they?

可以提振士气  怎么会? 
They help the men march. How?

呃 是因为… 因为节奏
Well, it'sit's the rhythm.

哦 你是指右 左 右 左 右? 
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot?

你们连这都要人提醒? 
You need help remembering that?

等曼斯发出袭击黑城堡的信号时 我们才不会敲着鼓 好让他们知道我们来了
When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.

你们会点燃北境前所未见的大火 好让他们知道你们来了
No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.

你什么都不懂 琼恩? 雪诺
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

她说得对 你什么都不懂
She's right, you don't.

我懂这个… 你在长城上割了我的绳子
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

欧瑞尔
'鹰眼' 易形者

你看她耿耿于怀了吗? 
Do you see her sulking about it?

她懂得这是我们的行事方式
That's because she understands the way things are.

你打算跟我分享? 
And are you gonna share it with me?

分享你在鸟脑袋里领悟的大智慧? 
The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?

自由民渴望合作就合作
People work together when it suits them.

值得忠诚就忠诚
They're loyal when it suits them.

乐意相爱就相爱
They love each other when it suits them.

情愿你死我活就你死我活
And they kill each other when it suits them.

她懂这个 你不懂
She knows that, you don't.

所以你永远得不到她
Which is why you'll never hold onto her.

这雨会再耽误一天行程
That rain will cost us another day.

佛雷会等的 他知道我们上路了
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

瓦德大人生性挑剔
Lord Walder is prickly by nature.

挑剔? 你说他挑剔? 
Prickly? That what you call it?

布林登・徒利
'黑鱼' 凯特琳・徒利之叔

他大概是我见过的最可恶的人
Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.

是的, 所以我们才…    相比瓦德? 佛雷
Yes, and that is whyI've seen wet shits

我宁愿面对这操蛋的雨天
I liked better than Walder Frey.

抱歉 陛下
Apologies, Your Grace.

我是个老粗 平时都跟士兵打交道
Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.

我过去两年都在护理伤员 眼睁睁看着他们流血而死
I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die.

我不怕什么操蛋的雨天
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

佛雷大人会把这次延误当做蓄意轻慢
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

随他说
He can take it as he likes.

反正他图谋的婚礼已经得逞

他怎么跟你说的? 让你作他的夫人 和你一起住在城堡里?

你喜欢他漂亮的头发和眼睛?

你以为漂亮就能让你快乐?  别碰我
You think pretty is gonna make you happy? Don't touch me.

等你看清他的真面目 就不会这么爱他了

我在临冬城长大 却一心只想逃离 来京城 来君临
Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital.

来看南方的骑士和他们漂亮的铠甲 来体验夜晚… 无数窗户里摇曳的无数蜡烛
See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark all the candles burning in all those windows.

我是个蠢蛋丫头 做着愚蠢的梦 不知吸取教训
A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.

记得第一次在王座厅见到你时
I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.

我从未见过比你更不快乐的人

我由衷地希望你能快乐 珊莎 我祖母也这么想

但像我们这样的女人 必须要利用身边的一切资源
But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.

我怎么利用呢? 
How do I make the best of my circumstances?

提利昂大人虐待过你?  从未
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you? No.

他待你好吗? 
Has he been kind to you?

但你不想要他

但远非最糟糕的兰尼斯特 你同意吗?

在这儿跟你抱怨…

大部分女人必须试过才知道
Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it.

但可悲的是 太多女人在容颜老去以前 尝试得太少了
And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray.

提利昂可能会给你惊喜
Tyrion may surprise you.

据我所知 他是花丛老手

这算是好事吗?

还是个大美人儿

我觉得没问题

雪伊不会高兴
Shae isn't going to like it.

你要娶她吗? 嗯? 
Are you gonna marry her? Eh?

你上次娶个婊子落得什么下场? 
How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?

我真不该告诉你
I should never have told you about that.

你想要雪伊 留下就是 跟一个人结婚 和另一个人睡
You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other.

你只需在史塔克女孩肚里留个种
All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.

你的种将来会成为临冬城公爵
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.

你可以凭他之名统治北境
You can rule the North in his name.

你完全可以拥有两个女人和一整个王国
You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.

两个鄙视我的女人 和一个跟着她们鄙视我的王国
Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.

浪费时间赢得爱戴 最后你会成为最受爱戴的死人
You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.

你想干那个史塔克女孩
You want to fuck that Stark girl.

只是不愿承认罢了
You just don't want to admit it.

我雇你不是让你来倾倒你那一肚子坏水
I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.

我自己的坏点子够多了
The ones already there don't need company.

你雇我是让我去杀那些烦你的人
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

我这肚子坏水是免费附赠
Evil notions come free.

你想跟我谈? 
You wanted to speak to me?

我想听取御前会议的汇报
I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.

我们随时欢迎您 出席您的御前会议 陛下
You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace.

有很多重要事务需要国王处理
Many important matters require a king's attention.

你在首相塔主持御前会议 而非在议事厅
You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.

我在首相塔工作
The Tower of the Hand is where I work.

从那儿走过来要花不少时间 这些时间我可以更好地利用
To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.

所以如果我想出席御前会议
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

就必须爬上首相塔的所有台阶? 
I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

我可以叫人抬您去
We could arrange to have you carried.

跟我说说那个东方的坦格利安女孩 还有她的龙
Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.

你从哪儿听说的? 
Where did you hear about this?

你难道不认为我们应当做点什么吗? 
Don't you think we ought to do something about it?

当我担任国王之手 辅佐你父亲的前任时 坦格利安家所有巨龙的头骨 都悬挂在这个房间里
When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.

最后出生的那一只 就放在这儿
The skull of the last of them was right here.

只有苹果那么大
It was the size of an apple.

而最大的那个像辆四轮马车
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

是的 拥有那颗头的怪物 三百年前就死了
Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.

来自世界彼端的奇谈逸闻 不是什么威胁
Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.

我们怎么知道那些龙只是奇谈逸闻 而非翻云覆雨的猛兽? 
But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?

因为在国王一无所知的问题上 辅佐国王治国 的专业人士这么说
Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.

没人辅佐我治国啊
But I haven't been counseled.

现在正有人在辅佐你
You are being counseled at this very moment.

这些事应该先咨询我的意见
I should be consulted about such things.

从现在开始 我会确保 一切重要事务 都适当地征询您的意见 如果必要的话
From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary.

渊凯人以训练床奴闻名 而非士兵
The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.

正面交锋当然轻而易举
On the field, with ease.

But they won't meet us on the field.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 熊老之子

他们不缺补给 不缺时间 还有坚固的城墙
They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.

聪明的话 他们会躲在高墙后面 逐步消耗我们
If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.

渡过狭海前 我可不想损失半数军队
I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

我们不需要渊凯 卡丽熙
We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

攻下这座城市不会令您与维斯特洛或是铁王座 接近半步
Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.

渊凯城里有多少奴隶? 
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

至少二十万
200,000, if not more.

那我们就有二十万个理由去夺取这座城市
Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.

高贵的拉兹达尔・莫・厄拉兹 古老而荣耀的厄拉兹家族成员 文明人的主人和野蛮人的对话者 前来商谈和平条件

我们的帝国源远流长 早在古瓦雷利亚的龙搅乱世界之前
Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria.

无数军队被我们的城墙粉碎
Many an army has broken against our walls.

征服这里是妄想 卡丽熙
You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.

很好 我的无垢者正需要实战经验
Good. My Unsullied need practice.

据说要尽早让他们见血
I was told to blood them early.

若您要的是鲜血 那就让它流淌
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.

没错 您在阿斯塔波干下野蛮的行径
'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor.

但我们渊凯人宽大仁慈
But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.

这就是他告诉你的? 
Is that what he's telling you?

凡事皆有原因? 
That it's all for a reason?

天将降大任于你, 才要折磨你? 
All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you?

我也希望是这样 小主人
I wish it were true, little lord.

但老天连一泡乌鸦屎也不会给你, 给我, 给任何人
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.

你不懂 你根本不懂

我不知从哪摸出一把刀
I don't know how I got the knife.

抓在手里 深深地扎进 他的心脏
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.

可他似乎根本没感觉
And he hardly seemed to notice.

我把他和我们的小屋一起烧了 才得脱身
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

我没问老天这有什么含义
I didn't ask the gods what it meant.

不需要问 我知道了
I didn't need to. I already knew.

长城以北不是人待的地方了

The whole countryside is yapping about it.

你舅舅要娶佛雷家的小姐
Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.

你要是不惦记着砸我的脑袋 没准儿咱们还能赶上婚礼
So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 熊老之子

为了金钱战斗的人没有任何荣誉或忠诚可言
Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty.

不值得信任
They cannot be trusted.

他们为了钱会杀任何人
They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid.

渊凯人钱给得很足
The Yunkish are paying them well.

我认得他们旗帜上的断剑
Only by the broken swords on their banners.

他们是次子团
They're called the Second Sons.

领头的是布拉佛斯人梅罗
A company led by a Braavosi named Mero,

那他到底是泰坦还是私生子? 
Is he more titan or bastard?

他很危险 卡丽熙
He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

不可小觑? 
Enough to make a difference?

跟尸体要账可不容易
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

佣兵们大概也更喜欢站在胜者一边吧
I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.

您说得对
I imagine you're right.

我想跟泰坦私生子谈谈谁是胜者的问题
I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

他不会来的
He may not agree to meet.

为了金钱搏命的人 不会甘心向小姑娘认输
A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

陛下 请允许我向您引见 次子团的团长…
Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons

普兰达・纳・纪森 以及…
Prendahl na Ghezn, and...

梅罗
'泰坦的私生子' 次子团团长

你就是龙之母? 
You are the Mother of Dragons?

我肯定在里斯的妓院里操过你
I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.

管住你的舌头 为什么? 
Mind your tongue. Why?

舔过我屁眼呢 那功夫真是与生俱来
She licked my ass like she was born to do it.

你 小女奴 拿酒来
You, slave girl, bring wine.

这儿没有奴隶
We have no slaves here.

等仗打完了你们全得做奴隶 除非我发话
You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you.

脱衣服 坐我大腿上 你取悦了我 我也许就把次子团带过来
Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.

你把次子团带过来 我也许不会阉你
Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.

巴利斯坦爵士 次子团有多少兵力? 
Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?

不到两千 陛下
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

我们的人要比这多吧? 
We have more, don't we?

我只是个年轻女子 不懂战争之道 或许像您一样久经沙场的团长 乐意给我解释下你们怎么可能打赢
I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.

但愿这位老人家使剑功夫强过嘴上功夫
I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.

你们只有八千无垢者
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

你这么年轻就能当团长? 
You're very young to be a captain.

他不是团长 他是伍长
He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

即使按你说的人数来算 实力如此悬殊 获胜的机会微乎其微啊
Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.

次子团面对过更悬殊的情况 并赢得胜利
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.

次子团面对过更悬殊的情况 结果是逃跑
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.

你们可以考虑为我效力
Or you could fight for me.

我们已经拿了奴隶主的钱
We've taken the slavers' gold.

我会付你同样多的费用 甚至更多
I would pay you as much and more.

契约是我们的命脉
Our contract is our bond.

断了命脉 就没人愿跟次子团签契约了
If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.

为我效劳 次子团就无需再寻求雇主了
Ride with me and you'll never need another contract.

等我夺回七大王国时 你将得到财富 城堡和你想要的封号
You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

你没有船 也没有攻城武器
You have no ships. You have no siege weapons.

两星期前 我还没有军队
A fortnight ago, I had no army.

一年前 我甚至没有龙
A year ago, I had no dragons.

给你两天时间考虑
You have two days to decide.

快露出你的逼来 让我看看到底值不值得为之一战
Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.

你看起来挺喜欢我的酒
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

或许你需要一壶酒才能思考
Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.

那我军队里的兄弟怎么办? 
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

那就一桶 不错
A barrel, then. Good.

泰坦私生子可不会独个儿喝闷酒
The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

在我们次子团 东西都是共享的
In the Second Sons, we share everything.

等打完仗 我们没准会一起上了你
After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.

等这一切都完事儿后 我会来找你的
I'll come looking for you when this is over.

巴利斯坦爵士 开战后先杀这个人
Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

詹德利
'大牛' 铁匠学徒

你体内流淌着劳勃和贱民的血
Half Robert, half lowborn.

把这孩子带去他的房间
Show the boy to his chambers.

让女仆给他洗个澡 再找点得体的衣服给他穿上
Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.

我很快就会去看你
I'll come visit you soon.

你打算拿他怎么办? 
What do you mean to do with him?

你知道我的打算
You know what I mean to do with him.

那为什么还让他沐浴, 为他更衣? 
Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?

如果必须那样做的话 就赶紧完成 别折磨那孩子
If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

你宰过羊羔吗? 国王陛下? 
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

如果让羊羔看到刀子 它会恐惧
If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.

而恐惧会影响它的肉质 变得暗沉无味
Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.

你杀过很多羊羔? 
You've slaughtered many lambs?

没有一只看到了刀刃
And none have seen the blade.

坦格利安...  加… 驾
Targaryen...  rodrode

维桑尼亚 坦格利安 驾着瓦格哈尔 体型最小的那条龙 还是...  大得… 能… 能 能吞下整匹马
'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still...  large enog enoughenough to swallow a horse whole.'

你吃的饱吗? 
They feeding you enough?

冰凉的早餐 热乎的晚餐
Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.

你不适合这种地方
You don't belong in a place like this.

这个嘛 很抱歉这样说 不过我看过更糟糕的地方
Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

你儿子的事 真遗憾
I'm sorry about your son.

之前没机会跟你说
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

梅丽珊卓回来了
Melisandre's returned.

我连她走了都不知道
I didn't know she'd been gone.

带着个私生子回来
Came back with a bastard boy.

劳勃的私生子
Robert's bastard boy.

她说国王的血脉蕴含着力量
She says there's power in king's blood.

她要杀了他
She's going to kill him.

原谅我这样说 陛下 我没什么文化 不过 杀了他和献祭他之间有什么区别吗? 
Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?

那孩子是你的侄子
The boy is your nephew.

那又如何? 我们在打仗
What of it? We're at war.

凭什么放过一个酒馆婊子养的儿子? 
Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut

劳勃只是喝醉睡了她一晚 才有他的
Robert bedded one drunken night?

因为他血管中流着和你一样的血
Because he has your blood in his veins.

王座本应属于你 他却自称为王
Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.

他召集了军队 偷走了你的封臣
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

这孩子什么都没做
This boy has done you no harm.

他是无辜的  维斯特洛有多少男孩? 
He's an innocent. How many boys live in Westeros?

多少女孩? 多少男人 多少女人? 
How many girls? How many men? How many women?

她说到黑暗将把他们全部吞没
The darkness will devour them all, she says.

永不终结的长夜
The night that never ends.

我从没要求过这些
I never asked for this.

就像我从来没想要当国王
No more than I asked to be king.

我们无法选择命运 但必须履行职责 对不对? 
We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?

伟大抑或渺小 人人都必须履行自己的职责
Great or small, we must do our duty.

一个私生子怎么能和整个王国相提并论
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

陛下 你为什么来探视? 
Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?

只要你发誓 再也不伤害梅丽珊卓夫人
If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

但我无法承诺不出言反对她
I can't swear never to speak against her.

你就那么不在乎自己的性命
You have little regard for your own life.

确实 陛下
Quite little, Your Grace.

你本可以昨天或是明天释放我 但是你偏偏现在来 就在那孩子要躺在利刃下之前 因为你知道我会劝你
You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

你到这里来听我说 因为你自己心里也是这样认为的
You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.

你不是一个能滥杀无辜的人 不管是为了利益还是为了荣耀
You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory.

我儿子五岁的时候 他对我说
When my son was five he said to me,

我很想对他说 '你不会的 孩子 你永远不会死的 '
I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.'

我不想看到他在黑暗中醒着 心慌意乱
I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

我想肯定是孩子的父母们创造出了诸神 因为他们希望自己的孩子们可以在夜里睡得安稳
I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.

我在火焰里看到了
I saw a vision in the flames.

雪地里的大战
A great battle in the snow.

而且你也看到了她生下来的那东西
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

我以前从不相信 但是你看到了事实 事实就这样摆在眼前 像这些铁栅栏一样真实无误 你怎么还能否认她的神呢? 
I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?

那龙婊子 她的话太多了
Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.

让她含着我的老二 看她还有什么话好说
She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.

她和你的老二之间隔着 8000 个无垢者
8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock.

我的老二总能找到路子
My cock will find a way.

告诉他 有什么地方是我的老二进不去的吗? 
Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?

你付了钱 让她说什么都行
She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

达里奥・纳哈里斯 不喜欢婊子的婊子
Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.

我很喜欢她们 我只是拒绝付钱
I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them.

而且我不是婊子 我的朋友
And I'm no whore, my friend.

她卖她的'剑鞘' 你卖你的宝剑
She sells her sheath and you sell your blade.

有区别吗?   我为美而战
What's the difference? I fight for beauty.

在我们死掉之前 诸神赐予男人两件礼物 让我们开心 操想被操的女人 杀想杀你的男人
The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.

我们要拿那个龙女怎么办
What do we do about the dragon girl?

我们不能在战场上和 8000 个无垢者硬碰硬
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.

我们不打仗 我们用不着对付那些太监
There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.

我们只要对付她就行了
We only have to deal with her.

她被保护的很好  今晚是新月
She's well guarded. Tonight's a new moon.

我们中间的一个 避开那些无垢者和骑士 溜进她的帐篷
One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.

闭上眼睛 亲爱的
Close your eyes, love.

一个来自弥林 一个来自瓦兰提斯 还有一个来自布拉佛斯
A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos.

拿到布拉佛硬币的人去做
The Braavosi does the deed.

我们每个人都有份 亲爱的
One for each of us, darling.

跟着我的声音来 我就在这里
Follow my voice. I'm right here.

你看起来英姿飒爽 大人
You look very handsome, my lord.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 财政大臣

正如你的梦中情人
The husband of your dreams.

不过你真是太迷人了
But you do look glorious.

也许我们应该单独聊聊
Perhaps we could have a moment alone.

波德瑞克 你可以帮忙护送史塔克小姐的女仆吗? 
Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?

这不是我想要的
I didn't ask for this.

希望我没有让您失望 大人
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

你和我说话 不需要再像个阶下囚
You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore.

从今天开始 你不再是阶下囚
You won't be a prisoner after today.

或许那是另一种囚禁
I suppose that's a different kind of prison.

我只是努力想说却说不好
I'm just trying to say very badly

我只想 只想说我知道你现在的感觉
I just just want to say I know how you feel.

我不太相信这一点 大人
I doubt that very much, my lord.

我完全不了解你到底有什么感觉
I have no idea how you feel.

你也完全不了解我是什么感觉
And you have no idea how I feel.

但是我能保证一件事 我的夫人
But I promise you one thing, my lady.

我永远不会伤害你
I won't ever hurt you.

那么 今天你要喝
Well, today you have to.

你看起来容光焕发 殿下
You look radiant, Your Grace.

容光焕发? 为什么是容光焕发? 
Radiant? Why radiant?

因为这正是我心中所想的
It's the word that came to mind.

我们马上会成为姐妹
We're going to be sisters soon.

我们应该能成为好朋友
We should be friends.

你喜欢音乐 不是吗? 
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

我想你一定有副好嗓子
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

恐怕还是跳舞比唱歌拿手
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

好吧 但你可听说过'卡斯特梅的雨季'这首歌? 
Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?

当然 宫廷中常常演奏这首歌
Of course. They play it so often here at court.

所以你知道卡斯特梅城的雷耶斯家族喽
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?

我相信一定不如您了解
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

雷耶斯家族曾是个强大的家族
House Reyne was a powerful family.

维斯特洛第二富有的家族
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

现在提利尔家族是维斯特洛第二富有的家族了吧? 
Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?

毫无疑问 有野心的攀爬者怎么会逗留在 第二高的阶梯呢
Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung.

只要你再往上爬一步 你就能比别人都看得远
If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest.

陪伴你的只有头顶上蔚蓝的天空
You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.

所以雷耶斯伯爵造了一个城堡 和凯岩城一样宏伟
So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock.

他送给妻子的那些钻石 比我母亲戴过的任何一只都大
He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore.

终于有一天 他反叛了我的父亲
And finally one day, he rebelled against my father.

你可知雷耶斯家族现在怎样? 
Do you know where House Reyne is now?

为什么不说被杀光了? 
Why not say slaughtered?

每一个男人 女人 儿童 都死于利刃之下
Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.

我记得他们的尸体高高的悬挂在 凯岩城的城门之上
I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

我父亲让他们在那里腐烂了整整一个夏天
My father let them rot up there all summer.

那是一个漫长的夏天
It was a long summer.

如果你再叫我一声姐姐
If you ever call me sister again,

就会在睡梦中被掐死
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

作为七大王国的父亲 理应由我来送你出嫁
As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

你现在可以为新娘披上斗篷 将她置于你的保护之下
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.

国王陛下 太后陛下 大人们 夫人们 在此 在诸神和世人的见证下 新郎与新娘结为夫妻
Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife.

从今以后 他们就是一个躯体 一个心灵 一个魂魄 直到永远
One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.

你以前见过这些吗? 
Have you ever seen one like it?

这里的东西我都没见过
I've never seen anything like any of this.

当你第一次见到真正财富的时候 很令人吃惊 不是吗
It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth?

我像你这么大的时候 每天就靠一锅汤过活
When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

里面是什么就不好说了
And stew is a kind word for it.

在跳蚤窝 我们叫它褐粥
In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown.

我们假装里面的肉是鸡肉
We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.

但我们都知道那不是
We knew it wasn't chicken.

你觉得我想对你下毒? 
You think I'm trying to poison you?

你觉得它来自何处? 
Where do you think it's from?

我猜都不敢猜
I couldn't even guess.

那不重要 不是吗
Doesn't matter, does it?

真实或是虚假
It's the real thing or it's not.

你只需要用舌头来尝一尝
You only need a tongue to tell the difference.

继续吧 多喝点
Go on, have some more.

你还是不相信这一切
You still don't trust it.

认为全都是一场误会 而自己每喝一口都要付出代价
You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.

我的确这么想过
That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.

这里没有误会
There are no mistakes.

我在这里只是因为我父亲恰好上了我母亲 而不是酒馆里其他的女人
I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.

你父亲选择你母亲是光之王的旨意
Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.

你在这里也是他的旨意 你 还有你体内的力量 你对这些一点都不了解
He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand.

是光之王指引我来提取你体内的力量 并且让它降临到这个世界
And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.

我们都是他计划中的一部分
We're both a part of His plan.

他希望我们这样
He wants this for us.

不 他命令我们这样
No, He demands this of us.

我不明白 这… 这看上去不是很虔诚
I don't understand. This this doesn't seem very religious.

戴着她们严肃的表情 紧闭的双唇 还有干涸的阴道? 
With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts?

她们的神为你做过什么? 
What have their gods done for you?

当你向她们祈祷时 她们的回应在哪里?
When you pray to them, what's their answer?

真实或是虚假
A god is real or he's not.

你只需要用眼睛来看一看
You only need eyes to see.

死亡就要降临于万物
Death is coming for everyone and everything.

黑暗即将吞噬黎明
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.

我们可以阻止它 你和我
And we can stop it, you and I.

让我来展示一下你体内的力量
Let me show you what you have inside you.

来和我一起对抗死亡吧
Come fight death with me.

你必须信任我
You have to trust me.

别挣扎 别挣扎 它们吸不了多少
Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.

你这是干什么? 
Why are you doing this?

我告诉过你国王之血蕴含力量
I told you there's power in the blood of kings.

而你有这么多血
And you have so much blood.

那里不行 那里不行!
Not there. Not there!

你可以怨戴佛斯爵士
You can blame Ser Davos.

他不相信国王之血的力量
He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.

他想要一个证明
He wanted a demonstration.

求求您 求求您 陛下
Please. Please, Your Grace.

篡夺者罗柏・史塔克
The usurper Robb Stark.

篡夺者巴隆・葛雷乔伊
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

篡夺者乔佛里・拜拉席恩
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

那么他们的儿子会是你的侄子
So their son will be your nephew.

当然是在你娶了瑟曦之后
After you're wed to Cersei, of course.

你会是国王的继父 同时也是大舅子
And you will be the king's stepfather and brotherinlaw.

当你嫁给国王以后
When you marry the king,

乔佛里的母亲会是乔佛里的嫂子 而你们的儿子会是洛拉斯的外甥
Joffrey's mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras' nephew?

或者孙子?  我搞不清
Grandson? I'm not sure.

但是你的哥哥会是你的公公
But your brother will become your fatherinlaw.

这点绝对没有争议
That much is beyond dispute.

我能离开一会儿吗? 
Will you pardon me, my lord?

当然 当然 好… 好好玩
Of course. Of course. Enenjoy.

也许你更应该去找你的未婚妻聊聊
Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead.

我有一辈子的时间和她聊
I've got a lifetime for that.

你看上去醉的不轻
You seem rather drunk.

没我计划的那么醉
Rather less than I plan to be.

在自己婚礼上喝得大醉不是男人的职责么? 
Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?

关键的不是婚礼
This isn't about your wedding.

蓝礼・拜拉席恩也有个婚礼
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

你妻子需要个孩子 一个兰尼斯特孩子 越快越好
Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.

还有?  如果你要给他一个孩子 你需要有所行动
And? If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.

你有一次叫我什么来着? 
What did you once call me?

一个矮小 醉醺醺 充满淫欲的野兽
A drunken little lustfilled beast.

不止一次 那就是了
More than once. There you have it.

别担心
Nothing to worry about.

喝酒和淫乱 这些方面没人能比的上我
Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things.

我是乳头和美酒的神
I am the god of tits and wine.

我会在下次去的妓院那里 给自己造个神坛
I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.

你可以酩酊大醉 你可以花言巧语 你可以一直不成熟地挑衅 让你的父亲不快 但是你要完成你的职责
You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.

我的父亲曾经告诉过我…
My father once told me

没人操心你父亲告诉过你什么
Nobody cares what your father once told you.

恭喜你 小姐
Congratulations, my lady.

谢谢您 陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

不错 你成功了 你嫁给了个兰尼斯特
Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister.

马上你就会有一个兰尼斯特孩子
Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.

你的愿望实现了 不是吗
It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?

我想你不会太介意 让哪一个兰尼斯特上你吧
I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you.

也许今晚 在我舅舅喝醉之后 我会来找你
Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.

那也无妨 马林爵士和伊林爵士会帮你躺好的
That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.

闹新房的时间到了
Time for the bedding ceremony.

我不要闹新房
There will be no bedding ceremony.

你不是一向遵循传统的吗 舅舅? 
Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?

把她举起来 抬上婚床
Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.

脱了她的裙服 反正也用不着
Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer.

小姐们 你们负责帮我舅舅 他可不重
Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.

我不要闹新房
There will be no bedding ceremony.

我说闹就得闹
There will be if I command it.

那你自己闹新房时 只能用假鸡巴了
Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.

陛下 闹新房的事我们再商榷
I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.

我相信提利昂并非有意威胁国王
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.

这是个差劲的玩笑 陛下
A bad joke, Your Grace.

只因为我太嫉妒您高贵的命根子
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.

不知道我可怜的妻子到时候能不能察觉到它
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

陛下 您的舅舅明显醉地一塌糊涂
Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.

但是… 大婚之夜
But but it is my wedding night.

我和我醉醺醺的小鸡巴还有事要做
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

有次我干到一半 吐在了那姑娘身上
I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act.

但坦诚相待是小两口之间最重要的 你说是不是? 
But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?

来吧 我会全部告诉你
Come, I'll tell you all about it.

这样好吗 大人?
Is that wise, my lord?

这样好吗 提利昂? 
Is that wise, Tyrion?

没有比这更好的了
Nothing was ever wiser.

你多大了?
How old are you exactly?

好吧 说话也不会让你长大
Well, talk won't make you any older.

我的父亲大人命令我 必须完成这桩婚事
My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.

如果我的父亲希望谁遭殃
If my father wants someone to get fucked,

他自然知道该怎么做
I know where he can start.

在你接受我之前
I won't share your bed.

我是不会碰你的
Not until you want me to.

如果我说永远也不行呢?
What if I never want you to?

我从今开始守望
And so my watch begins.

怎么会有人能说十九种语言呢? 
How can anyone speak 19 languages?

陛下只花了一年就能不错地掌握多斯拉克语
It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

是啊 但我要么学会多斯拉克语 要么对着我丈夫瞎咕哝 然后期望他… 你说'不错'是什么意思? 
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope what do you mean reasonably well?

完整掌握多斯拉克语的发音十分困难
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.

颤音和浊音太多了
So guttural and harsh.

好吧 我有点疏于练习了
Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

您的高等瓦雷利亚语说的非常好 陛下
Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.

它是诸神创造的最完美的语言
The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.

只有它适合赋诗
It is the only proper language for poetry.

不许出声 否则她死定了
No screaming or she dies.

别尖叫哟 小可爱
Don't scream, lovely girl.

他们派你来杀我? 
You were sent here to kill me?

你的团长对此有何意见?
What do your captains have to say about that?

我们对某个哲学问题有不同见解
We had philosophical differences.

什么问题?  您的美貌
Over what? Your beauty.

对我来说这很重要 但他们不同意
It meant more to me than it did to them.

你这人真奇怪
You're a strange man.

我可是您见过的人当中最单纯的啦
I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.

只做自己想做的事
I only do what I want to do.

这个是用来取悦我的? 
And this is supposed to impress me?

为什么我要相信一个杀害自己同伴的人? 
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?

他们命令我除掉你
They ordered me to murder you.

我说 我不想杀
I told them I preferred not to.

他们说我别无选择
They told me I had no choice.

我告诉他们我是达里奥・纳哈里斯
I told them I am Daario Naharis.

选择总是有的
I always have a choice.

他们拔剑 我也拔剑
They drew their swords and I drew mine.

你愿意为我而战吗? 
Will you fight for me?

次子团是您的 达里奥・纳哈里斯是您的
The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.

我的宝剑是您的 我的生命是您的 我的心也是您的
My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.

你真应该先敲门
You really ought to knock.

我把早餐端来了
I brought your breakfast.

我们在这里过夜吧
We could stay here for the night.

生火到底能有多难?
How hard can it be to build a fire?

到皮毛底下来 我们可以互相取暖
Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.

他刚刚朝我挤眼了
He winked at me before.

没有吧  我看到他朝我挤眼了
I doubt it. I saw him wink at me.

挤眼和眨眼 这没有本质区别
I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.

呃 我是说 它们都一样
Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

挤眼是故意的
A wink is on purpose.

你真的没想过他的名字?
You thought of a name yet?

如果他有名字 涉及他的事说起来就容易多了
It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.

你说话有时那么讲究 是故意难为我? 
Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?

这就是我说话的方式
This is just the way I talk.

我来生火吧
I'll build that fire.

你真的不觉得该给他取个名字吗?
Don't you think he should have a name?

我知道的男孩名儿很少
I don't know many boys' names.

我想想 有邓肯
Let's see, there's Duncan,

这不错 但莫尔蒙是个姓
That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.

为什么它是个姓? 
Why is it a last name?

这么说吧 它是给一个家族用的
Well, it's a family name.

譬如 我叫山姆威尔・塔利
For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.

山姆威尔是我的名 塔利是我的姓
Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name.

明白了吗? 所以我的父亲也是一个塔利
You see? So my father is also a Tarly.

他也叫山姆威尔・塔利? 
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

蓝道是个好听的名字
Randyll is a handsome name.

千万别叫这孩子蓝道
Please don't name him Randyll.

你的父亲也像我的父亲一样残忍吗?
Is your father cruel like mine?

只是方式不同
Different manner of cruel.

他是为了孩子来的
It's come for the baby.

不 你不能带走他! 不要!
No, you can't have him! No!

你确定吗? 
Are you sure about this?

如果我们攻下泰温的老巢 维斯特洛的领主们就会知道他不是无敌的
If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.

夺走他的家园 他的财富 削弱他的实力
Take his home, take his gold, take his power.

你为什么要找我商量? 
Why are you telling me?

你恳求我不要派席恩 去与他父亲交涉 我没有听从你的建议
You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.

结果临冬城被烧成灰烬 北境被铁种蹂躏 还失去了布兰和瑞肯
Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone.

我想征询你的建议
I'm asking your advice.

只要瓦德・佛雷愿意合作
If Walder Frey cooperates.

只要瓦德・佛雷愿意合作
If Walder Frey cooperates.

如果在我们拿下城堡前 君临派出的援兵赶到… 我们就会被困在泰温的军队和大海之间
If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle...  we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.

我们就会输掉这场战争 像父亲那样背着谋逆的罪名死去
We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.

让他们尝尝失去挚爱的滋味
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

我尊贵的客人 欢迎进入我的城堡 来到我的桌边
My honored guests...  be welcome within my walls and at my table.

七神见证 我给予你们款待和保护
I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.

感谢您的慷慨好客 大人
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

我来是为了致以诚挚的歉意 大人 并且恳求您的宽恕
I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.

无需恳求我的宽恕 陛下
Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.

您摒弃的不是我 是我的女儿
It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.

她们中本应出个王后
One of them was supposed to be queen.

如今却旁落他人
Now none of them are.

这是我女儿艾雯
This is Arwyen my daughter.

我女儿瓦妲 我女儿德娃 我女儿瓦拉
My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.

我大孙女
My eldest granddaughters

双胞胎孙女西拉和撒拉
Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.

你可以在她们两个中任选一个
You could have had either.

或者都选了我也没意见
Could have had both for all I care.

我孙女玛蕊莲
My granddaughter Marianne.

我孙女法拉
My granddaughter Freya.

还有我的小女儿希琳 虽然她还没来潮
And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.

显然你不会对她们有兴趣
Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.

人人都必须信守承诺 尤其是身为君主的我
All men should keep their word, kings most of all.

我曾庄严发誓将迎娶您们中的一位 后来却背弃了誓言
I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.

这不是你们的错 而是我的过失
The fault is not with you.

可以得到你们中任何一位都是男人的幸运
Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.

布林登・徒利
'黑鱼' 凯特琳・徒利之叔

我并不是有意怠慢你们 而是因为我真心爱上一位女子
I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.

我明白 没有语言可以抚平 我对你们的家族和你们所造成的伤害
I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.

我恳求你们的原谅 并且愿意做一切可能的补偿 希望河渡口的佛雷家族和临冬城的史塔克家族 可以再度成为盟友
I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.

让我看看你
Let me have a look at you.

临冬城的史塔克家族是这么称呼它的 嗯? 
That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?

我说应该叫漂亮脸蛋
I call it a pretty face.

毫无疑问 比这儿的都漂亮
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.

曲线也不错
Very shapely as well.

噢 你想用衣服把她藏起来
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.

如果你真的想把她藏起来 那你一开始就不应该把她带到这儿来
If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.

我一眼就能看透 衣服底下是什么样子
I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.

这么多年我可不是白活的
Been at this a long time.

我敢打赌你脱掉这件衣服时 身材完全没走样
I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.

一寸也不会下垂
Doesn't drop an inch.

你的国王说他是为了爱情背叛我
Your king says he betrayed me for love.

我说他是为了这对坚挺的乳头 和紧实的小穴
I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.

这我可以理解啊
And I can respect that.

我像你这么大的时候 为了这种尤物 想都不用想就会打破 50 个誓言
When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought.

看来 这个大厅的空间只够你们这些人
Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.

我们会在外面搭起帐篷 给你其余的人马提供食物和麦酒
We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.

好了 让我们准备好吧
Well, let's get ready.

酒浆斟起来 音乐奏起来 让我们把这些杂七杂八的事都抛到脑后
The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 熊老之子

这儿 这是个后门
There. It's a back gate.

我的人穿过这儿去光顾渊凯的床奴
My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

你的人 但没有你? 
Your men, but not you?

我对奴隶没有性趣
I have no interest in slaves.

一个男人不应该和物品做爱
A man cannot make love to property.

我们就是从这儿进入城市
This is where we enter the city.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
'无谓的'女王铁卫

守卫很少 他们认识我
Very few guards. They know me.

我们没法让一整支军队通过后门潜入城市
We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.

我会杀了守卫兵 带上你手下最强的两个人 带他们穿过我熟知的深巷 打开大门
I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.

一旦城墙被破 城池将顷刻不保
Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.

你也有可能让灰虫子和我陷身屠杀 让我们军队成为无头之师
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.

渊凯的首领会给你奖赏 你也不用把这份奖赏和其他两个人分了
The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways

因为你早就把你的搭档灭口了
'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.

你这人倒是疑心很重啊
You have a very suspicious mind.

就我看来 只有奸诈之人才会这么想
In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.

你是统领无垢者的人
You command the Unsullied.

我可以助你一臂之力
You can use an extra sword.

巴利斯坦爵士 你是女王铁卫
You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.

你该留在女王身边
Your place is by the queen.

若我们真心效忠于她 就该万死不辞 不惜代价 无虑荣耀
If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

我们现在是在黑城堡的西边 不过长夜堡离我们最近
We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.

这是长城上的第一座城堡
It was the first castle on the Wall.

守夜人军团在杰赫里斯一世时期就将它遗弃了
The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

因为它太过庞大 难以维持
Too big. Impossible to maintain.

相对于黑城堡 长夜堡是对我们来说最完美的堡垒
Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.

它有一个秘密的出入口 那就是跟长城同样古老的黑门
It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.

它通往长城
No one's used it in centuries most likely.

正好落在长夜堡之中 恐怕几百年来都没有人使用过它 直到有人发现了它 那人就是我
It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens, I do.

你是怎么知道这些的? 
How do you know all that?

我在一本古籍中读到过
I read about it in a very old book.

你就是靠盯着书上那些符号 知道所有这些的吗? 
You know all that from staring at marks on paper?

你真像个巫师
You're like a wizard.

我们的父亲曾经告诉我们 从来没有野人能活着看到长城
Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.

记住那个逃跑孩子的下场
Remember what happens to children who run.

我现在是你的父亲 一切由我来开口
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

这些路真是糟糕透了啊
The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they?

今早已经弄坏三个轮轴了
Cracked three spokes this morning.

来帮你一把?   十个你也不够哎
Need a hand? Need about eight hands.

我得在婚礼之前 按时把这些咸猪肉运到孪河城
Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding.

死人才不会开口
Dead rats don't squeak.

你真是残酷
You're so dangerous, aren't you?

对小女孩们说那些恐怖的东西
Saying scary things to little girls.

杀害小男孩和老人
Killing little boys and old people.

你可真是冷酷无情
A real hard man you are.

我比你见过的任何人都冷酷无情
More than anyone you know.

你错了 我认识一个杀手
You're wrong. I know a killer.

一个真正的杀手  所以呢? 
A real killer. That so?

你在他面前就是个渣
You'd be like a kitten to him.

他动一动小手指就能让你毙命
He'd kill you with his little finger.

总有一天你的善心会葬送你的性命
Someday it'll get you killed.

'筑城者'布兰登将这片土地 赠予了守夜人 以维持生计
Brandon the Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support.

鲁温学士教过我这些
Maester Luwin taught me that.

如今这里渺无人烟
Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.

这是块好地方 也没有战乱
It's good land and there's no war up here.

他们从长城过来 进行掠夺 偷盗 抢掳妇孺
But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.

老奶妈说他们会把你的头骨当杯子 强迫你从里面饮下自己的鲜血
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.

老奶妈就是那么说的
That's what Old Nan said.

风暴要降临了
There's a storm coming.

这是一个很好的庇护地
It's as good a place to shelter as any.

我们在休息的时候可以喝点血
We can drink some blood while we wait.

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人掠袭者

欧瑞尔
'鹰眼' 易形者

只有一个老人和八匹好马
Only one old man and eight good horses.

一个老人拿八匹马做什么? 
What's one old man doing with eight horses?

他为守夜人饲养这些马
He breeds them for the Watch.

耶哥蕊特
'火吻而生' 野人

他如何防止当地人偷马? 
How's he keep folks from stealing them?

守夜人会保护他的
The Watch protects him.

如今不会了
Not today they don't.

他正在卖马 他那里有些金子
He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.

还有好的铁器  我们去宰了他
And proper steel. Let's carve him up.

我们只要牵走那些马就够了
We just take the horses and go.

这个老人构不成威胁
The old man's no threat.

一枪贯穿他的心脏 可比独自苟延残喘 除了几匹马外无人相伴要好多了
A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.

守夜人有可能会派几个人来预防偷马的人
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.

他们会派更多的人来抓捕杀人犯
They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

在城堡里杀他们很困难
Killing crows in their castle is tough.

在这种空旷的场地杀死他们 却是我们擅长的
Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do.

包围这小屋再进去
Surround the hut and move in.

你把这些猪肉都吃了 就装不成猪农了
No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.

这可是最美味的部位
Best part of the animal.

别担心 他们还在那儿
Don't worry. They're still there.

我知道他们还在那儿
I know they're still there.

你每五分钟查看一遍 难不成是怕他们走了么
You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.

你都快到那儿了 你怕最后会做不到
You're almost there, and you're afraid you won't make it.

你离它越近 就越害怕
The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.

你没有必要掩饰
No point in trying to hide behind that face.

我见得太多了
I know fear when I see it.

我看着你的时候就嗅出了恐惧
I knew fear when I saw it in you.

你害怕火
You're afraid of fire.

当贝里的剑引上火焰的时候 你看上去就像个吓坏了的小姑娘
When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.

我听说过你哥哥对你做的事
I heard what your brother did to you.

把你的脸按进火中 就好像你是块美味多汁的羊腿
Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

你从这上面得到主意了? 
That give you some ideas?

甚至可能一个人到那儿
Might even make it there on your own.

他们就在河对岸
They're just over the river.

这是自从伊林・派恩砍了你老爸的脑袋之后 你离你家人最近的一次
The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

总有一天我要一剑捅进你的眼睛 一直捅到你的脑袋后面
Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.

你打算怎么通过长城? 
How are we going to get past the Wall?

我叔叔说它有 700 尺高
My uncle said it's 700 feet high.

你是怎么过来的? 
How did you get past it?

我坐上一条小船然后从海豹湾划过来的
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

我们要去海豹湾得花上两个月
It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.

有人则是直接爬过冰墙的
Some climb straight up the ice.

就算是阿多也没办法背着我爬长城
Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.

十九座城堡守卫着长城
19 castles guard the Wall.

现在只有三座还有人把守 阿多!
Only three are still manned. Hodor!

也许其中一座可以让我们通过
One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.

我叔叔说 城堡废弃时 会用冰和石头封门
My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.

那我们就把它们挖开
Well, we'll have to open them up again.

驾 驾 驾! 那边有骑手
Whoa, whoa, whoa! There's a rider out there.

闪电罢了 小巨人 阿多
It's just thunder, sweet giant. Hodor.

毛毛狗和夏天哪去了? 
Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

嘘 安静 阿多 阿多!
Shh, quiet, Hodor. Hodor!

让他闭嘴 如果他们听到了…
Make him shut up. If they hear us...

安静 阿多 不…  别再'阿多阿多'叫了 阿多!
Hush, Hodor. Nono more Hodoring. Hodor!

阿多! 阿多 冷静
Hodor! Hodor, calm down.

你必须保持安静 他们会听到我们的
You need to keep quiet. They're gonna hear us.

啊! 阿多! 阿多 冷静
Ah! Hodor! Hodor, calm down.

阿多! 阿多! 阿多 安静!
Hodor! Hodor! Hodor, be quiet!

那是一匹要死的马
That's a horse dying.

把他们带过来
Bring them over here.

这是最后一些了 其他的都死了
That was the last of them. The rest are dead.

我听到上面有叫声
I heard shouting up there.

我能分辨打雷和叫声的区别
I know the difference between shouting and thunder.

这帮不了你 老爷子
That won't help you, grandpa.

这已经不重要了 不是吗? 
Doesn't matter now, does it?

的确 不重要了
No, it doesn't matter now.

杀了他 不然他会警告乌鸦们我们来了
Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.

至少让我站着死
Let me stand at least.

毛毛狗
'毛毛' 瑞肯・史塔克的冰原狼

让我死得有尊严
Let me go with a bit of dignity.

让那个乌鸦去解决他
Make the crow kill him.

你现在是我们的人 证明你自己吧
You're one of us now. Prove it.

狼就在那
The wolves are out there.

我没法那么做
I can't do it by choice.

我不知道该怎么做 这种事只在我的梦里发生过
I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.

你刚才就对他做了
You just did with him.

一头狼跟这个比根本算不上什么
A wolf is nothing compared to that.

我跟你说过 他还是个乌鸦
I told you. He's still one of them.

他始终是个乌鸦
He'll always be a crow.

现在他的乌鸦老婆还护着他
And here's his crow wife guarding him.

他一有机会就会对我们出手
He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.

他是我们的人 不!
He's one of them. No!

你不能为了一只乌鸦丧命的
You're not gonna die for one of them.

如果你不杀了他 他们会发现我们的
They'll find us if you don't.

你一直都是对的
You were right the whole time.

如果听到鸟叫 你就过来
When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come.

我口哨吹得很棒 这片大陆上最好的
I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land.

也许还有别人 我很怀疑
There may be others. I doubt it.

渊凯更愿意让他们的奴隶为他们作战
The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.

这就是你说的'几个守卫'? 
That's what you call a few guards?

来啊! 看你有啥本事 哈? 
Come on! What do you got, huh?

希望我没有让你失望
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

您是我的骄傲 小姐
You're a delight to me, my lady.

你现在可以为新娘披上斗篷 将她置于你的保护之下
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.

在七神的见证下
In the sight of the Seven,

我在这里宣布这两个灵魂的结合 他们将永远联系在一起
I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.

看着对方并说出誓言
Look upon each other and say the words.

少女 老妪 陌客
Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

我属于她… 我属于他 她属于我… 他属于我…
I am hers... I am his...  and she is mine... and he is mine...

…从今往后 直到永远
...from this day until the end of my days.

安全了吗?  他们早就走了
Is that safe? They're long gone.

只要我愿意 我随时能进入夏天
I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.

长城以北也有野人 可以控制各种动物
North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.

但是你比他们更厉害
But you did a lot more than that.

你能进入阿多
You got inside Hodor's mind.

在长城以北的人做不到吗? 
They can't do that north of the Wall?

没人能做到… 哪都没有
No one can do that...  anywhere.

当我通过夏天的眼睛看出去时
When I was looking through Summer's eyes,

他和野人在一起
He was with the wildlings.

他们试图杀了他 但是他逃走了
They tried to kill him, but he got away.

那他会回黑城堡去的
He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then.

那是他该去的地方
That's where we should go.

据我所知 黑城堡应该已经受到攻击了
For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack.

如果有这么多野人过来了的话…  我已经告诉过你了
If this many wildlings got throughI already told you.

我不去长城以北
I'm not going north of the Wall.

玖建告诉我的一切都是真的
Everything Jojen told me is true.

你看见我对阿多做了什么
You saw what I did to Hodor.

我必须找到三眼乌鸦
I have to find the threeeyed raven.

听我说 小主人
Listen to me, little lord.

我没有要你跟我一起去
I'm not asking you to come with me.

那对瑞肯来说太危险了
It won't be safe for Rickon.

我?  我跟你一起去
Me? I'm coming with you.

你和欧莎还有毛毛狗去最后的壁炉城
You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.

安柏家是我们的封臣 他们会保护你们
The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.

我必须保护你
I have to protect you.

现在是我保护你
Right now I have to protect you.

罗柏在打仗 而我要去长城以北
Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.

如果我们遭遇了什么 你就是临冬城的继承人
If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell.

你知道怎么找到最后的壁炉城吗? 
Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?

你们南方佬给自己造了大城堡 哪都去不了
You southerners build your big castles and you never move.

我们可不是南方佬
We're not southerners.

我也不想离开你
And I don't want to leave you.

嘘 嘘 过来 小战士
Shh, shh. Come here, little soldier.

你和我 我们将会去一起冒险
You and me, we're gonna have some adventures.

你无需这样做
You don't have to do any of this.

你家的人收留了我 他们完全没必要这么做 但他们还是对我很好
Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.

你会没事的 你和我
We'll be fine, you and me.

安柏家的人都是伟大的战士
The Umbers are great warriors.

就连我小时候都听说过
Even I heard about them growing up.

他们会教你如何使剑
They'll teach you how to swing a sword.

我知道怎么使剑
I know how to swing a sword.

你要走了吗?  现在可是深夜啊
You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.

我知道如何在黑暗中赶路
I learned to walk in darkness.

说再见吧 小家伙
Say your goodbyes, little man.

他对我意味着一切
He means the world to me.

我们等了太久了
We've been waiting a long time.

我对这种事一窍不通 你来说说
I don't know, you tell me.

洗劫一个城市需要多久
How long does it take to sack a city?

正如你所说
It was just as you said.

到最后一刻他们都还不相信
They did not believe until it was too late.

他们的奴隶战士 扔掉了长矛投降了
Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.

城市是你的了 我的女王
The city is yours, my queen.

他们很不错 不是吗? 
They're good, aren't they?

他们必须不错 请他们可不便宜
They ought to be because they cost enough.

看那家伙
Look at the crowd there.

他从奔流城启程时就开始 一直在抱怨这桩婚事 现在再看他
He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun, and now look at him.

诸神喜欢给傻瓜便宜
The gods love to reward a fool.

他是我侄子 我爱他
He's my nephew. I love him.

他是个大傻瓜
And he's a damned fool.

你不喝酒吗 波顿大人? 
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

从不 夫人 酒让人迟钝
Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.

你不是也娶了一个佛雷女孩的吗? 
Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?

瓦德大人让我从他的孙女中选一个 并且许诺跟这女孩等重的银子作为嫁妆
Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.

所以我挑了个年轻的胖新娘
So I have a fat young bride

我希望她能让你快乐
I hope she makes you very happy.

嗯 她已经让我很有钱了
Well, she's made me very rich.

请原谅 大人 夫人
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

我得找棵树撒泡尿
I need to find a tree to piss on.

我母亲独自对付卢斯・波顿
My mother's alone with Roose Bolton.

我认识的女人当中 你母亲最不需要拯救
Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.

她终于开始喜欢你了
She's finally starting to like you.

但是如果她能如愿 我将回到瓦兰提斯 玩我的竖琴 而你将坐在那儿 让萝丝琳・佛雷喂你吃黑莓
But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.

也许我做了非常错误的决定
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

打国王可是叛国罪啊
Striking your king is an act of treason.

修士的虔诚话也说过啦 小两口子的诺言也许下啦 艾德慕大人 也给我女儿披上了斗篷
The septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said, and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.

但是他们还不是夫妇
But they are not yet man and wife.

宝剑配好鞘
A sword needs a sheath.

婚礼入洞房
And a wedding needs a bedding.

陛下您怎么说
What does my sire say?

洞房! 洞房! 洞房!
To bed! To bed! To bed!

如果你认为是时候了 瓦德大人 就开始吧!  就开始吧!
If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.

洞房! 洞房! 洞房!
To bed! To bed! To bed!

噢 小心点 女士们
Oh! Careful now, ladies.

一旦你们放猛兽出笼 可就再关不回去了
Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again.

洞房! 洞房! 洞房!
To bed! To bed! To bed!

每个新娘都会受此待遇
Every bride suffers the same.

我相信你也优雅地忍受了你的
I'm sure you endured yours with grace.

他说新婚之夜就打碎别人的下巴可不太好
He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.

真是个奇怪的风俗
That is a very strange custom.

我猜在外人看起来 似乎是挺奇怪的
I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.

你觉得这挺正常? 
It seems normal to you?

要是没有闹洞房 就没有证据 证明男女已经成婚
Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.

还有别的证据可以证明
But there are other ways of providing proof.

但是如果是男孩 我知道我们该给他取什么名字
But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him.

在我看来父亲有权给自己的儿子命名
It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.

你不希望教导小奈德 怎么骑马吗? 
Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?

驾 驾 驾 驾
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

去送婚宴要用的腌肉
Got salt pork for the feast.

听起来不像结束啊
Doesn't sound like it's over.

我告诉你结束就结束了
If I tell you it's over, it's over.

还不调头快滚
Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.

你脑袋坏掉了吗? 
Are you soft in the head?

快调头
Turn this cart around.

我觉得好像怠慢了 我的职责
I feel I've been remiss in my duties.

我给你们提供了酒肉和音乐 但是我还没有给你们 真正的款待
I've given you meat and wine and music, but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve.

我的国王已经成婚 我还欠我的王后一件婚礼的礼物
My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

你准备回临冬城的家了 对吗? 
You ready to head home to Winterfell, right?

婚宴结束了吗? 
Feast over yet, is it?

北境之王站起来了
The King in the North arises.

放他走 我发誓我们会遗忘
Let him go and I swear that we will forget this.

我向新旧诸神发誓
I swear it by the old gods and new.

我们绝不会复仇
We will take no vengeance.

你已经在我的城堡向我许过一个誓言了
You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.

你向诸神发誓你的儿子将会娶我的一个女儿
You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter!

留我当人质吧 放罗柏离开
Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go.

我凭什么放他走? 
And why would I let him do that?

以我身为徒利家人的荣誉 以我身为史塔克家人的荣誉 放他走 否则我就割了你妻子的喉咙
On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat.

兰尼斯特家向您致以问候
The Lannisters send their regards.

走 撤! 北境之王!
Go, move out! The King in the North!

北境之王!
The King in the North!

北境之王! 北境之王!
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王! 北境之王!
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王驾到!
Here comes the King in the North!

北境之王驾到!
Here comes the King in the North!

北境之王! 北境之王!
The King in the North! The King in the North!

提利昂・兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 财政大臣

杀人清单? 
A list of people you mean to kill?

在你眼中我和乔佛里没两样是吗? 
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

不 杀人这种做法是有点极端
No, death seems a bit extreme.

应该说是 死亡带来的恐惧…
Fear of death, on the other hand...

你该学会视而不见
You should learn to ignore them.

夫人 人们嘲笑我 要比嘲笑你久远多了
My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you.

我是半人 小魔猴 小恶魔
I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

而我却是叛徒奈德・史塔克的女儿
I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.

叛徒的女儿和小魔猴
The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.

我们真是天生一对
We're perfect for each other.

那我们该怎么教训他们? 
So how should we punish them?

艾尔德瑞克・萨斯菲尔德爵士和戴斯蒙・克雷赫大人
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

我可以和瓦里斯大人谈谈 打听一下他们有什么变态嗜好
I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.

取名叫'戴斯蒙・克雷赫'的人一定是个变态
Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

我听说你就是个变态
I hear that you're a pervert.

我有自己的一套规矩
I have certain standards to maintain.

我们可以拿戴斯蒙大人的床玩塞羊进去的把戏
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.

在他的床垫上开一个洞 把羊粪塞进去
You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside.

然后把洞缝好 把床重新整理好
Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.

他的房间会很臭 而他找不到臭味是从哪儿来的
His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.

我妹妹跟我闹别扭时就这么整过我
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.

她经常跟我闹别扭
And she was always angry with me.

大粪听起来太粗俗了
That's the vulgar word for dung.

令尊传您去参加御前会议
Your father has called a meeting of the small council.

今天又杀了几只小狗仔? 
Killed a few puppies today?

'萝丝琳套住一条肥美鳟鱼

她的兄弟们为婚礼献上两张狼皮为礼

这文掉得还真蹩脚呢 到底是什么意思? 
Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?

他的贱人老娘也死啦!
And his bitch mother.

快回信给瓦德大人
Write back to Lord Frey.

感谢他的效力 命令他 送回罗柏・史塔克的人头
Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head.

等我结婚时 要亲手把这个交给珊莎
I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.

陛下 珊莎夫人可是您舅妈
Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

小乔在开玩笑 他不是认真的
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

等我结婚时 要亲手把这个交给珊莎
I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.

你休想再折磨她
She is no longer yours to torment.

我想整谁就整谁
Everyone is mine to torment.

你给我记住 小怪物
You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.

那你更应该对我礼貌些
Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.

怪物可是很危险的 而且这世道 杀个国王跟摁死只苍蝇差不多
Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.

如此口出狂言 我要拔了你的舌头
I could have your tongue out for saying that.

就让他威胁吧
Let him make his threats.

哼 他不过是个满腹牢骚的小可怜虫罢了
Hmm? He's a bitter little man.

提利昂大人应该立即道歉
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

让人忍无可忍 目无尊长 而且非常低俗
Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.

任何大声声明'我是国王'的人 根本当不了真正的王者
Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king.

等我替你赢下这场战争 我会教你明白这一点的
I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.

我的父亲才赢下了真正的战争
My father won the real war.

他亲手杀掉雷加王子 赢得王冠 而这时候呢 你却躲在凯岩城里不敢出来
He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!

护送他回房
See him to his chambers.

来吧 我不累
Come along. I'm not tired.

我们有很多值得庆贺的事
We have so much to celebrate.

还有一场婚礼要策划 你必须休息了
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

大学士 也许弄点安眠酒 以帮助他入睡
Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.

你刚把维斯特洛最有权势的人 空着肚子送上床
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.

如果你认为他是维斯特洛最有权势的人 你就是个傻瓜
You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.

叛国言论 乔佛里可是国王
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.

你真认为王冠能带来权力? 
You really think a crown gives you power?

我认为军队才能带来权力
I think armies give you power.

嗯 罗柏・史塔克有支军队 从没输过一场战役 还不是被你给打败了
Mmhmm. Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.

我猜 这次瓦德・佛雷是非功过
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

一肩挑了 就看你是否支持他
Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance.

瓦德・佛雷这人个性很复杂 但要说他勇敢? 
Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?

若非别人作出承诺 谅他没胆子单独行动
He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.

我给了他承诺
Which he got from me.

兵不厌诈 这就是战争
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

但在婚宴上大开杀戒…
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

我倒是不明白 在战场上屠杀一万士兵 与在餐桌边干掉十来个人相比 前者有何高尚之处
Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.

所以您这么干? 
So that's why you did it?

为了结束战争 为了保护族人
To end the war. To protect the family.

你想为死去的史塔克一族写首歌吗? 
Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?

我在这世上保卫兰尼斯特家族 保护亲人 的时间比你长些
I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

北方人绝不会忘了这事
The northerners will never forget.

等他们向南方行军时 务必记得这一切
Let them remember what happens when they march on the south.

史塔克家族的人都死了
All the Stark men are dead.

临冬城成了废墟
Winterfell is a ruin.

卢斯・波顿将被册封为北境守护 直到你和珊莎的儿子长大成人
Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.

那方面你还得加把劲
I believe you still have some work to do on that score.

那您觉得珊莎会乖乖配合吗?  在我告诉她我们谋杀了她的母亲和哥哥之后?
Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?

不管怎样 你得让那姑娘怀孕
One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.

要我简短地给你上一课 教你如何看清这世道吗? 
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?

劳烦您说简单点 我可没您聪明
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

将家人放在首位的家族 总会击败那些 任由子女胡作非为的家族
The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first.

一个称职的人会竭尽所能 为亲人谋福祉 而非出于个人私欲
A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.

不 这是很好的一课
No, it's a very good lesson.

这个家是由您一个人说了算的 您当然希望每个人都一心一意服务于这个家
Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.

您什么时候做事不是出于个人私欲 什么时候又是纯为了家人的利益着想? 
When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?

你出生的那一天
The day that you were born.

我想把你扔进海里 让海浪把你冲走
I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.

但我却让你活了下来
Instead, I let you live.

作为儿子养大
And I brought you as my son.

因为你还算是个兰尼斯特
Because you're a Lannister.

我们找个地方睡觉
Let's find a place to sleep.

也许我们不该待在这儿
Maybe we shouldn't stay.

你情愿待在外面? 
You'd rather be out there?

关于这地方 流传着很多故事
There are a lot of stories about this place.

我总喜欢听恐怖故事
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

你听过鼠厨师的故事吗? 
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

他只是守夜人中的一名厨师
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

他因为什么事生国王的气
He was angry at the king for something,

国王访问长夜堡时 厨师杀死了国王的儿子 和洋葱 胡萝卜 蘑菇 培根一起 做成了一个大馅饼
When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.

那天夜里他将馅饼呈给国王
That night he served the pie to the king.

国王津津有味地吃着自己亲儿子的肉 并叫厨师再来一块
He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice.

后来 诸神把厨师变成一只巨大的白老鼠 只能吃自己的小孩
The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young.

从此以后 他就在长夜堡内游荡 吞食子孙
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies.

但无论如何 饥饿感却永远无法满足
But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.

要是诸神把所有的杀人犯 都变成大白老鼠…
If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat

诸神不是因为谋杀而诅咒鼠厨师 也不是因为给国王吃自己儿子做的馅饼
It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie.

但是杀害自家屋檐下的宾客
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

践踏宾客权利 诸神绝不原谅
That's something the gods can't forgive.

老徒利曾经称呼我'迟到的瓦德・佛雷' 因为我没有及时出兵到三叉戟河
'The late Walder Frey,' old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.

他自以为精明
He thought he was witty.

而如今呢 老徒利
Look at us now, Tully.

你已经死了 你女儿也死了 你的外孙也死了 你儿子在地牢里度过了新婚之夜 而我 成了奔流城公爵
You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

'黑鱼'逃走了
The Blackfish escaped.

不过是个流亡的老头子 孤立无援
An old man on the run with no allies.

我有泰温・兰尼斯特撑腰
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.

他还有谁?  言之有理
Who does he have? As you say.

他们都嘲笑我 那些个高高在上的领主们
They all laughed at me, all those high lords.

一个个都自以为比我强
They all thought they were better than me.

奈德・史塔克 霍斯特・徒利
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

我娶个年轻姑娘他们也笑话 当年琼恩・艾林娶徒利家的小骚货时 他们怎么不去叽歪
People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?

你得再娶个年轻姑娘咯
You'll be needing a new young girl.

咱得合计合计这事儿
Got that to look forward to.

而你 成了北境守护
And you, the Warden of the North.

再也不用向史塔克们俯首称臣了
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

真是苦了你了 一路跟着那个傻小子征战
Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.

他从来没有听从我的建议
He ignored my advice at every turn.

假如当初他稍微收敛一点…
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

竟然自称少狼主
Calling himself the Young Wolf.

瞧给他得瑟的
How's that for pomposity?

敬少狼主
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

战争已经结束了 你会搬去临冬城住么
Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?

总归是会的吧
At some point perhaps.

然而临冬城已经成了一片废墟
But Winterfell's in ruins.

那里究竟发生了什么
What happened up there?

听说被那个葛雷乔伊家的儿子占领了
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

他宰了所有的信鸦
I heard he killed all the ravens.

那以后就没信儿了
And after that, nothing.

我派了私生子拉姆斯去讨伐他
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

罗柏・史塔克对那些铁民给予特赦 只要他们把席恩交出来
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.

拉姆斯把话带过去了
Ramsay delivered the terms.

铁民交出了席恩 预料之中的事
The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would.

五花大绑地交了出来
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

他有他自己的行事方式
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

看来 姑娘们句句属实啊
Well, the girls weren't lying.

你那话儿还真不小
You had a goodsized cock.

你以为我是哪来的野人么? 
You think I'm some sort of savage?

人们说起幻肢
People talk about phantom limbs.

一个人就算被砍掉了脚 他也会感觉到原先有脚的地方会痒
An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.

所以 我就纳闷了… 太监是不是也有'幻鸡巴'? 
So I've always wondered...  do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

当你以后想到裸女 你的幻鸡巴会不会有点痒? 
Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?

我不该开玩笑
I shouldn't make jokes.

妈妈教过我不要对残废扔石头
My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.

但是我父亲说 瞄准脑袋再扔
But my father taught me to aim for their head.

你死了对我又没什么好处
You're no good to me dead.

你看起来都不像'席恩・葛雷乔伊'了
You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

那是贵族的名字
That's a name for a lord.

而你不是什么贵族 是吧
But you're not a lord, are you?

这名字蛮适合你啊
That's a good name for you.

别杀我! 什么人? 
Don't kill me! Who are you?

山姆! 山姆! 你是什么人? !
Sam! Sam! Who are you?!

我叫吉莉 不要伤害我们
Gilly. Don't hurt us.

去黑城堡 我是一名守夜人
To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

我哥哥 他也在守… 嘘
My brother, he's in the Night'sShush.

你哥哥是谁?  那不重要
Who's your brother? Doesn't matter.

你是琼恩的弟弟
You're Jon's brother.

那个从窗户坠下去的
The one who fell from the window.

我认识白灵 知道冰原狼长什么样
I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.

我也听说过阿多
And I've heard all about Hodor.

要不是琼恩 我早没命了
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

如果你是他的弟弟 那么你也是我的兄弟
If you're his brother, you're my brother, too.

我会尽我所能帮助你
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

带我们去长城以北
Take us north of the Wall.

你怎么会想去…
Why in the world would you want to go

我不是想去 我必须去
I don't want to. I have to.

你们是怎么穿过长城的? 
How did you get through the Wall?

那口井是不是通向地下河?  你们是从那儿过来的么? 
Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?

长城南面刻有阶梯
There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.

阿多可以背你上去
Hodor can carry you to the top.

我们直接回到黑城堡
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

跟我们走吧 长城以北只有死路一条
Come with us. There's nothing north but death.

琼恩如果还活着 他会回黑城堡去的
If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be.

你们在那里最安全
It's the safest place for you.

现在不管哪里都不在安全 你知道的
There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.

我亲眼见到过
What I know is what I saw.

如果你也见到了 你绝不会往那儿走
And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.

你见到异鬼和亡者大军
You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.

你怎么知道的? 
How do you know all that?

守夜人抵挡不了它们
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

维斯特洛所有的国王和他们的军队都抵挡不了
The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.

你们这是要去抵挡它们? 
But you're going to stop them?

'巴隆・葛雷乔伊 铁群岛公爵 和北境的入侵者
'Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North.

限你在满月之前 令麾下所有的铁种杂碎们离开北境 滚回你们沾满臭粪的石头上 你们所谓的老家
I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shitstained rocks you call a home.

然后到了满月的那一夜
On the first night of the full moon,

我会捉住每一个 留在我们地盘的岛民 活剥了他们的皮 就像我剥了临冬城的那
I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum

二十个铁民渣滓的皮一样
I found at Winterfell.

盒子里有一份送给你们的小礼物
In the box you'll find a special gift

席恩最爱的玩具
Theon's favorite toy.

我给他割下来的时候他还哭了
He cried when I took it away from him.

立刻从北境撤军 否则我会送更多盒子过来 每个盒子里都有你们的席恩
Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.

署名 拉姆斯・雪诺 恐怖堡公爵 北境守护
Signed Ramsay Snow, naturalborn son of Roose Bolton,

卢斯・波顿的亲生儿子
Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.'

把那玩意儿拿走
Get that out of my sight.

席恩不听我的指挥
Theon disobeyed my orders.

他没法给葛雷乔伊家传宗接代了
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

我不会放弃已经占领的地盘 拿下的要塞
I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken.

快拿走
Get this away from me.

他连个男人都不是了
He's not a man anymore.

我决心已定
I've made my decision.

我要乘舰队里最快的船
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.

我要挑选铁群岛上最厉害的五十个杀手
I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

我要沿着狭海北上 驶入泪江
I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water.

我要向恐怖堡进发
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

我要找到我的弟弟 然后 我要带他回家
I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.

是我们在拳峰发现的
We found them at the Fist.

很久以前 有人埋在那里
Someone buried them a long time ago.

希望被我们找到
Someone wanted us to find them.

为什么? 它们有什么用? 
Why? What are they for?

能杀死异鬼
Killing white walkers.

你怎么知道? 
How do you know that?

那个异鬼冲着我的孩子走来
The walker came for my baby.

但是几千年来都没有人杀死过异鬼
But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.

总归有人第一个吃螃蟹吧
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.

我面对一个异鬼 侥幸逃生
I got lucky with one of them.

而且每一个异鬼 伴随着的尸鬼 数不胜数
And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count.

真希望你们能跟我们走
I wish you'd come with us.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
'洋葱骑士' 史坦尼斯的首相

詹德利
'大牛' 劳勃・拜拉席恩的私生子

只是一点血罢了
It was just a bit of blood.

只要有出身名门的人打听我的名字 准没好事
Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

在你们看来 我们就不算做人 是么
We're not really people to you, are we?

只是你们达成目的的各种手段而已
Just a million different ways to get what you want.

我并非出身名门 她管你叫'爵士'
I'm not a highborn. She called you Ser.

那是后来的事了
A recent state of affairs.

我和你一样 也是在跳蚤窝出生的
I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.

你是我的朋友 来救我的咯
You're my friend. You're here to help.

我在面粉街下面一带住过
I lived below the Street of Flour.

离红堡又有多近? 
How close to the Red Keep were you?

从红堡下水道涌出的屎尿 沿着制革道流向伊耿高丘的一端 恰好从我门前经过 那是在... 松酒巷
The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley. Gin Alley.

钢铁街 整天与你的盔甲和骑士在一起?  噗
The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft.

你可在城镇最热闹的地方住过
You lived in the fancy part of town.

两个跳蚤窝出身的男孩身处于国王的城堡之中

是啊 我们走了好长一段路

你忘了提利昂

你不是真的还要留任御林铁卫吧
You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?

留任御林铁卫意味着我能留在红堡 跟你在一起

现在不行  那什么时候  我回来好几周了

既然他现在还没回来  那就是回不来了
If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

那你想干什么
And what is it you want?

带这么点人攻打黑城堡吗
March on Castle Black with just this lot?

你那只漂亮乌鸦说那儿驻扎有一千人
Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.

他撒谎  以后别信他
Yeah, well, he's a liar.

他不应该是死了才对吗
Shouldn't it be 'he was'?

你说有三支箭射中了他
You said you put three arrows in him.

我见过你在二百码开外射中兔子的眼睛

如果那小子没死  只能是你故意放过他
If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.

我最他妈讨厌瑟恩人
I fucking hate Thenns.

你们从南边来  不是北边
You came from the south, not the north.

在那边的村子里搞到了晚饭
Got some supper from a village down that way.

为什么这边的肉吃起来 比我们长城那边好这么多
Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?

也许是这边的东西都喂得好
Maybe everything's just better fed down here.

你不知道我们要来
You didn't see us coming?

还有那个跟你们一起的乌鸦崽子 也不在了
And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?

曼斯问  我答
I'll answer to Mance.

你问  我不答
I won't answer to you.

不像黑城堡里那些乌鸦
Not like those crows at Castle Black.

想想他们窝在贮藏食物的地方 满嘴塞的都是火腿和血肠 还有炖肉  吃得白白胖胖 膘满肉肥
Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

我知道我们的口味不一样  托蒙德 但你至少在死之前 也该尝一次乌鸦肉嘛
I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.

我上次见他时 他在临冬城的院子里

他说  '下次再见 你就一身黑衣了'
He said, 'Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.'

父亲看他的那种目光
The way my father looked at him,

他什么都比我强 比武  打猎 骑马 还讨女孩子喜欢
He was better than me at everything fighting and hunting and riding and girls.

老天  姑娘们可喜欢他了

他们... 他们准备好召见你了
They're they're ready for you.

他早就想吊死我  现在有机会了
He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.

没人要绞死你  你又没有错
No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.

我错得太多了
I've done plenty wrong.

你承认你谋杀了断掌科林
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

不是吗  你用剑 杀死了一位守夜人军团的弟兄
No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch.

你说这是什么行为
What do you call that?

他想让我杀死他
He wanted me to kill him.

叛国贼的野种
A bastard son of a traitor.

真是果不其然
What would you expect?

断掌认为阻止曼斯的唯一机会 就是我们派人打进他的军队内部
The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

别说得好像你很了解断掌一样
Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him.

那你就该知道他愿意为保护长城不惜一切
Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall.

自由民肯定会把他活煮了 但由我来杀他...
The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...

自由民  听听他说什么
The free folk? Listen to him.

他说话都像个野人了
He even talks like a wildling now.

对  我像野人一样说话  跟野人一起吃饭
Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings.

跟野人一起爬上长城  我...
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I

我还睡了一个野人姑娘
I laid with a wildling girl.

那你承认你违背了誓言
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

法律就是法律  这小子必须死
The law is the law. The boy must die.

要是我们把每个睡过姑娘的游骑兵都砍头 长城就得靠无头弟兄来守卫了
If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.

偷偷溜进鼹鼠村的妓院 与跟敌人睡觉是有区别的
There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.

我们坐在这儿 为我坏了哪条规矩争论时
While we sit here debating which rules I broke,

曼斯・雷德正带领十万大军向长城开进
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.

不等你把五十个野人凑在一起 他们就开始自相残杀了
You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.

是十万  他联合了瑟恩人 硬足部落  冰川部落
100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the iceriver clans.

还有巨人为他而战
He has giants fighting for him.

你去过长城以外吗  爵士先生
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

我指挥过君临的都城守备队  小子
I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.

想必是指挥得不怎么样
You must not have been very good at your job.

有一队野人已经攻进长城以南了 由巨人克星托蒙德率领
There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane.

我杀了他们的易形者和另外三人
I killed their warg and three others.

他们射了我满身箭
They shot me full of arrows.

他们奉命在曼斯从北边进攻时 从南面攻击黑城堡
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north.

以篝火作为攻击信号
The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.

曼斯说那将是北境世所未见的大火
Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen.

你们是要处决我  还是放我自由离开
Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

我们是守夜人的汉子
We are men of the Night's Watch.

但我们今日不取你的脑袋  琼恩・雪诺
But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow.

现在我是代理总司令  伊蒙学士
I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

我不相信那个野种说的话
And I don't trust the bastard.

每次有人说谎你都能识破吗
And you always know when a man's telling a lie?

你这神奇的能力从何而来
How did you acquire this magical power?

因为我在君临长大
I grew up in King's Landing.

你是王后  不是公牛
You're a queen, not an ox.

你祖父送了我一条项链  跟这条一模一样 作为我第五十一个命名日的礼物
Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.

Nonsense. My little dears.

去找君临的宝石匠

报出你们的身份  你们主子的身份
Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you.

谁给我带回的项链最好 第二好的项链就归她
The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.

两周后要步入大教堂的玛格丽・提利尔 必将有千支歌谣为她传唱
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs.

如果她戴着那样的破烂  该是多么悲哀呀
Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.

也许我应该让乔佛里替我挑
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me.

最后脖子上围一串死麻雀的脑袋
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

讲话要注意  即使是在这儿跟我说
You watch that. Even here, even with me.

请原谅我贸然打扰二位
Please pardon me for interrupting.

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

我们知道你是谁  我们都听说过你
We know who you are. We've heard all about you.

I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.

我向诸神发誓  是史坦尼斯干的

他一剑刺穿蓝礼的心脏 随即消失得无影无踪
He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared.

They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

如今这支曾经是奴隶的军队 正向弥林的大门开进
And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates.

你觉得伟主会担心吗
You think the Great Masters are worried?

如果他们够聪明的话  陛下
If they're smart, Your Grace.

我不是要你骑马跟在队伍最后吗
You were told to ride at the back of the train.

但我有要事禀报

Everyone in Meereen knows that.

特别是泡茶的奴隶
Especially the slaves who have to make the tea.

如果您希望他们追随您 就要融进他们的世界
If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world.

千万别用来泡茶
No tea from this one.

美丽但是有毒
Beautiful but poisonous.

你还真是个赌徒
You are a gambler, aren't you?

从此处到弥林  每隔一里就有个这样的路标

这里离弥林还有多少里
How many miles are there between here and Meereen?

我派人先行一步  把他们埋了

您不需要看到这个

不准
You will do no such thing.

我要看清他们每一个人的脸
I will see each and every one of their faces.

埋她之前先把项圈拿掉

然后呢  你答应过

把史塔克家的女孩送回母亲身边 可母亲已经死了

死了就绝对安全了  你说呢
There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say?

而珊莎・史塔克如今成了珊莎・兰尼斯特
And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.

这就有点复杂了
Bit of a complication.

再怎么复杂  你也不能违背誓言
A complication does not release you from a vow.

你要我怎么做  绑架我的弟媳吗
What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sisterinlaw?

绑到哪儿去  她在哪儿能比在这里更安全

看着我的眼睛告诉我 你觉得她在君临会很安全
Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.

你真的不是我的亲戚吗
Are you sure we're not related?

自打我回来  见到的每个兰尼斯特 都要跟我过不去
Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass.

说不定你也是个兰尼斯特
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

你有兰尼斯特的发色  模样倒不像
You've got the hair for it if not the looks.

别怕  别怕
It's all right. It's all right.

我虽是弄臣  但多亏您  我保住了性命
I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

换了别人也会这么做的
Anyone would have done the same.

您的大恩大德  我永世难报
I can never repay you.

但这个  比我的生命更重要
But this, this is worth more than my life.

这是我祖母传给母亲  母亲又传给我的遗物
It belonged to my mother and her mother before her.

霍拉德家族曾显赫一时
House Hollard was strong once.

那段辉煌岁月只留下这唯一的纪念 因为出了几个我这样没出息的胖酒鬼
That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

你真好  但我不能接受
It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.

我现在一无所有
I don't have anything else left.

让我的姓氏在从世间消失之前 再沐浴一次阳光

Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse?

眼睁睁看着我唯一的财产跑掉
Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?

你怎么会没钱
Why don't you have any money?

你走之前没从乔佛里那儿偷点东西吗
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?

你脑子不大好使啊
You're not very smart, are you?

你杀小孩子眼都不眨 还鄙视偷盗
You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?

做男人要有原则
A man's got to have a code.

你以为我会跑吗
You think I'm gonna escape?

没了你  我活不到天黑
I'd be dead by nightfall without you.

我的家人都死了  没有亲人了
My family's gone. I've got no one.

你在艾林谷还有个姨妈
You've got an aunt in the Vale.

等我把你卖给她后 她没准还有足够的钱 给你买一匹念念不忘的小马
After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.

我饿了  你也饿了
I'm hungry. You're hungry.

五匹马  五个人
Five horses, five men.

我可不想饿着肚子杀这么多人
More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.

小个子  他叫波利佛

闭嘴  给我们再添些麦酒 说不定等我们玩完就不带她走了

给我们的新朋友倒酒
Pour our new friend some ale.

你怎么往北边来了
What brings you so far north?

我还没问你呢
I could ask the same of you.

你在这里做什么
What are you doing up here?

保护王国的安全

一天到晚拿着锤子敲人 感觉自个儿成了造椅子的木匠
You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs.

完全没有乐趣了
Drains the fun right out of it.

没乐子怎么过日子
And what's life without a little fun?

这话不用我给你讲
But I don't need to tell you that, eh?

她就这样  我手里有过更好的
She's all right. I've had better.

你应该跟我们一道
You should come with us.

这种人  通常都在哪儿藏点东西
His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere.

金子  银子  还有闺女
Gold, silver, more daughters.

只要你懂怎么撬开他们的嘴  就有好处拿
Always something if you know how to make them talk.

从这儿到君临  他这种货色多着呢
And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing.

你能赚好一大笔
You could do well for yourself.

我们收获就很不错
We certainly have been.

我不去君临
I'm not going to King's Landing.

考虑一下吧  我们想干什么想去哪里 全凭我们高兴
Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go.

这是国王的颜色
These are the king's colors.

如今没人敢挡他的路

我听说黑水河之战中 乔佛里的狗儿夹着尾巴跑了

我很清楚  如果你这张臭嘴 再蹦几个字出来
I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth,

我就要吃光这房子里所有的鸡了
I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.

你这辈子都为国王卖命
You lived your life for the king.

如今打算为了几只鸡送命
You're gonna die for some chickens?

小鬼  你的腿怎么了
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

什么  你什么意思
What? What do you mean?

能走路吗  要我背你吗
Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

可以给我剔剔牙缝
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it

我看不到她的身影了 拉姆斯
I can't see her, Ramsay.

如果能逃出这片树林 就算你赢了!

她以为她很漂亮

让我射在她脸上吧
Let me put one through her face.

我们得犒劳下猎狗们 亲爱的

钢镀金而已 你怎么也不吃东西
Gilded steel. You're not eating.

怎么都没有人吃东西呢?
Why is no one eating?

我老婆日渐消瘦 我哥也在绝食

Let others do the fight.

你能记得父亲上次拔剑是什么时候?

我不是咱们身为国王之手的父亲 我是弑君者

要是人们发现我连只鸽子都弑不掉…
When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...

那就训练啊 练习用另一只手去作战
Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.

跟谁? 你吗? 人们会说三道四的
With whom? You? Men talk.

一旦有人察觉到我已经不能作战 就会人尽皆知
Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.

And if I fight with an edged blade,

可就没人付我工钱了
I'll have no one left to pay me.

我九岁起就没使过练习用的钝剑了
I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.

像你这样英勇的战士 应该不会在对方毫无防备的时候偷袭吧
Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.

那可是袭击的最好时机

让我看看他
I'll have a look at him.

我听说你砍下了弑君者的一只手臂

我想拿他来换取卡林湾的控制权

葛雷乔伊大人拒绝了我 野蛮人就是没有…

你未经我同意就去与巴隆・葛雷乔伊谈条件?

是您让我当恐怖堡代理城主的

我回自己家还得走小道 还不是那些葛雷乔伊家族的人害的
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys.

臭佬永远不会背叛我们
Reek will never betray us.

我对你太过信任了
I placed far too much trust in you.

臭佬 你怎么能让我满脸胡茬就来见我父亲?
Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven?

这太失礼了 抱歉 大人
It's disrespectful. I'm sorry, my lord.

我不姓波顿 父亲 这又有什么关系?
I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?

臭佬 告诉我父亲 布兰跟瑞肯・史塔克到哪里去啦?
Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

我不知道 大人
I don't know, my lord.

你杀害了他们 然后将他们的尸体吊在临冬城城头
You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

臭佬 是你杀了史塔克家的儿子吗?
Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?

但尸体已被烧变形 死无对证

The Starks have always ruled the North.

只要布兰和瑞肯还活着 整个北境都会听其号令 现在罗柏・史塔克已死
If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.

哦 对了 臭佬
Oh, that's right, Reek.

你想证明你是个波顿? 
You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

带你的全部人马向卡林湾进发

带上你的这个东西
Bring this creature of yours.

So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.

我父亲会问你还有没有其他的事情发生 而你会告诉他一个机智的谎言
My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.

你想想如果你父亲和你姐怀疑我撒谎 我还有多少日子可活
How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying?

我可没有如影随行的佣兵保护
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.

也没有传奇般的兄长替我复仇

我只有在耳边低语的小小鸟们
Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

没人为蜘蛛或妓女哭泣

吾主带走了他们 你看到了吗
Our lord took them. Did you see?

佛罗伦大人是您的内兄
Lord Florent was your brother by law.

他膜拜他父辈的神灵 以及父辈的父辈
He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him.

那些也是您父辈的神灵
They were the gods of your fathers, too.

我命令他推倒他的神像
I ordered him to tear down his idols.

他将多少艘战船带到您的麾下? 
How many ships did he bring to your cause?

比你多不少
A good deal more than you.

你看见了吗 戴佛斯爵士
Did you see, Ser Davos?

他们现在与吾主同在
They're with our lord now.

他们的罪孽已经全部化作灰烬 你看见了吗
Their sins all burned away. Did you see?

我相信他们一定感激涕零 王后殿下
I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.

我们贮藏室几乎空了
Our larders are almost empty.

那就吃鱼 我们在一座岛上
Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

我讨厌的东西多了 还不是一样要忍受
I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.

当风息堡被围攻时 我深受饥饿之苦
When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving,

史坦尼斯用书为我熬汤
Stannis boiled soup for me from books.

粘书的胶是从马身上来的
The binding glue is made from horses.

一天早上 他在沙滩上射中两只海鸥
One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach.

我再未品尝过任何比烤海鸥更美味的食物了
I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.

你还记得吗?  我当然记得
Do you remember? Of course I remember.

你是否知道真正的饥饿 夫人
Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

当我还是个孩子 这是我唯一知道的事
It's all I knew when I was a child.

直到你发现了光之王? 
Until you found the Lord of Light?

我担心我们女儿的灵魂
I fear for our daughter's soul.

每个母亲都有理由担心自己孩子的灵魂
Every mother should fear for her child's soul.

她是个倔强的野兽 她是个孩子
She's a stubborn little beast. She's a child.

你觉得她可爱是因为她只拿笑脸对着你
You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit.

她阴沉 固执 罪孽深重
She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.

否则为何光之王在她的脸上打上烙印? 
Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face?

她是我的女儿 你不能打她
She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

也许梅丽珊卓女士可以和她谈谈
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.

你在睡觉吗 公主?
Were you sleeping, Princess?

你看到了沙滩上的仪式了吗? 
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

And it frightened you?

亚赛尔爵士是我舅舅

他总是对我很友好
He was always kind to me.

他们现在去了更好的地方 公主
They're in a better place now, Princess.

火焰净化他们世间的罪恶
The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.

女人在生孩子的时候也尖叫
Women scream when they give birth.

之后却满心欢喜
Afterward they are filled with joy.

之后他们不是灰烬和骨头
Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

你总是满腹疑惑 不是吗?
You have so many questions, don't you?

我小时候也是
So did I when I was a child.

不过我却不是公主
Only I wasn't a princess.

你也没有这个
And you didn't have this.

但是我忍受的是另一种苦 小可爱 相信我
But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me.

关于神你知道多少
What do you know of the gods?

我读过《七星圣经》
I read 'The SevenPointed Star.'

主教们宣讲七神
Septons speak of seven gods.

但神只有两位 - 一位带来爱和欢乐的光之神 以及一位带来邪恶和恐惧的黑暗之神
There are but two― a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.

所以也没有七神天堂和七重地狱? 
There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?

只有一个地狱 公主
There's only one hell, Princess.

我们正生活在其中
The one we live in now.

你都'去'了好几个小时了
You've been gone for hours.

你自己是不能靠狼吃的东西过活的
Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes.

附在夏天身上这么久很危险

你不是冰原狼 布兰
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

不过肯定很棒
Must be glorious, though.

能跑 能跳 能猎食
To run, to leap, to hunt.

我知道那很诱人 但是如果你附在夏天身体里太久了 你会忘了你是人
I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.

你会忘了我们的 布兰
You'd forget us, Bran.

你会忘了你的母亲父亲
You'd forget your mother and father.

忘了你的兄弟姐妹
You'd forget your brothers and sisters.

忘了临冬城
You'd forget Winterfell.

我们一旦失去你 就失去了一切
And if we lose you, we lose everything.

阿多 带我去那棵树那儿
Hodor, take me to the tree.

我知道我们该去哪儿了
I know where we have to go.

我庄严宣布 提利尔家族的玛格丽 与兰尼斯特和拜拉席恩家族的乔佛里结为夫妻 从今以后 他们就是一个心灵 一个躯体 一个魂魄 直到永远
Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul.

奥柏伦 将受到无情的诅咒
'红毒蛇' 多恩亲王 who would seek to tear them asunder.

经由这一吻 献出我的爱
With this kiss, I pledge my love.

有点过了 你觉得呢?  很相称
Bit much, wouldn't you say? It feels proportionate.

与什么相称?  预料中的奢侈
Proportionate to what? The expected extravagance.

为此种荒谬行为买单的人 可不希望婚礼持续得太久
People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.

你可得在死之前试着享受点什么
You ought to try enjoying something before you die.

你可能会发现还挺不错的
You might find it suits you.

现在不行 梅斯 泰温大人跟我在说话呢
Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

总之 我不知道你在抱怨个啥
Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about.

我们是不是应该把一半的肉派粘上金玫瑰 来表彰您的慷慨? 
Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?

不 你真心的感谢也就足够了
No, your heartfelt thankyou is its own reward.

我猜不久我就会再次听到你的感谢
I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long.

打仗可是很贵的
Wars are rather expensive.

它们喜欢提醒大家
How they love to remind everyone.

就像你们兰尼斯特号称有债必偿一样
Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.

我可不担心铁金库
I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

我们都知道你有的是办法
We both know you're smarter than that.

来吧 泰温 让我们庆祝年轻人的爱情
Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.

你看见她登船了?  对 她在上面
You saw her board the ship? Aye, she's on it.

你看见船起航了? 
You saw the ship sail away?

没人知道她在上面 除了你 我 和瓦里斯
No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.

因为如果有人跟踪我
Because if someone follows me without an invitation,

那就是他们最后一次跟踪别人了
I'm the last person they ever follow.

I know you don't want to believe it, but she is.

好了 去喝几口你就没事了
Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.

你看起来格外优雅迷人 孩子
You look exquisite, child.

美中不足的是 风稍稍乱了头发
The wind has been at you, though.

一直没有机会告诉你 对你哥哥的事情我非常遗憾
I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother.

战争是战争 但是在婚礼上杀人 太恐怖了
War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid.

什么样的怪物才能干出这种事情来? 
What sort of monster would do such a thing?

好像男人对婚姻还不够恐惧似的
As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.

你看 嫁给提利昂大人 也没有那么糟糕
Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that.

如果嫁给一个穷光蛋 也许他要卖掉骡子或者最后一双鞋 才能带你去高庭逛一圈
Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.

现在和平已经到来 世界也都恢复正常了 到处看看对你也会有好处的
Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it.

请原谅 我也得去吃点东西了 我可是掏过钱的
You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.

够了 够了 快滚吧
Very good. Very good. Off you go.

亲爱的 不如我们来宣布吧? 
My love, why don't we make the announcement?

王后有几句话要说
The queen would like to say a few words.

我们如此幸运 享受此等的美食美酒
We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink.

但是并不是所有人都如我们这般幸运
Not all among us are so lucky.

为感谢诸神保佑战争即将结束
To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end,

乔佛里国王下令将我们婚宴剩下的食物 送给他都城里面的穷人
King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.

洛拉斯爵士 没关系
Ser Loras, it's quite all right.

你妹妹看起来非常漂亮
Your sister looks very beautiful.

这么说 很期待你的婚礼? 
So, looking forward to your wedding?

你我的父亲对两家联姻都非常看好
Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.

也许倒是该他们俩结婚
Perhaps they should get married.

你要是娶瑟曦 她会在你睡觉时杀了你的
If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep.

你要是莫名其妙地让她怀上孩子 她会在孩子有第一次呼吸之前 连孩子也一起杀了
If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath.

对你来说幸运的是 这些都不会发生 因为你永远不会娶她
Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.

而你也不会
And neither will you.

王后 布蕾妮小姐
My queen. Lady Brienne.

真高兴你能来
So good of you to come.

我可不是什么小姐 王后
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

请太后恕罪
Apologies, Your Grace.

我一直都没学会屈膝礼
I never did master the curtsy.

就是你捅了蓝礼・拜拉席恩一剑
You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.

不是那样的 亲爱的 布蕾妮与此事毫无关系
That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.

谁宰了这变态叛徒 我还想封他个骑士做做
I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.

我只是想恭喜两位 祝你们幸福
I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune.

这个国家战乱太久了
The country has been at war too long.

我希望你们的结合能够带来长久和平
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

我希望能再见到你
I hope we see more of you.

你是塞尔温・塔斯大人的女儿
You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.

因此不管愿意与否 你就是一位小姐
That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.

你说是就是 太后
As you say, Your Grace.

我向你表示感谢
I owe you my gratitude.

你把我弟弟安全地带回了君临
You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.

其实 是他救了我 太后
In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.

他都没跟我讲过
Haven't heard that story before.

恐怕 并不是什么光彩的故事
Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.

我相信你有很多光彩的故事
I'm sure you have many fascinating stories.

向蓝礼・拜拉席恩效忠 向凯特琳・史塔克效忠 现在又向我弟弟效忠
Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

一定很刺激吧 从一个阵营转投到另一个 喜欢谁就效忠谁
Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

我并不效忠于你的弟弟 太后
I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

不不不 到我的房间来 我会亲自给你做检查
No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.

她不会去的 哦 太后
She'll do no such thing. Oh, Your Grace.

嗯 这位年轻的小姐来找我咨询 -
Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice―

你应该去找科本 他很不错
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

陛下 科本? 恶心货
Your Grace. Qyburn? Deplorable man.

他那些令人作呕的实验丢尽了学城的脸
Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.

比你用皱巴巴的手去摸那个小姑娘的大腿还恶心? 
More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

太后 我可是个学士
Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

得罪我小弟的时候他把你扔进了黑牢
My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

你觉得得罪我会怎么样? 
What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?

我从来不想得罪谁
I never meant to annoy anyone.

但你得罪我了 你现在就得罪我了
But you are. You annoy me right now.

你在这喘口气都是得罪我
Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me.

所以你给我听好了
So here's what I want you to do.

从我眼前消失
I want you to leave my presence.

你现在就从这婚礼上滚蛋
Leave this wedding right now.

滚到厨房去 并且告诉他们 所有的剩饭剩菜都给我喂狗
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.

太后 玛格丽王后 …
Your Grace, Queen Margaery--

太后正在命令你 所有的剩菜剩饭统统喂狗 否则就把你喂狗
The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.

谁能把弄臣的帽子打下来 赏一个金龙
A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

你心情不错啊
You're in rather a good mood.

我想是的 不言自明
I suppose I am. I won't ask why.

小小乐趣罢了 陛下 泰温大人
Small pleasures. Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

我想你们还没见过艾拉莉亚
I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

这位是首相泰温・兰尼斯特大人 和摄政太后瑟曦・兰尼斯特
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent.

我想现在应该是前摄政太后了
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

首相大人和瑟曦夫人
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

艾拉莉亚・沙德 大人 夫人
Ellaria Sand. My lord. My lady.

我还从没见过姓沙德的人呢
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

在多恩 我们无处不在
We are everywhere in Dorne.

我有成千上万兄弟姐妹
I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

私生子们都是激情的产物 不是吗
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

在多恩 我们从不轻视他们
We don't despise them in Dorne.

是吗? 你可真能忍啊
No? How tolerant of you.

我想您这下可轻松了吧 瑟曦夫人 从此就不必再摄政了
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities.

头戴王冠这么多年 您的脖子都被压歪了吧
Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.

这你就永远都不会懂了 奥柏伦亲王
I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.

你哥哥不能来参加婚礼 真是太可惜了
It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.

请替我们对他致以问候
Please give him our regards.

但愿他的痛风能减轻一点 没准他以后还能重新走路呢
With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.

人们都说这可是贵人病
They call it the rich man's disease.

真奇怪您怎么没得呢
A wonder you don't have it.

在我们这地方 贵族们的生活方式可跟你们多恩不一样
Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.

各地的人们自有不同
People everywhere have their differences.

有些地方贵族们对贫民嗤之以鼻
In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

而有些地方 强奸杀害妇女和婴儿 才遭人鄙视
In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful.

您可真幸运啊 前 摄政太后 您的女儿弥赛拉被送往的 是后一类地方
What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.

大家安静! 清出场地
Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.

今天我们的娱乐活动太多了
There's been too much amusement here today.

但是王家婚礼不是玩乐
A royal wedding is not an amusement.

王家婚礼是一段历史
A royal wedding is history.

现在该我们 回顾历史了
The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history.

大人们… 女士们…
My lords...  my ladies...

罗柏・史塔克 巴隆・葛雷乔伊
Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy.

五王之战
The War of the Five Kings.

我才是合法的国王
I'm the rightful king.

北境之王! 没错!
King in the North! Yes!

叛徒 你这个叛国贼
Traitor. You're a traitor.

为了七国!
For the Seven Kingdoms!

蓝礼 你才不是国王呢
Renly, you're no king.

滚开 变态 滚开 滚开
Away, degenerate. Away. Away.

继续 我封你做亲王
Go on. I want you to be my prince.

现在看谁得到金子了 史塔克? 
Who's got the gold now, Stark?

我才是合法的国王 来挑战我啊 无赖
I am the rightful king. Challenge me, ruffian.

吃我一剑 我要淹死了 我要淹死了
Take that. I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

我是北境之王!
I am the King in the North!

散场之后给他们每人 20 金龙
Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

我们还得想想怎么感谢国王才是
We'll have to find another way to thank the king.

我是北境之王!
I am the King in the North!

打得好 打得好
Well fought. Well fought.

赏你的 冠军的赏钱
Here you are. Champion's purse.

尽管你还不是冠军呢 不是吗? 
Though you're not the champion yet, are you?

真正的冠军可击败一切挑战
A true champion defeats all the challengers.

毫无疑问还有其他人 胆敢挑战我的统治
Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign.

要不你上? 我肯定他们有备用服装
How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.

我已经尝够了战斗的滋味 陛下
One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace.

我的脸上已经不需要再添疤痕了
I would like to keep what remains of my face.

我倒觉得该您上
I think you should fight him.

这场表演完全就是对 您在战场上英勇形象的拙劣模仿
This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle.

作为第一见证人 我为您不平
I speak as a firsthand witness.

从高台上爬下去 拿着您的新瓦雷利亚宝剑 让大家看看 真正的国王是怎样赢得他的王位的
Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne.

这人明显已经被情欲逼疯了
This one is clearly mad with lust.

要是国王在大婚前就失身 那就太悲剧了
It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.

洒出来真是糟蹋了
Shame that it spilled.

亲爱的 回来吧
My love, come back to me.

该我父亲祝酒了
It's time for my father's toast.

我杯中无酒 他怎么祝酒? 
Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine?

舅舅 既然你懦弱到不敢战斗的话 来做我的侍酒吧
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

谢陛下给我这莫大的荣誉
Your Grace does me a great honor.

这不是荣誉
It's not meant as an honor.

我要个空杯子干嘛? 
What good is an empty cup?

跪在你的国王面前
Kneel before your king.

我们能走了吗?  我们试试看
Can we leave now? Let's find out.

你是我的侍酒 记得吗? 
You're my cupbearer, remember?

我想我得把这些湿衣服换下来 陛下
I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.

不不不 我看你这样就挺好
No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are.

给我斟酒 快点 这派很干 不错
Serve me my wine.  hurry up. This pie is dry.  good.

见谅 陛下 珊莎夫人已经累了
If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.

不行 你在这儿等着…
No, you'll wait here...

他噎住了! 帮帮那可怜的孩子
He's choking! Help the poor boy.

白痴 帮帮你们的国王 滚开!
Idiots, help your king. Move away!

乔佛里! 乔佛里! 帮帮他!
Joffrey! Joffrey! Help him!

来人帮帮他! 乔佛里!
Someone help him! Joffrey!

跟我来 乔佛里! 乔佛里!
Come with me now. Joffrey! Joffrey!

想活命的话 我们必须走了
If you want to live, we have to leave.

他走了 我们国王走了
He's gone. Our king is gone.

他毒死了我儿子 你们的国王
He poisoned my son, your king.

爪牙锋利不留情
A lion still has claws

汝子莫忘记
As long and sharp as yours

他这样说 他这样说
And so he spoke and so he spoke

卡斯特梅的爵爷他这样说
That Lord of Castamere

内里却无人影
With no one there to hear

内里却无魂灵
And not a soul to hear

是你干的 是你干的!
You did this.You did this!

我们必须走了 抓住他! 抓住他!
We have to leave.  Take him! Take him!

找到她 封锁城门
Find her.Bar the gates of the city.

拦住港口里每一艘船
Seize every ship in the harbor.

她在哪儿? ! 禁止任何人离开首都!
Where is she?!  No one leaves the capital!

上来 我们要去哪儿? 
Get in.  Where are we going?

你比你想象的更坚强
You're stronger than you know.

贝里席大人?  培提尔
Lord Baelish?  Petyr.

你没受伤吧 小姐? 
Are you hurt, my lady?

我知道你一定吓坏了 不过放心
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.Rest easy.

最难熬的时光已经过去了 贝里席大人
The worst is past.  Lord Baelish.

我保证过会把她安全带到这里 安静一点 朋友
I promised I'd get her to you safely.  Softly, my friend.

声音在水上传的很远
Voices carry over water.

我必须在有人注意到之前赶回去
I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.

但首先你想拿到报酬
First you'll want your pay.

一万金龙 对么?  一万金龙
10,000 was it?  10,000.

你可不想被太后听到吧? 
You don't want the queen to hear, do you?

上千金袍子正在四处搜索你的下落
1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you.

要是被他们逮到了 你觉得他们会怎样惩罚谋杀国王的女孩? 
And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?

我没有谋杀任何人 我知道 我知道
I didn't murder anyone.  I know. I know.

但你不得不承认你的嫌疑很大
But you must admit it looks suspicious.

国王处决了你的父亲 还折磨了你这么多年 而你在他被谋杀后逃走了
The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.

你为什么要杀他? 
Why did you kill him?

因为他酗酒成性 还愚不可及 而我信不过愚蠢的酒鬼
Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.

救了你? 小姐 他只是听我的命令行事
Saved you? My lady,he followed my orders.

他们全都一样 他这么做只是为了金子
Every one of them.And he did it all for gold.

一袋金龙买得一时安全
Money buys a man's silence for a time.

一支好箭可保一世平安
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

他帮我是因为我救了他的命
He was helping me because I saved his life.

是啊 他还给了你一条珍贵的项链 说是他祖母的
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother.

还是霍拉德家族最后的遗物
The last legacy of House Hollard.

实际上是我几周前找人做的
I had it made a few weeks ago.

还记得关于都城我说过什么吗? 
What did I once tell you about the capital?

我们都是骗子
We're all liars here.

我知道这一天对你来说很艰难
I know you've had a difficult day.

你在我身边很安全 和我一起回家吧
You're safe with me and sailing home.

跟蓝礼那时候比当然是
More than you were with Renly.

奥莲娜·雷德温
'荆棘女王'  玛格丽·提利尔的祖母

但假如乔佛里在死前已经跟你圆房了 会更名正言顺
Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying.

但是现在 不是讨论这个问题的时候
In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.

他抓着自己的喉咙 乞求着母亲能救救自己…  这太恐怖了
Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stopit was horrible.

这世上恐怖的事情太多了
The world is overflowing with horrible things.

但比起死亡都不算什么
But they're all a tray of cakes next to death.

你知道么? 你爷爷去世后 他们把我带到他的尸体前
They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know?

他们把我带到大厅里 他就在那儿
They took me to the Great Hall and there he was.

我的丈夫 让我承受生子之痛的人
The man I'd married and suffered to father my children.

让我在冗长的晚宴和乏味的聚会里 枯坐在旁边的那具皮囊
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

他就在那儿… 躺在台上
There he was...  lying on a table.

我的一个丈夫喜欢男人的陪伴 他被利刃穿心而死
One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart.

另一个则热衷于折磨小动物 结果在我们的婚宴上被毒杀
Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

我一定是被诅咒了 胡扯
I must be cursed.  Nonsense.

你的处境已经好很多了
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

也许眼睁睁看着他死去并不好受 但我敢说 要比嫁给他好得多
You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him,I can promise you that.

但我本该成为王后
But I would have been the queen.

我们和兰尼斯特的联盟 对我们来说有多么不愉快 对他们来说就有多么重要
Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us.

乔佛里的事你做的很好
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

下一个应该会容易许多
The next one should be easier.

你的哥哥死了
Your brother is dead.

你知道这意味着什么吗? 
Do you know what that means?

我可不是在哄你
I'm not trying to trick you.

这意味着我将成为国王
It means I'll become king.

是的 你将成为国王
Yes, you will become king.

你觉得你会成为一位怎样的国王? 
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

嗯 我也这么想
Mm, I think so as well.

你有成为好国王的气质
You've got the right temperament for it.

但怎样才能做个好国王? 嗯? 
But what makes a good king? Hmm?

要做一位好国王 最重要的那个品质是什么? 
What is a good king's single most important quality?

一定要在这里谈吗

你这么一位用毒专家来到首都 几天后我外孙便死于中毒

They didn't find the candles, though.

一个羽毛笔 几卷羊皮纸 鸭肉香肠 杏仁 还有点硬奶酪
A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.

什么都没听说 大人
I've heard nothing, my lord.

那这就是好消息
I suppose that's a good thing.

他们在外面是怎么说我的
What are they saying about me out there?

两星期后你会以谋杀国王的罪名 接受审判
You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.

你相信是我杀了乔佛里吗? 
Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?

虽然这世界没了他会更好 但我什么都没做
The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it.

我觉得 如果是我策划这起皇室谋杀
I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination,

我才不会安排自己站在那儿 像个傻子一样看着国王死掉
I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died.

审判将在两星期后举行
Trial in a fortnight.

他们公布法官是谁了吗? 
Have they announced the judges yet?

有您父亲 当然了
Your father. Of course.

那家伙只会按我父亲的意思来
Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.

以及多恩的奥伯伦亲王
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

真服了我父亲
Give it to my father.

就算是家族悲剧他也没忘了从中渔利
He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.

您得给我个名单 大人
I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord.

列出肯为您作证的人
Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

噢 我可以联系自己的证人吗? 
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

瞧他们多慷慨
How generous of them.

那好吧 我老婆 珊莎
Very well, my wife. Sansa.

不见了?  婚礼之后就没人再见过她了
Gone? No one's seen her since the wedding.

您觉得会不会是她...
You don't think she...

没有人比珊莎有更多的动机要杀乔佛里了 但刺客并不是她
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin.

不管是谁杀了国王 他都想让我用脑袋为他买单
Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it.

而老婆一失踪 我看上去就更加有罪了
And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty.

波德瑞克 在 大人? 
Podrick. Yes, my lord?

他们现在该找上你了 谁? 
They'll be following you now. Who will?

我不知道是谁 就是他们 他们那些坏家伙
I don't know. They. They. The ominous they.

那些想置我于死地的男人 女人们 我父亲
The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father.

也许乔佛里对他们来说太麻烦了
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.

乖巧的托曼更方便操纵
Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.

每当不幸的事情降临在我头上
Whenever something bad happens to me,

我猜都有我姐姐的份
I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.

但不管怎么说 瑟曦爱她的孩子们
But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children.

她是唯一一个我确定与这起谋杀毫无瓜葛的人
She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder.

真是稀罕 明明君临所有的谋杀案她都有份
Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.

还有其他证人吗 大人? 
Any other witnesses, my lord?

瓦里斯要有那个胆 也许能为我作证
Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

他已经受召成为王后方的证人了
He's already been called as a witness for the queen.

果然如此 去找波隆 我有活要交给他
Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.

我已经去过了 大人
I've already asked, my lord.

他们不让他见您 为什么? 
They won't let him see you. Why not?

他们说他是个臭名昭著的杀手 是您的狗腿子
They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.

他自身难保
He's under investigation himself.

我哥哥呢? 他们至少会允许我见詹姆吧? 
And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

还有些事 大人
There's something else, my lord.

有个人 我没看清他的长相 他来问我能否指证您
A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you.

说只要我告诉法官 你之前购买过一种叫扼死者的毒药 就封我为波德瑞克·派恩爵士
Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.

听起来不错 你怎么回答的? 
Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?

我什么都没说 大人
I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

你要接受他们的条件吗? 
Are you going to accept their offer?

要你指证我可不仅仅是什么建议
Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.

如果他们用胡萝卜吸引不了你 就该换大棒了
If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.

你一向待我不薄 大人
You've been good to me, my lord.

波德 审判在两周之后举行
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

他们要在那之前得到答复
They'll want an answer before that.

我已经给了他们答复 大人
I already gave them an answer, my lord.

我不要你为我而死
I will not have you dying on my behalf.

听见没有? 如果我不得不 经过重重审判 然后去刑场挨上一刀
Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block,

我不想看到你的脑袋已经早早挂在上面了
I don't want to see your head already mounted.

大人 波德 我命令你
My lord. Pod, I am giving you an order.

去找我哥哥 告诉他我需要他
Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him.

然后赶紧离开君临 趁现在还不晚
And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late.

再没有比你更忠心的侍从了
There has never lived a more loyal squire.

妈妈说该吃饭了
Mother says it's time to eat.

她煮了什么? 等等 等等 让我猜一猜
What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

嗯 没人比你妈妈更会煮土豆了
Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom.

耶哥蕊特
'火吻而生' 野人

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人

你知道怎么去黑城堡吗? 
You know how to get to Castle Black?

我要吃了他们
I'm going to eat them.

我要吃了你死去的妈妈 再吃了你死去的爸爸
I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa.

去给黑城堡里的乌鸦们报信儿吧
Go tell the crows at Castle Black.

我们得让这些食人生番尝尝教训
We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.

割了他们的喉咙 把他们的尸体 从长城上扔下去
Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall.

这样应该能让他们长点记性 是啊!
Seems like that would be a good lesson. Aye!

如果我们出去追击 就正中他们下怀了
If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want.

他们想把我们引出去 然后各个击破
They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.

我们只有一百多人
We have just over 100 men.

这还包括了事务官和工匠
And that's including stewards and builders.

以及我这样的 我们一个人都损失不起
And me. We can't afford to lose a single man.

我们必须牢记自己的首要职责
We must remember our first responsibility.

我们是长城上的守卫
We are the watchers on the Wall.

总得想点办法保护他们的才对
There's got to be a way to protect them.

派普尔
'派普' 守夜人

你是平民的守护者 雪诺大人
You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow.

你对派普兄弟的建议有什么要说的吗? 
What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?

曼斯·雷德近在眼前
Mance Rayder is coming.

如果野人越过了长城 他们将席卷千里内的一切 直到遭遇能抵挡他们的军队为止
If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 miles before they reach an army that can stop them.

我们必须坚守黑城堡 我们必须守卫长城
We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall.

还以为你变成蓝眼尸鬼了呢
Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

你们怎么去了那么久
What took you so long?

我们被困住了 被什么? 
We were held up. By what?

我们被卡斯特堡垒里的叛乱者扣留了
We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.

艾迪森·托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

葛兰
'笨牛' 守夜人游骑兵

叛乱者还在那里?  他们哪也没去
And the mutineers stayed? They're not going anywhere.

他们抢了卡斯特的食物和老婆
They've got Craster's food and his wives.

真没想到 她们也会有想念父亲的时候
Never thought they'd miss their daddy.

卡尔现在成了他们的头
Karl's running things now.

就是他一刀捅进了卡斯特的嘴里
He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.

我们得向北去 杀了他们
We need to ride north and kill them all.

这事先放一放 小子
We just went over this, boy.

正义可以等 这与正义无关
Justice can wait. It's not about justice.

我告诉野人我们仅仅在黑城堡就有一千人
I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

但卡尔那伙人跟我们一样知道真相
Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do.

一旦野人开始严刑逼供 你觉得他们还能保密多久? 
How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off?

曼斯要击溃我们轻而易举 只是他还不知道而已
Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet.

一旦他抓到了他们就完了
As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will.

然后他就会对我们发动全面进攻
Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

即使我们每个人都能杀掉一百个野人 也依然完全无法抵挡他们前进的脚步
And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.

我可不觉得我能杀一百个野人
I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

弥林的勇士
A champion of Meereen.

他们要您派出自己的勇士与他决斗
They want you to send your own champion against him.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
'大熊' 女王铁卫

我觉得他是要...
I believe he means to...

他说我们的军队虽然由男人组成 却没有 男根
He says that we're an army of men without man parts.

还说您根本不是女人 而是个...  把老二藏在自己屁眼里的男人
He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who...  hides his cock in his own asshole.

不要管他 陛下 都是些废话
Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.

如果半个城的人都在听 就不是废话了
They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.

我有话要对弥林的人民说
I have something to say to the people of Meereen.

但首先 我要这家伙安静下来
First, I will need this one to be quiet.

可有勇士愿意迎战? 
Do I have a champion?

陛下 我赢过的单挑比世上的任何人都多
Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.

所以你必须留在我身边
Which is why you must remain by my side.

我比他们中任何一人服侍您的时间都长 卡丽熙
I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

今天也让我为您而战吧
Let me stand for you today as well.

你是我最信赖的谋臣 我最重要的将军 我最宝贵的朋友
You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend.

我不会拿你的性命作赌注
I will not gamble with your life.

我是最后一个加入您军队的
I was the last to join your army.

我不是什么将军或者女王铁卫 也不是无垢者的指挥官
I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied.

我母亲是个妓女 我生来一文不名
My mother was a whore. I come from nothing.

要不了多久 也会身归尘土
And before long, I will return to nothing.

让我为你宰了这家伙吧
Let me kill this man for you.

你的观众可不少
You have quite an audience.

要对得起他们
Make it worth their while.

他很英勇 陛下
He is very brave, Your Grace.

是啊 无论输赢 整个城市都看着呢
Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.

你真的不要匹马? 
You sure you don't want a horse?

为什么我需要马? 
Why would I want a horse?

马比人快得多
Horses are faster than men.

马比人笨得多
Horses are dumber than men.

我…叫… 灰…虫子
My name is Grey Worm.

我…来自… 盛夏…群'倒'
I come from the Summer 'Ills.'

我来自纳斯岛
I am from an island called Naath.

在我 5 岁的时候
I was five years old.

你还记得你的家乡? 
You remember your home?

我记得当运奴船把我们带走的时候
I remember when they rowed us away from shore.

沙滩多么的洁白
How white the beaches were.

我还记得我们村子被烧毁
And I remember my village burning.

烟尘直上云霄
Smoke rising into the sky.

你记得自己的家乡吗?
Do you remember your home?

之前 什么都记不得
Before Unsullied, nothing.

也许有一天你能回到盛夏群岛呢
Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.

通用语学的如何了?
How are the lessons coming?

很好 陛下
Very well, Your Grace.

弥桑黛是个老师好 女王陛下
Missandei is teacher good, my queen.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

看来你还得继续学习
You'll have to continue later.

母亲! 母亲! 母亲! 母亲!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

告诉我 乔拉爵士 伟主们在路标上钉了多少无辜孩童? 
Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?

陛下 我能跟您进言一句吗? 
Your Grace, may I have a word?

所有人 都是您的子民
All these people, they're your subjects now.

有时即使是对不义之行 也应该予以宽恕
Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.

我要用正义的手段惩戒不义之行
I will answer injustice with justice.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者'  御林铁卫队长

你这他妈是干嘛? 
What the hell was that?

我正在用你自己的手 把你打得屁滚尿流
That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.

不管怎么说 欺负残废
You're a rare talent.

你还真有天才
When you're fighting cripples, anyway.

你的剑法循规蹈矩
You learned to fight like a good little boy.

我敢说 你在疯王背后阴的那一下 姿势肯定很潇洒
I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.

可你到底是在耍帅还是杀人
You want to fight pretty or you want to win?

你跟我弟也都这么讲话? 
You talk to my brother this way?

你觉得是他干的吗? 
Do you think he did it?

噢 他当然讨厌那个小崽子
Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.

下毒不是他的风格
And poison's not his style.

就事论事的说 谋杀也不是
Or murder, for that matter.

你这么想知道 干嘛不自己问他? 
You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?

你不打算去见他 是吧? 
You haven't been to see him yet, eh?

今天先到此为止
We're done for today.

你老弟有没有告诉过你 我是怎么开始帮他干事的? 
Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?

在鹰巢城比武审判上 你替他出战
You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.

不过是因为艾林夫人下令 审判必须当天举行
But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.

他本来想选你的
You were his first choice.

他当时任命你为他的代理骑士 因为他知道 你会连夜骑马赶来 为他出战
He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.

这次你会为他出战吗? 
You gonna fight for him now?

跟你说实话 这还不算太差
To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad.

四面有墙 还有个夜壶
Four walls. A pot to piss in.

我当时被栓在一根木杆上几个月 都快被自己的屎给埋了
I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.

你在安慰我吗? 
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

我很抱歉 没能早点来
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

我懂 事态复杂
It's complicated, yes.

我们的老姐怎么样了?  你觉得呢? 
So how is our sister? How do you think?

她看着她儿子死在怀里
Her son died in her arms.

你知道接下来会怎样吗? 
You know what's coming?

审判我的弑君之罪 我知道
My trial for regicide. Yes, I know.

我知道他妈的整个国家都认定我有罪
I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty.

我还知道 三个法官其中一个 早就无数次诅咒我死去
I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count.

这个法官 还是我的亲生父亲
And that judge is my father.

至于瑟曦 嗯 她大概正努力寻找 不用审判也能直接让我死个透的方法
As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.

既然你自己提到了 她的确这么问过我
Now that you mention it, she did ask.

那我该乖乖转身闭上眼咯? 
So, should I turn around and close my eyes?

好一对弑君小兄弟
The Kingslayer brothers.

喜欢这称号吗? 我还挺喜欢的
You like it? I like it.

你是认真地在问我到底杀没杀你儿子? 
You're really asking if I killed your son?

你是认真地在问我到底会不会杀自己的弟弟? 
Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother?

这简单 放了我呗
Well, you could set me free.

那真就没什么好说的了
Then there's really nothing else to say.

你想我怎么办? 把守卫都杀了? 
What do you want me to do? Kill the guards?

把你藏在马车里 偷偷运出城? 
Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart?

我可是御林铁卫队长
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

抱歉 我忘了
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

御林铁卫做这种事不太妥当
I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.

你被控弑君 放你逃走是叛国罪
You're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason.

可是我啥都没做
Except I didn't do it.

所以我们才要举行审判
Which is why we're having a trial.

就算真凶自己跪到铁王座前 承认一切罪行 还呈上样样铁证 对瑟曦来说也没用
If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei.

不把我的脑袋插在枪尖上 她是不会罢休的
She won't rest until my head's on a spike.

任何人只要能找到珊莎・史塔克 她都承诺授予骑士爵位
She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

不可能是珊莎做的
Sansa couldn't have done this.

她比七国上下任何一个人都更有理由这么做
She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

难道你认为是个巧合?  乔佛里被杀当晚 她就消失不见了
Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

珊莎不是杀人凶手
Sansa's not a killer.

您要带我去哪儿? 
Where are you taking me?

我和你的莱莎阿姨就要成婚了
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.

她正在鹰巢城等着我们
She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.

在那里 你会很安全
You'll be safe there.

是您杀了乔佛里吗? 
Did you kill Joffrey?

几星期来 我一直留在谷地
I've been in the Vale for weeks.

那么 是谁帮我实施了这阴谋呢? 
And who helped me with this conspiracy?

嗯… 君临有唐托斯爵士
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

您利用他帮我逃出来 但您绝不会信任他 让他杀害国王
You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.

您很聪明 不会信任一个酒鬼
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

或许是你丈夫干的
Then perhaps it was your husband.

他和乔佛里的死没有关系
He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.

还记得唐托斯送你的那条漂亮的项链吗? 
Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?

我敢肯定 你一定没觉察到 宴会之后 上面少了一颗宝石
I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.

兰尼斯特家族赐给您财富和权力
The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.

乔佛里还让您成了赫伦堡公爵
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

一个没有动机的人 永远成不了嫌疑犯
A man with no motive is a man no one suspects.

永远都要让你的敌人迷惑
Always keep your foes confused.

如果他们看不清你的为人 猜不透你的打算 他们就不会知道你真正的目的和打算
If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.

如果被他们抓到 他们会把您的头插在枪尖上 就像对我父亲一样
If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's.

您会冒着这样的风险只为了迷惑他们? 
You'd risk that just to confuse them?

好多人 从来不敢冒险
So many men, they risk so little.

终其一生都在避开危险之事
They spend their lives avoiding danger.

为了得到我想要的 什么风险我都敢冒
I'd risk everything to get what I want.

您想要什么? 
And what do you want?

和兰尼斯特的友谊的确让我收益颇丰
My friendship with the Lannisters was productive.

但是乔佛里 他是个恶毒的小男孩 头上还带着王冠 这可不是个可靠的盟友
But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally.

谁会信任那样的朋友呢? 
And who could trust a friend like that?

我不和自己这样的人交朋友. 
I don't want friends like me.

我的新朋友做事不会出人意料
My new friends are predictable.

他们行事合乎情理
Very reasonable people.

至于发生在乔佛里身上的事 我的新朋友求之不得呢
As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly.

没有什么比一份贴心的礼物 更能让一份新友谊生生不息了
Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.

我真不敢相信您要离开
I can't believe you're going.

把我一个人留在这儿 和这些人待在一起
Leaving me alone here with these people.

时间差不多了 亲爱的
The time has come, my dear.

没什么事儿能比审判更厄长乏味
There's nothing more tedious than a trial.

大概除了这些花园吧
Except perhaps these gardens.

奥莲娜・雷德温
'荆棘女王'  玛格丽・提利尔的祖母

如果要让我在这些花园里再逛一圈 我宁愿现在就从悬崖上跳下去
If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

你去看过托曼了吗? 
Have you been to see Tommen yet?

他们同意这项婚事了没有? 
Have they even agreed to the match?

我什么消息都没听说
No one tells me anything.

你知道吗 最初的时候 我没被安排嫁给你的祖父 罗斯
I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know.

他和我姐姐订了婚 就是你的姑婆维奥拉
He was engaged to my sister, your greataunt Viola.

我本来得嫁给某个坦格利安
I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.

那时候嫁个坦格利安可流行了
Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.

但我一看到我要嫁的那一个 长着一张抽筋一样 紧张兮兮的白鼬脸 和一头滑稽的银发
But the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair,

我就知道 他不合适
I knew he wouldn't do.

所以那天夜里 在罗斯向我姐姐求婚之前
So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister,

我在从刺绣课回家的路上迷了路 一不小心 走到了他的房间里
I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.

看我多迷糊 嗯嗯
How absentminded of me. Mmhmm.

第二天早上 罗斯就没能下楼 去向我姐姐求婚  那小子 走都走不动了
The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

然后一旦他有了点力气 他唯一想要的 重温那一夜的体验
And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before.

非常 非常厉害
I was very, very good.

但你得动作快
But you need to act quickly.

瑟曦也许是个恶毒的女人 但她还不算蠢
Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.

很快她就会教她的孩子敌视你
She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.

等到你们成亲之后 你再想讨好他就晚了
And by the time you're married, it'll be too late.

幸运的是 摄政太后 现在被分了神 只顾着哀悼她早死的好儿子
Luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment.  mourning her dear departed boy.

指控自己的弟弟为杀人凶手 虽然他根本没下过手
Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.

他还是有可能下手的
Well, he could have done.

他有可能 但他没做
He could have done, but he didn't.

祖母大人 您又不知道 我当然知道
You don't know, Grandmother. But I do know.

你不会真以为我愿意让你嫁给那个小畜生吧? 
You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

什么? 我不明白
What? I don't understand.

嘘 别想太多
Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that.

做你该做的就行
You just do what needs to be done.

很多野人会手持两把武器
A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.

你们首先要做的就是打掉其中一把 这样他们就不占优势了
First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.

葛兰
'笨牛' 守夜人游骑兵

让我看看你们的本事
Let's see what you can do.

奥利 你在那看着就好
Olly, you just watch for now.

你之前握过剑吗? 
Have you ever held a sword before?

我以前是村子里最棒的弓手
I was the best archer in our hamlet.

改天咱们去打兔子
We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.

但现在 好好看 好好学
Rit now, watch and learn.

慢慢来 学着缴对方的械
Take it slow, try and disarm each other.

你挺会打
You know how to fight.

但下手应该轻一点
You could have gone easier on him.

那样他就什么都学不到了
He wouldn't have learned anything that way.

你以为你在干什么? 
What do you think you're doing?

葛兰和我正在训练他们
Grenn and I were helping them.

葛兰是个游骑兵 而你是个事务官
Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.

你之前跟那野人婊子搞在一起的时候可能已经把这事儿忘了 可我没有
Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.

得有人训练他们
Someone has to train them.

但那人不是你
And that someone isn't you.

倒夜壶去
Go find a chamber pot to empty.

你个叛徒的野种
You traitor's bastard.

莫尔蒙不在没人护着你了
Mormont's not here to protect you now.

这野种人气很旺啊 你却不是
The bastard's wellliked. You're not.

你觉得我会在乎人气? 我们正在打仗
You think I care if they like me? We're at war.

但你不能永远代理总司令
But you can't be acting commander forever.

不久就该选举了
There will be a choosing.

那老学士会坚持选出新的司令官
The old maester will insist on it.

听说那小子请求向卡斯特的城堡派兵 你可以重新考虑一下
You might reconsider his request to march on Craster's.

让叛徒们对付他吧
Let the mutineers take care of Snow.

否则你下半辈子 没准都得听他使唤了
Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.

你是贵族出身吧
Took you for highborn.

我父亲是贵族
My father was highborn.

你怎么会来这里的? 
What brought you up here?

我想为王国安宁尽一份力
I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.

我从前是风暴地的一名护猎员
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.

打了只宝贝山鹑给家里嗷嗷待哺的孩子
Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.

结果笨手笨脚被逮住了
I was stupid enough to get caught.

要么来长城 要么少一只手
Chose the Wall over losing my hand.

我琢麽着 来这儿就不用受什么老爷大人的窝囊气了
Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.

快啊 抓紧点
Come on, get on with it.

你们等什么呢 等夏天来吗? 
What are you waiting for? Summer?

您叫我 陛下? 
You sent for me, Your Grace?

托曼房外安排了几名御林铁卫? 
How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?

柏洛斯爵士今夜执勤
Ser Boros is on duty tonight.

明晚我想是…  只有一人? 
Tomorrow I believeSo one?

你就安排一个人来保护未来的国王? 
You have one man guarding the future king?

我保证托曼是安全的
I promise you Tommen's safe.

我们日夜保护他
We're protecting him.

就像你保护乔佛里那样? 
The way you protected Joffrey?

为什么凯特琳・史塔克会放了你? 
Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?

什么?  我已经想了好几个月
What? I've been wondering for months.

自从那头老母牛放你回君临我就开始琢磨
Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.

她为什么放了你? 
Why did she set you free?

她以为我能把女儿还给她
She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.

是她以为 还是你发誓? 
She hoped or did you promise?

我以新旧诸神之名发了誓 如果她的女儿们还活着 我就要把她们还给她
I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.

你对敌人发了神圣的誓言
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

我只想回到你身边
I wanted to get back to you.

难道我应该让她滚蛋吗? 
Should I have told her to fuck off?

你不是认真的 是吗? 
You didn't mean it, then?

你对凯特琳・史塔克毫无忠诚可言? 
You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?

凯特琳・史塔克已经死了
Catelyn Stark's dead.

那如果我要你现在离开君临去找珊莎 如果我要你找到那杀人不眨眼的小婊子 把她的脑袋给我带回来 你会照办吗? 
So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?

我知道你去见提利昂了
I know you went to see Tyrion.

那怪胎谋杀了我们的儿子
That creature who murdered our son.

我必须自己去了解真相
I had to know for myself.

不是他干的 瑟曦
He didn't do it, Cersei.

你总是同情他
You've always pitied him.

同情我们的小弟
Our poor little brother.

被父亲和姐姐鄙视
Despised by his father and sister.

一旦有机会 他会把我们全杀了
He'd kill us all if he could.

我要托曼房外日夜都有四个人值守
I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.

就这样吧 队长大人
That will be all, Lord Commander.

你是怎么绕过御林铁卫的? 
How did you get past the Kingsguard?

我觉得你不该在这儿
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

妈妈不许我晚上会客
Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.

我不是客人 陛下
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.

据说我将是您的新娘
Word has it I'm to be your bride.

您知道吗? 包办婚姻的主角 通常直到婚礼那天才第一次见面
Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day?

在我们决定共度余生之前 我们首先应该了解彼此
Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another.

可如果妈妈发现了…
But if my mother found out

这可以成为我们的秘密 嗯? 
It can be our secret. Hmm?

如果我们要结为夫妻 我希望我们跟她之间能有秘密可言
If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.

你好 真是个好伙伴 是吧? 
Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?

乔佛里不喜欢他
Joffrey didn't like him.

他曾说要把它活剥了 把内脏掺进我的食物里 让我不知不觉把它吃下去
He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.

你不会那么残忍地对我的
You don't strike me as cruel.

因为 你知道我们结婚后会怎样吗? 
Because you know what happens when we marry?

我们会在大圣堂发下誓言
We say our vows in front of the high septon.

在仪式过后 会有一场盛宴
And after the ceremony, there's a feast.

结婚以后 我就是你的了
When we marry, I become yours.

我还可以再来看你吗? 
May I come and visit you again?

别忘了 我们的小秘密
Remember, our little secret.

'詹姆・兰尼斯特爵士
'Ser Jaime Lannister.

年仅十六岁时即受封为骑士 不久被任命为御林铁卫
Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year.

君临之战中 弑君伊里斯二世于铁王座之下
At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II.

后被新国王劳勃・拜拉席恩赦免
Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.

自此人称'弑君者'
Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.'

记录这些是队长的责任
It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages.

而我的部分还没有写完
And there's still room left on mine.

它是用奈德・史塔克的剑重铸的
It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.

你要用它来保护奈德・史塔克的女儿
You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.

你发誓要将史塔克家的女儿们送回母亲身边
You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.

艾丽娅很可能也死了 但你还有机会找到珊莎 保护她平安
Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.

我还有样东西送你
I've got something else for you.

希望我弄对了尺寸
I hope I got your measurements right.

还有份礼物呢
I have one more gift.

我不需要侍从
I don't need a squire.

我弟弟欠他个人情 他在这里不安全
My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here.

你会保护他的 这是骑士精神
You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.

我不会拖累您的 爵… 小姐
I won't slow you down, ser my lady.

我保证会好好服侍您
I promise I'll serve you well.

瞧见没? 他是个好小子 你们会好好相处的
See? He's a good lad. You'll get along.

这是提利昂大人的谢礼
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

他在黑水河之战用的斧子
His axe from the Blackwater.

你还等什么呢 一个吻? 
What are you waiting for, a kiss?

快去把小姐的马备好
Ready the lady's horse.

好剑都有好名字
They say the best swords have names.

我当初真不该带她走
I should never have taken her away.

她在这里不安全 她在那里也不安全
She wasn't safe here. She's not safe out there.

山姆威尔・塔利
'杀手' 守夜人事务官

你告诉过我们长城南边也有野人
You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.

如果他们在劫掠那些小村落 鼹鼠村可能就是下一个目标
If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.

黑城堡也可能是下一个目标 我该回去接吉莉
Castle Black could be next. I should go back for Gilly.

我们有令在身 不能离开城堡
We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.

我记得你曾经抗命南下去帮助罗柏
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.

我也记得是谁追上我然后把我带回来
And I remember who came after me and brought me home.

我知道这有多难 山姆 相信我
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.

当你跟我讲布兰越过长城时 我唯一的念头就是赶快振作起来 好出去找他
When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.

我希望我能说服他跟我一起回来
I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.

我尽力了 真的 我尽力了
I tried. Really, I did.

他们能跑多快? 
How fast could they travel?

一个傻子拉着雪橇 上面坐一个残废的孩子? 
A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?

他们会经过野人的村落
They'd pass wildling villages.

可以找到歇脚的地方
They could try to find shelter at one of them.

野人们都去跟曼斯了
The wildlings have joined up with Mance.

这些村落或者歇脚的地方不会有人的
Every village or sheltered place will be deserted.

你觉得布兰会不会发现…
You think Bran might have found

抱歉打扰了
I don't mean to interrupt.

索恩要见你
Thorne wants to see you.

我批准你们
Your foray to Craster's Keep,

但我不会命令任何人与你同行
But I won't order anyone to go with you.

谢谢你 艾里沙爵士
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

我要越过长城前往卡斯特的城堡
I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep.

我要抓住据守在那里的叛徒 或者杀掉他们
I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them.

派普尔
'派普' 守夜人

我需要志愿者与我同行
I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

这里和卡斯特的城堡之间是 60 英里的荒野 还有正在逼近的曼斯・雷德的大军 但我们必须这么做
There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this.

我们的存亡取决于 我们能否在曼斯之前找到这些叛徒
Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does.

他们了解长城 了解我们的布防
They know the Wall. They know our defenses.

如果曼斯知道了这些情报 我们就完蛋了
If Mance learns what they know, we're lost.

如果这还不够的话 那么想想看
But if that's not enough, then consider this.

如果守夜人彼此真的是兄弟 那么莫尔蒙总司令大人就是我们的父亲
If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.

他把一生奉献给守夜人 却被自己的手下背叛
He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.

背后被懦夫捅了刀子
Stabbed in the back by cowards.

他应该有更好待遇才对 #####
He deserved far better.

我们现在能做的是去为他讨回公道
All we can give him now is justice.

我可不能让一个新兵跑到长城北面去
I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.

那么就让我去宣誓吧
Then let me say my vows.

如果你要奔赴战场 那么你需要一个会打仗的人
If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.

琴酒巷的卡尔・坦纳 拿杰奥・他妈的・莫尔蒙 的天灵盖喝酒
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.

总司令大人 有何吩咐? 
Any command for us, Lord Commander?

把她们操到死? 
Fuck 'em till they're dead?

听到了吗 小子们? 
Did you hear that, boys?

操到死
Fuck 'em till they're dead.

出去喂那头畜生
Go outside and feed the beast.

我们应该杀掉它
We should kill that thing.

你他妈的应该闭嘴 小丑逼
You should shut your fucking hole, ugly little cunt.

你他妈看上去就像个尿泡
You look like a fucking ballsack.

丑货 看看你那贱德行
Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face.

老子撒泡尿能把五个你都淹了
I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you.

知道老子在君临城杀一个人能挣多少钱吗? 
Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing?

只要告诉老子名字 那个人就别想再见着太阳了
They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again.

那些个人渣 没一个能逃得掉
None of them cocksuckers got away from me.

老子九岁以来打架就没输过
Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.

你怎么看 嗯? 
What do you think, eh?

也许你能打败老子
Maybe you're the man.

我可打不赢你
I wouldn't stand a chance.

老子他妈在琴酒巷就是个传说
I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.

老子能干翻任何一个骑士… 甭管是谁 甭管啥时候
I would take any knight any knight, any time.

那些他妈的缩在板甲里的贱人 胆小鬼
Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.

献给众神的礼物 献给众神的礼物
A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.

这他妈是啥
What the fuck is that?

卡斯特最后一个孩子 一个男孩
Craster's last child. A boy.

老子得怎么处理他? 
What am I supposed to do with him?

卡斯特是怎么处理的? 
What did Craster do with 'em?

在小崽子能杀死爹之前先杀了他们? 
Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him?

少一个人抢饭碗也好
Don't need another mouth to feed.

递过来 卡斯特没有杀掉他们
Hand him over. He didn't kill them.

而是献祭他们 给谁? 
He offered them. To who?

献给众神的礼物 献给众神的礼物
A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.

献给众神的礼物 献给众神的礼物
A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.

献给众神的礼物 献给众神的礼物
A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.

既然… 卡斯特这样行得通…
So...  if it worked for him...

我们不妨也给异鬼们他们想要的
Let's give the walkers what they want.

雷斯特 交给你了
Rast is headed that way.

不 我们不能分开
No, we need to stay together.

布兰 布兰 阿多 阿多
Bran. Bran. Hodor. Hodor.

阿多 布兰 发生什么事了? 
Hodor. Bran, what happened?

夏天受伤了 他们用陷阱抓住了它
Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.

我没看见 但他们还抓住了我哥哥的狼
I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf.

他们是守夜人
They're Night's Watch.

如果琼恩在 为啥把狼关进笼子? 
If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?

他们也许曾经是守夜人 现在不是了
They might have been Night's Watch once, not anymore.

我们在这里不安全 得走了
We're not safe here. We need to go.

布兰 我们现在得走了
Bran, we need to go now.

救不出夏天我不会走
I'm not leaving without Summer.

你能回忆下笼子在哪吗? 
Can you remember where the cage was?

城堡的东面
The east side of the keep.

如果我一时没回来 我们在…
If I'm not back soon, we'll meet

如果我有你这块头 我他妈就是这个世界的王了
If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.

看 在老家那边 像老子这种贱民扇你这种少爷一个耳光
You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you,

得掉一只手
I'd lose my right hand.

不过我们离家远着呢 不是吗? 
But we're a long way from home, aren't we?

还有你们俩 塞外的美人们 在树林里爬行
And the two of you, fancylooking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods.

很奇怪啊
Isn't that a bit odd?

老子喜欢你的卷发
I like your curly hair.

跟我妈的头发一样
My mom had curls like that.

漂亮的棕色卷发
Beautiful brown curls.

你们干嘛拖着一个残废孩子跑到这里来? 
Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?

看来你们没玩过这游戏
See you haven't played this game before.

一个贵族人质 是很值钱的
A highborn hostage, that's valuable.

但是三个的话 就是三张嘴要喂
But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.

他他妈的怎么了
What the fuck's wrong with him?

求你 让我帮他
Please. Please, let me help him.

你是谁?  我是布兰登・史塔克
Who are you? I'm Brandon Stark!

我是临冬城的布兰登・史塔克
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

是琼恩・雪诺的弟弟
It's Jon Snow's brother.

是梅拉 是梅拉 我在这儿呢
It's Meera. It's Meera. I'm right here.

老子还头疼今天怎么熬呢
And I thought this was gonna be another boring day.

愿战士赐予他勇气 佑他穿越艰险
May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times.

愿铁匠赐予他力量 助他肩负重任
May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden

愿老妪 愿知晓所有人命运的老妪 指明他的必经之路 引领他穿过前方的黑暗
And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
'弑君者'  御林铁卫队长

在七神的光辉之下 我宣布 拜拉席恩家族的托曼一世
In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name

为安达尔人和先民的国王 和七大王国的的统治者
King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

陛下  陛下
Your Grace. Your Grace.

他坐在王座上 就像天生的王者
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

对 但他曾经不是
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

你还在为乔佛里哀悼吗? 
You still mourn for Joffrey?

他曾是我的丈夫 我的国王
He was my husband. My king.

他本会成为你的噩梦
He would have been your nightmare.

你很清楚他是什么样的人
You knew exactly what he was.

没有任何感情可以代替 你对自己第一个孩子的爱
You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.

无论他们做了什么
Doesn't matter what they do.

其实他的所作所为让我震惊
And what he did, it shocked me.

你觉得我是会被轻易震惊的人吗? 
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

但我真的被他的行为震惊了
The things he did shocked me.

一个心地善良 品行端正的孩子
A good boy. A decent boy.

我在想 上一个品行端正的国王是谁? 
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

他会成为近五十年来第一个 真正有资格坐在王座上的国王
He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

相对于把他推上王位的那场灾祸
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

这也算是一种安慰了 不是吗? 
For all the horror that put him there.

如果他想统治好… 就需要别人的帮助
He will need help...  if he's going to rule well.

仅有母亲是不够的
A mother is not enough.

你仍想当王后 是吗? 
You're still interested in being queen, I take it?

经历了这么多之后… 我知道这听起来很奇怪, 但我…
After all that's happened-- it sounds strange, I know, but I am--

我还从来没有考虑过 接下来要做什么
I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next.

当然 这将会是无上的荣誉
It would be a great honor, of course.

但我需要和我父亲商量一下
But I will have to speak to my father about it.

是啊 和你的父亲商量一下吧
Yes, speak to your father.

接下来 怕是要有一连串的婚礼等着咱们了
We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.

我都不知道该称呼您什么好
I won't even know what to call you.

乔佛里·拜拉席恩国王死了
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

在他自己的婚礼上被谋杀
Murdered at his own wedding.

另外我们已经控制了弥林的海军 陛下
And we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

次子团接管了弥林海军
The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.

谁允许你这么做的? 
Who told you to take the navy?

那你为什么要这样做? 
So why did you do it?

我听说您喜欢船
I heard you liked ships.

能载多少人? 
How many men can they carry?

不算水手的话 九千三百人
9,300, not counting sailors.

要攻下君临 这些人够么? 
Would that be enough to take King's Landing?

兰尼斯特的兵力更多
The Lannisters have more.

他们已为乔佛里征战多年
They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.

疲惫不堪 而且兵力分散
They're tired, dispersed.

如今国王已死
And now their king is dead.

八千无垢者 两千次子团 驶入黑水湾中 可以迅雷之势突破城门
8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.

很难说 也许人数是够了
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

但我们并非要让您只成为君临的女王
But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.

而一万人可征服不了整个维斯特洛
10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

一旦女王渡过狭海 那些古老的家族都将蜂拥至女王旗下
The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

那些家族都是些墙头草 只会拥护胜者 他们向来如此
The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.

没有了无垢者来巩固您的统治 贤主大人们重新控制了城市
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.

他们重新奴役了留在那里的自由人 并且发誓要向您复仇
They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.

还有 在阿斯塔波 由您任命统治城市的议会 被一个叫克莱昂的屠夫推翻了 他还以'伟大的国王'自居
And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself 'His Imperial Majesty.'

似乎我解放奴隶湾的行动 进行得并不顺利
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.

您可以把这一切都抛之脑后 直接驶向维斯特洛
You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind.

现在坐在铁王座上的只是个男孩
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

而且很多人认为他是私生子 根本不配继位
A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.

这正是敌人最脆弱之时
They've never been more vulnerable.

在魁尔斯你曾劝阻我不要急躁
You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.

后来一切都顺利
That all worked out well.

如果我连奴隶湾都无法控制 又该如何统治七大王国? 
How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

人们有什么理由信任我? 
Why should anyone trust me?

人们有什么理由追随我? 
Why should anyone follow me?

您是龙之母
You're the Mother of Dragons.

这还不够
I need to be more than that.

我不会让那些被我解放的人重新戴上镣铐
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.

我不去维斯特洛了
I will not sail for Westeros.

我要做女王该做的事情
I will do what queens do.

培提尔·贝里席
'小指头' 赫伦堡公爵

但他们怎么认出我是谁? 
But how would they know?

你知道穷人最喜欢听什么故事吗? 
You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?

是那些他们永远无缘得见的富家女的故事
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

去鹰巢城只有这条路吗? 
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?

这山是无法穿越的
The mountains are impassable.

想要抵达鹰巢城 只能通过血门
If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

无论你有多少军队 想要攻打血门 你就得走这条路 三人并排 然后像山羊一样被宰掉
It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats.

谷地最早的领主们并没有什么财富 但他们拥有这些山 而且他们懂得物尽其用
The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.

他们在这里建造的城堡从未被攻陷过
And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.

一千年来一次也没有
Not once in 1,000 years.

了解自己的优势 合理发挥优势 就能以一敌万
Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.

是谁要通过血门? 
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

培提尔·贝里席公爵和他的侄女阿莲
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

欢迎回来 培提尔大人
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

我有个小礼物送给你
I have brought you a gift.

夫人  你看培提尔叔叔给我带了什么
My lady. Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

漂亮的礼物 送给可爱的男孩
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

很荣幸见到您 艾林夫人
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

哦 把兜帽摘下来吧 孩子
Oh, do take down that hood, child.

你不觉得我早已知晓你的身份吗? 
Don't you think I know who you are?

你以为我会让我的未婚夫 因为紧急事务离开鹰巢城 而我却不知道所为何事? 
You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was?

我放他离开 他才能把你带来我这儿
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.

见到您真是太好了 莱莎姨妈
It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

在其他人面前千万不能这样叫我
You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.

当然 我明白
Of course. I understand.

不能让任何人知道你在这里
No one can know you're here.

否则我们的处境将非常危险
It would put us in a very precarious position.

我一个字也不会透露的
I would never say a thing.

多年以来
The Lannisters want to destroy us.

兰尼斯特家族一直在试图摧毁我们
They've been trying for years.

结果现在他们倒尝到了被摧毁的滋味
Now they know what it feels like.

妈妈说 他们杀了你妈妈还砍了你哥哥的脑袋
Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.

没错 还砍了我父亲的头
They did, and my father's.

他们也杀了我父亲 用毒药
They killed my father, too, with poison.

我想让那个兰尼斯特小矮子飞 但妈妈不让我这么做
I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.

从月门飞
Through the Moon Door.

更重要的是 他们还硬要你嫁给那个下流的侏儒
And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.

是的 其实我俩都是被迫的
They did. They made us both.

提利昂大人也不情愿
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

这我一点儿都不信
I don't believe that for a moment.

他有没有强上了你? 
Did he force himself on you?

罗宾 她是你的表姐 珊莎
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

但在其他人面前 你不能叫她珊莎 只有在我和培提尔叔叔面前才行 懂了吗
But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand?

珊莎 这是我的儿子罗宾
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

很高兴见到你 罗宾
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

罗宾 带珊莎去她的寝室
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.

走后楼梯
Take the back stairs.

去吧 我们待会聊
Go. We'll speak soon.

你怎么耽误了这么久? 
What took you so long?

忙着安排托曼一世继位 救出珊莎 还有把她安全送到这儿
Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

她已经安全抵达了 今晚在她身上花的时间已经太多了
She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.

我们今晚成婚吧
Let's get married tonight.

这样的喜事...  我们不该先通知谷地的领主们吗
Ought we not...  inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?

谷地只有一个领主
There's only one Lord of the Vale.

其他人统统去死吧
The others can all hang.

一个个趴在楼梯上像秃鹫一样笑脸迎合 我丈夫一死 他们就开始觊觎着我
Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.

我认为我们得等…
I do think that we could wait until--

我等够了 培提尔
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

我们多年前就早已有过婚姻之实了
We had our wedding night many years ago.

你不记得了吗? 
Or don't you remember?

清晰如昨日
Like it was yesterday.

什么样的妻子会像我那般待你? 
What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?

什么样的妻子会像我那般信任你? 
What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?

当你给我那剂毒药 让我下在琼恩的酒里 我丈夫的酒里时 -- 当你让我写信给凯特 告诉她是兰尼斯特 --
When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine-- when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters--

若不提及 便非真相
Only speaking of it can make it real.

让我先为婚礼沐浴更衣吧
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

等我准备好 就去召修士来
Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.

我和我丈夫在床上可是要叫出来的
I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.

我要大声的叫 叫声要传到狭海对岸
I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.

你打算何时举行婚礼? 
When will the wedding take place in your mind?

什么时候合适都行
As soon as decency permits.

要先给托曼足够的时间哀悼他的哥哥 玛格丽也要哀悼她的丈夫
After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.

两周?  我觉得合理
A fortnight? That seems reasonable.

不要杂耍 不要侏儒比武 也不要七十七道菜
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.

那你什么时候嫁给洛拉斯? 
And your wedding to Loras?

托曼成婚不久后
Shortly after Tommen's.

不久后?  两周后
Shortly? A fortnight.

我知道你不喜欢他们
I know you don't like them.

我之前也不喜欢你丈夫
I didn't like your husband.

他以前总爱拍我的背
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

这点我们倒是一样
We had that in common.

我们与人结盟 但没必要信任他们
You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.

那可以信任谁? 
Then whom can we trust?

提利尔 是唯一可以在资源上 与我们抗衡的家族 而我们需要他们的支持
The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.

劳勃是不怎么有钱
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

劳勃有我们的资助
Robert had me funding him.

战争开销如流水
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

所以我们之前才能大获全胜
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.

你知道去年西境总共开采了多少金矿吗? 
Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?

来 猜猜看
Go on, your best guess.

磅 吨 还是盎司? 
Pounds, tons, ounces?

不管什么单位 答案都是一样
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

我们的最后一个金矿三年前就空了
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

那我们怎么应付的开销? 
Then how do we pay for anything?

王座欠着铁金库的债 一笔巨债
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.

铁金库肯定有好说话的人 你跟他通融通融
There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

铁金库就是铁金库
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

那也是有人干活的地方 是由人组成的机构
Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.

一座神庙还是一块块石头组成的呢
And a temple is comprised of stones.

一块石头碎了 大不了另一块补上
One stone crumbles and another takes its place.

神庙照样能屹立千年不倒
And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more.

铁金库就是这样一座神庙
That's what the Iron Bank is-a temple.

我们都活在它的阴影下却不自知
We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.

你无法逃离他们 无法欺骗他们
You can't run from them. You can't cheat them.

你不能拿借口来搪塞
You can't sway them with excuses.

如果你欠他们钱 还想活命的话 就乖乖还钱
If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.

把提利尔笼络在朝廷里 在这方面对我们有利
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.

都是为了家族利益 我明白
It's for the good of the family, I understand that.

但我的兄弟们未必明白
I'm not sure my brothers do.

我知道你心里认定提利昂有罪
I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.

作为母亲 你有权这么做
And as a mother, that is your right.

但我作为法官 我不能与你讨论审判
But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.

我们没必要讨论
We don't need to discuss it.

没什么比兰尼斯特家族的传承更重要
The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.

为了保护家族 你发动了一场战争
You've started wars to protect this family.

詹姆不愿继承家业 你已与他决裂
Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.

提利昂亲手将家族的未来付之一炬 又该付出什么样的代价? 
What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?

我不念一遍这些名字就睡不着
I can't sleep until I say the names.

念遍每个维斯特洛人的鸟名字么
The names of every fucking person in Westeros?

只有那些我要杀的人
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

仇恨可是支撑人活下去的好东西
Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.

等碰上我哥哥 也许我们都能在自己的名单上划掉一个人
We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

要是他现在就在这 你要怎么做? 
If he were here right now, what would you do?

我会让他闭上臭嘴 让我好好睡觉
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep.

快点 把它念完得了 你那个杀人名单
Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.

你妈妈一直喜欢甜食 知道吗? 
Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?

晚饭时 她都是直奔蜂蜜蛋糕 还有蜜饯杏仁 奶油蛋羹
At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard.

最后你外公 不得不派个修女吃饭时监督她
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.

毕竟凯特是长女
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

只有保持魅力 父亲才能为她安排一门好亲事 她却开始长胖
It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.

她从来不准我 在晚饭前吃布丁
She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.

我说的是她嫁给你爸去北境之前的事
This is before she married your father and moved to the North.

到你出生时 你父亲的简朴作风已经把她传染了
By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.

婚姻能改变人
Marriage changes people.

我不是让你停下
I didn't mean for you to stop.

好吃吗? 
How do you like them?

哪里来的柠檬? 这里这么高肯定种不了
Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.

Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.

他在决斗中差点杀了培提尔
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.

你妈却对他死心塌地
And your mother loved him anyway.

你妈对培提尔 还比不上他养的那帮妓女 培提尔却舍命救你
And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels.

他跟你说过那些妓女么?  没有
Has he told you about them? No.

他没告诉过你 她们都用身体做什么可耻的事情?

你让培提尔对你的身体做过什么? 
What have you let Petyr do with your body?

莱莎阿姨 没有 我…  你这年轻的 美丽的身体
Aunt Lysa, no, I-Your young, pretty body.

什么也没有 我还是处女 别对我撒谎
Nothing. I'm a virgin. Don't lie to me.

你骗不了我
I'll know if you lie.

我还是处女 我发誓
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

他爱你 莱莎阿姨
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

他只说过我是个笨女孩
All he says is that I'm stupid.

我是个有着愚蠢梦想的笨女孩 永远也不会吸取教训 还有我是个糟糕的骗子 所以我应该永远说真话
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth.

我向您发誓他从来没有碰过我
And I swear to you that he has never touched me.

一次也没有 从来没有 嘘 嘘 嘘
Not once, not ever. Shh. Shh. Shh.

铁王座目前属于 拜拉席恩家族的托曼
The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon,

安达尔人和先民的国王
King of the Andals and the First Men,

七大王国的统治者与全境守护者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

他与我毫无血脉关系
He shares no blood with me.

他乃是乱伦所生的私生子
He is a bastard born of incest.

这点和他哥哥一个样
As was his brother before him.

是哦 我们听过这故事
Yes, we have heard this story.

这不是故事 这是真相
It's not a story. It's the truth.

可国王的外公却讲了个不同的故事
The king's grandfather tells a different story.

故事里 一个嫉妒的叔叔 为了从正统国王手中篡夺王位 不惜让七大王国血流遍地 耗尽钱财
A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.

现在你觉得你的血脉给了你借钱的理由? 
And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?

比任何在世的人理由都充分
More than any man living.

在狭海那一边 你的账簿里满是 '篡夺者' '疯子'之类的词语 也有'血统纯正'
Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like 'usurper' and 'madman' and 'blood right.'

而在这里 我们的账簿里都是些数字
Here, our books are filled with numbers.

我们更喜欢他们讲的故事
We prefer the stories they tell.

不那么充满歧义
Less open to interpretation.

还有多少战士忠于你? 
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

你还有多少艘船? 
And how many ships do you have?

当然是指还能漂着的船 戴佛斯爵士 不包括沉在黑水河底下的
The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

龙石岛能出产多少 小麦 大麦 牛肉和猪肉 来供养您那 32 艘船上的 4000 勇士? 
And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

那么您应该明白 为什么从我们的角度来看 这些数字不太可能推导出一个美好的结果
You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective.

我很抱歉我们必须恭恭敬敬地 拒绝您的要求
I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request.

但我们对您的赏光表示最衷心的感谢
But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.

我可不是什么大人 戴佛斯・席渥斯爵士
I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.

当然您在这儿也不是什么爵士
You would not be either here.

在布拉佛斯 我们可不会给小偷奖励什么头衔
In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.

噢 严格地说 我不干偷窃的勾当
Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving.

那是海盗的活计
That would be the pirates.

我只是把他们偷来的东西从一个地方搬到另一个地方
I just moved what they stole from one place to another.

而这个 是史坦尼斯国王 让我为自己的罪行付出的代价
This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes.

我认为那是一个公正的裁决
I consider it an honest accounting.

他是个公正的人 也是你们最好的机会 能让你们收回在维斯特洛的坏账
He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.

我想那一定是笔大数目 战争总是耗费钱财的
Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.

只要史坦尼斯国王还活着, 战争就没有结束
As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.

谁在君临握有实权? 
Who's the real power in King's Landing?

戴佛斯爵士…  回答我
Ser Davos... Humor me.

泰温・兰尼斯特 泰温・兰尼斯特多大了? 
Tywin Lannister. How old is Tywin Lannister?

67  67 岁了 那他死后 何人统治? 
67. 67. And when he dies, who's in command?

一个半大孩子 还是乱伦的产物
A half-grown boy, the product of incest?

或是瑟曦・兰尼斯特 一个人人厌恶的太后
Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?

还是詹姆・兰尼斯特 因为杀死 自己宣誓要保护的君主而闻名的人? 
Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect?

一旦泰温死了 还有谁能给你还债? 
When Tywin's gone, who do you back?

那是以后的问题了
That is a problem for another time.

恕我直言 这是当下的问题
Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now.

这儿 站着维斯特洛仅存的一位可靠的领主
There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.

他有与生俱来的继承权
He's got the birthright.

身经战争的洗礼
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

他绝不空谈什么给人回报 而是身体力行
And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.

哨兵看见有艘海盗船驶向他们
The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.

船长对他的大副喊道
The captain shouts to his first mate,

大副拿来了红衬衫 船长穿上它
The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.

当海盗试图登船 这个勇敢的船长带着他的船员们取得了胜利
And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory.

几天后 哨兵又开始喊叫
A few days later, the lookout screams,

船员们像老鼠一样吓得发抖
The crew is shivering like scared mice.

但英勇的船长再一次喊道
But the courageous captain hollers,

战斗平息后 大副问道
After the battle, the first mate asks,

第二天早晨哨兵又开始呼喊
The next morning the lookout screams,

船员们一片沉默
The crew goes silent.

他们看向那勇敢的船长 等着他一贯的命令
They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command.

死水一般的寂静 船长大吼
Calm as ever, the captain bellows...

你觉得她们遇到的哪个海盗不和她讲这个笑话? 
You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?

我听说你在龙石岛的地牢里烂掉了
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.

来吧 朋友 加入我们 来吧
Join us, my friend. Join us.

而这位是…  我才是劳拉
And this is-I am Lhara.

她是个艺术家 这一位 真的
She's an artist, this one, truly.

恐怕没时间了 我们日出就得起航
No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.

我以前还以为这人爱我呢
Once I thought this man loved me.

现在我知道他根本没把我当回事儿
Now I know he despises me.

他竟然想让我孤苦伶仃 身上一个子儿没有地死在某个冷冰冰…
He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--

而且绝不会没钱可拿
And you won't be poor.

我已经在你家里留了一箱金器
There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.

给了你老婆
I gave it to your wife.

朋友啊 你绝对不是我朋友
You're not my friend, my friend.

我们日出见
I'll see you at sunrise.

'我以满月为限 命令所有铁渣滓统统滚出北境 回到你们称之为家的粘着屎的石头上
'I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home.

满月后的第一个晚上
On the first night of the full moon,

我会狩捕还在我们领土上的每一个岛民 并将其活活剥皮 就像我活剥在临冬城找到的
I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum

20 个铁渣滓那样
I found at Winterfell.

盒子里我放了份特别的礼物
In the box you'll find a special gift--

席恩最喜欢的玩具
Theon's favorite toy.

当我将它拿走时 席恩哭了
He cried when I took it away from him.

滚出北境 不然还会有更多的盒子 里面装着更多的席恩
Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.

落款 拉姆斯? 雪诺 卢斯? 波顿  恐怖堡领主
Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton,

兼北境守护的 亲生儿子'
Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.'

他们活剥了我们的国民 他们还阉了我弟弟 你们的王子
They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince.

他们对他所做的每一件事 也是在对你们这么做
Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.

只要他们能伤害我们的王子却不受惩罚 那铁种这个词就毫无意义
As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.

席恩・葛雷乔伊 我不知道…
Theon Greyjoy. I don't know--

我来这儿是找席恩・葛雷乔伊
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.

带我去地牢
Take me to the dungeons.

他不在地牢
He's not in the dungeons.

右边最后一个笼子 谢了
Last cage on the right. Thank you.

没事了 是我 亚拉
It's all right. It's me, Yara.

跟他说 跟他说你骗不了我
Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.

席恩 我没骗你 我是来救你的
I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.

臭佬! 我是臭佬! 他们来了
Reek! My name is Reek!  They're here.

在这被堵住 我们就死定了
If they catch us in here, we're trapped.

不行! 你是席恩・葛雷乔伊
You can't! You're Theon Greyjoy.

不 我不相信你! 我知道我是谁!
No, I don't believe her! I know who I am!

我是臭佬! 忠诚的臭佬!
I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek!

乖乖的臭佬! 我永远是臭佬!
Good Reek! I've always been Reek!

今晚真是妙不可言
This is turning into a lovely evening.

把我弟弟还给我 你的人就不必再为此丧命
Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.

你比这货更有种
You've got bigger balls than he ever did.

不过光是有种可不够… 咱们看看你能跑多快? 
But with those big balls of yours...  how fast can you run?

立刻回船上
Make for the ship, now.

我有个惊喜给你
I have a treat for you.

那些玩意儿夜里来 想要带你走
Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away.

而你没让他们得逞
And you didn't let them.

我… 我不想他们带我走
I-I didn't want them to take me.

我不想他们…  是的 是的 臭佬
I didn't want them-Yes, yes, Reek.

还有裤子呢 臭佬
The britches, too, Reek.

臭佬 你爱我吗? 
Do you love me, Reek?

当然 大人 当然
Yes, of course, my lord.

那么你得帮我做点事
Because I need you to do something for me.

很重要的事
Something very important.

你瞧 现在有座城堡
There's a castle, you see.

被坏人霸占着
Some bad men hold this castle.

你得帮我把城堡抢回来
I need your help to take this castle back.

你得演出好戏
I need you to play a role.

假扮别人
To pretend to be someone you're not.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

他说他曾经为您祝福, 祝您战胜那些奴隶主
He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.

我感谢他的祝福
I thank him for his prayers.

他说 是您的龙干的
It was your dragons, he says.

他们今早袭击了他的羊群
They came this morning for his flock.

他说他不想冒犯陛下 可是他现在一无所有了
He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.

告诉他 我非常同情他的遭遇
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.

我不能还给他山羊 但我会付给他三倍价值的赔偿
I cannot bring back his goats, but I will see he is paid their value three times over.

叫下一个上来
Send the next one in.

关于您美貌的传闻丝毫没有夸张
Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.

我来自弥林最古老最高贵的家族之一
Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.

接见你是我的荣幸
Then it is my honor to receive you.

家父是弥林最有威望最受爱戴的市民 负责监管, 修复和维护 弥林最宏伟最有代表性的建筑
My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.

其中就包括这些金字塔
This pyramid included.

为此致上我的敬意
For that, he has my gratitude.

我希望能有幸见到他
I should be honored to meet him.

陛下 您已经见过了
You have, Your Grace.

我祝您永远不会看到您的家人 被如此残忍地虐待
I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.

令尊把无辜的孩童钉死在十字架上
Your father crucified innocent children.

家父公开反对这种做法
My father spoke out against crucifying those children.

他说这是罪恶的行径 但是孤掌难鸣
He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.

用罪行来惩罚罪行是否公正呢? 
Is it justice to answer one crime with another?

我很遗憾你失去了父亲 但是伟主大人们是罪有应得
I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime.

你最好给我记住这一点
You'd be wise to remember that.

您是女王 而我是弥林的仆从
You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.

我不愿意看到弥林的传统被废除
A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.

你在说哪项传统? 
And what traditions do you speak of?

葬礼的传统
The tradition of funeral rite.

在圣恩神庙举行体面的葬礼
Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.

家父和 162 位弥林贵族 仍然被钉在木桩上 被秃鹰啄食 被烈日暴晒
My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.

陛下 我恳求您下令放下这些人 以便体面地下葬
Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.

那么 弥林贵族们钉在十字架上的奴隶孩子们怎么办? 
And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?

他们也在烈日下暴晒
They were rotting in the sun as well.

你会恳求我也给他们体面下葬的权利吗? 
Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?

陛下 我不是在为伟主大人们辩护
Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.

我只是一个深爱着父亲的儿子
I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.

我请求您放他下来
Let me take his body down.

允许我带他到神庙 办理高贵的丧仪 这样他在彼岸才能寻得安宁
Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.

西茨达拉? 佐? 洛拉克 你可以埋葬你的父亲
Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.

回陛下 还有 212 个人请求觐见
There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.

传唤下一个
Send the next one in.

奥柏伦・马泰尔
'红毒蛇' 多恩亲王

开会非得这么早吗? 
These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they?

我昨晚熬得挺晚
I was up late last night.

是不是说我现在也是个什么大臣了? 
So, does this mean I am a master of something now?

泰温大人和我已经决定 由我来担任海政大臣 在你…
Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--

泰温大人 很荣幸 忝列御前会议之席 我…
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--

审判在下午进行
The trial begins this afternoon.

只有上午有点时间来处理事务
We only have the morning for affairs of state.

大人 有人在河间地 看到了桑铎? 克里冈
Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.

懦夫 叛徒
A coward and a traitor.

我的小小鸟儿报告说猎狗杀了我们五个士兵
My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

我认为他肯定说了'操他妈的国王'这种话
I believe the phrase 'fuck the king' was uttered.

要出多少钱才能让普通士兵 蠢到去猎狗身上碰运气? 
What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?

10 枚银鹿应该够丰厚了
10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.

100 枚 还有呢? 
Make it 100. What else?

大人 来自东方的情报越来越多了
More whispers from the east, my lord.

丹妮莉丝攻占了弥林
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.

她征服了那里 以女王的身份统治那里
She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.

她有一支无垢者大军 陛下
She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.

她还有一支雇佣军… 次子团
She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons.

他有两位骑士辅佐…
She has two knights advising her--

乔拉・莫尔蒙和巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.

另外 她有三头龙
And she has three dragons.

每年都在长大啊 陛下
Larger every year, Your Grace.

莫尔蒙是我们的卧底
Mormont is spying on her for us.

已经不是了 看来他现在全心效忠于她
No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her.

至于巴利斯坦爵士 看来他比我们预想 更难接受自己被开除出御林铁卫的事实
As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.

保护不了我的儿子
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

乔佛里的死又不是因为他的失职
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

开除他既无礼又愚蠢
Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.

别跟我说你正在担心半个世界以外的一个小丫头
Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.

这个小丫头有两名善战的勇士辅佐 帐下还有一支劲旅 陛下
A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.

我曾在厄斯索斯亲眼见过无垢者
I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

他们在战场上十分勇猛
They are very impressive on the battlefield.

床上稍微差点
Less so in the bedroom.

三百年来 赢得战争的不是龙
Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.

而是军队
Armies win them all the time.

她的问题必须被处理妥当
She must be dealt with.

如果真到了那个地步的话 武力是最终手段
Eventually, if it comes to that.

你的小小鸟能渗透到弥林吗? 
Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?

当然可以 首相大人
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

嗯 提利尔大人 帮我个忙
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.

把羽毛笔和纸递给我
Fetch my quill and paper.

叫我瓦里斯就好 实际上我不是贵族
Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.

任何人都没有义务称我为大人
No one is under obligation to call me lord.

但是每个人都这样做
And yet everyone does.

你好像对无垢者了解颇深啊
You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.

你在厄索斯待过很久吗? 
Did you spend much time in Essos?

这世界广阔而美丽
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

但大多数人从生到死 只能窝在自己出生的那个小角落 却无缘见识别处的风景
Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it.

我不想成为这样的人
I don't want to be most of us.

不是所有人都是亲王
Most of us aren't princes.

我能分辨人们的口音
I have an ear for accents.

我早就没有口音了
I've lost my accent entirely.

但我仍旧能分辨得出
I have an ear for that as well.

你是怎么来到这儿的? 
How did you get here?

也是你不愿告诉别人的故事
One you don't like telling people.

你应该去妓院 见见我的情妇艾拉莉亚
My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.

她会觉得你非常有趣
You should come to the brothel and meet her.

我们自己带了的酒 不是这里的那些泔水
We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.

我们还买了几个可爱的男孩 不过…
We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...

你之前喜欢男孩吗? 
You did like boys before?

我压根没猜到 希望没有冒犯到你
I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.

但我也从未对女孩感兴趣过
But I was never interested in girls, either.

每个人都会有感兴趣的事
Everybody is interested in something.

我见识过欲望对人的影响 对国家的影响
When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country,

我很高兴我不会被它左右
I am very glad to have no part in it.

况且 欲望的缺失 让我有更多精力追寻其他事情
Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者'  御林铁卫队长

让我猜猜 我被赦免了
Let me guess, I've been pardoned.

好吧 可不能让父亲失望
Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.

我 拜拉席恩家族的
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,

安达尔人和先民的国王 暨七大王国的统治者 于此审判期间 将吾之位置
King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.

交于兰尼斯特家族的泰温 国王之手
Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King,

全境守护者 由其代行法官职务
Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.

马泰尔家族的奥柏伦亲王和 提利尔家族的梅斯大人为之辅弼
And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.

若罪名成立 愿诸神惩处
And if found guilty...  may the gods punish the accused.

兰尼斯特家族的提利昂 你被摄政太后指控弑君
Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.

是你杀害了乔佛里国王吗? 
Did you kill King Joffrey?

是你妻子珊莎女士干的吗? 
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

那你认为他是怎么死的? 
How would you say he died, then?

他是被鸽子馅饼噎死的
Choked on his pigeon pie.

依你之见 莫非是厨师所为? 
So you would blame the bakers?

要么是他们 要么是鸽子 反正怪不到我头上
Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.

传召第一位证人觐见
The crown may call its first witness.

当我们把乔佛里国王从暴民中安全救出时 小恶魔过来指责他
Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.

扇了国王一耳光 还说他是残暴的蠢蛋
He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.

这不是小恶魔第一次威胁乔佛里了
It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.

就在这个王座厅 他走上台阶 称我们的国王是个笨蛋
Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.

把陛下与疯王相提并论 并暗示陛下将会有同样的下场
Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate.

而当我出言维护国王时 他威胁要杀掉我
And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.

哦 那你怎么不说乔佛里都干了什么? 
Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?

安静 他拿一把装填好的十字弓对着珊莎・史塔克 而你则撕掉她的衣服 还殴打她
Silence. Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

除非我要求 否则你不得说话
You will not speak unless called upon.

你可以退下了 马林爵士
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

蛇蜥毒 寡妇之血 附子草 夜影之水精华 甜睡花 里斯之泪 鬼舞草… 瞎眼毒…
Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance...  blind eye--

大学士 我觉得你已经说明你的重点了
I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.

你存了很多的毒药
You have a lot of poison in your store.

我的储藏早已被洗劫一空了
My stores were plundered.

被告人 提利昂・兰尼斯特 在他以莫须有的罪名将我囚禁之后
By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.

大学士 你查验过乔佛里国王的尸体
Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse.

他是被毒杀的 这一点毫无疑问? 
Was it without question poison that killed him?

这是在国王的弄臣唐托斯・霍拉德 的尸体上发现的
This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.

人们最后看到他时 他正在怂恿被告人之妻 珊莎・史塔克逃离宴会
He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.

而她在婚礼当天 正是戴着这条项链
She wore this necklace the day of the wedding.

在其中发现了毒药残渣 一味极其罕见而恐怖的毒药
Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.

这味毒药是你被盗的储藏中的吗? 
Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?

是的 叫扼死者
It was. The Strangler.

这毒药在七大王国非常少见
A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.

它被用来杀死诸神赐给这片土地的 最高贵的孩子
And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.

'总有一天
'I will hurt you for this.

当你自以为平安快活时 喜乐会在嘴里化为灰烬 到那时候 你会明白债已偿还'
A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.'

你的亲弟弟这么对你说的? 
Your own brother said this to you?

就在黑水河之战不久前
Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

我因他将乔佛里推上前线的计划与他对峙
I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.

后来 当进攻来临时
As it turned out, when the attack came,

小乔坚持要留在城墙上
Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.

他坚信他的出现能鼓舞士气
He believed his presence would inspire the troops.

我发现他竟然在首相塔里 偷偷养了个妓女
I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.

而我早要求过他 此等淫荡恶习不应带出妓院
I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs.

谢谢你 陛下 谢谢你作证的勇气
Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.

你还准确的记得威胁的内容? 
Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?

我记得很清楚 大人
I'm afraid I do, my lord.

他说 '那你更应该对我礼貌一些
He said, 'Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.

怪物是很危险的 国王和蚊蝇在他眼里都一样'
Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.'

他是在御前会议上对你这么说的? 
And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?

在我们得知罗柏・史塔克的死讯之后
After we received word of Robb Stark's death.

他似乎对此并不感到高兴
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.

或许他与珊莎・史塔克的婚姻 使他对北境的事业更加同情
Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.

你可以退下了 瓦里斯大人
You're excused, Lord Varys.

父亲 我可以问这位证人一个问题吗? 
Father, may I ask the witness one question?

你曾说 如果没有我 这座城市将必然面临毁灭
You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.

你说过 历史永远不会提及我的名字 但你不会忘记我
You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget.

你忘了吗 瓦里斯大人? 
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

我没忘记过任何事情
I never forget a thing.

现在休庭
We will adjourn for now.

一小时后鸣钟继续
Toll the bells in an hour's time.

你要判自己的儿子死罪吗? 
You'd condemn your own son to death?

我谁也没判 审判还没结束
I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.

这不是什么审判 这是一出闹剧
This isn't a trial. It's a farce.

瑟曦操纵了一切 你知道的
Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.

我什么都不知道
I know nothing of the sort.

你一直讨厌提利昂 他杀了他的国王
You've always hated Tyrion. He killed his king.

你知道疯王最后给我的命令是什么吗? 
Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?

他要我献上你的脑袋
To bring him your head.

我救了你一命是为了让你来谋害我的弟弟吗? 
I saved your life so you could murder my brother?

那不是谋害 是正义  正义? 
It won't be murder. It'll be justice. Justice?

我恪守誓言履行御前首相的职责
I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.

若提利昂被认定有罪 他将受的刑罚将量罪而定
If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.

他会被处死 - 不 他将受应得之刑
He'll be executed. No, he'll be punished accordingly.

你曾经说过代代延续的是家族
Once you said family is what lives on.

你说你的王朝将存续千年
You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years.

如果提利昂死了你的王朝要怎么办? 
What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?

我是御林铁卫 誓言让我无法延续家族血脉
I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.

我很了解你的誓言
I'm well aware of your oath.

那你的姓氏怎么传承? 
What happens to your name?

谁将带着狮子的旗帜来加入以后的战斗? 
Who carries the lion banner into future battles?

还是那些我连名字都记不住的亲戚? 
Others whose names I don't even remember?

可如果我饶过了杀害我孙子的凶手 我的王朝又将如何呢? 
What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?

它将由我来延续
It survives through me.

我会解除御林铁卫的职务
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

我会做回你的儿子和继承人 只要你让提利昂活着
I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.

当证人发言完毕 法官们作出有罪判决后
When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered,

提利昂将获准发言
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.

他要乞求开恩 而我会允许他加入守夜人
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.

三天之内 他将被押往黑城堡 并在长城度过余生
In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall.

而你要立刻脱下白袍
You'll remove your white cloak immediately.

动身离开君临 前往凯岩城坐上属于你的位置
You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.

你要娶一位门当户对的姑娘 生下兰尼斯特的孩子
You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister.

并永远不再置你的家族于不顾
And you'll never turn your back on your family again.

不怎么顺利 对吧? 
Not going well, is it?

你会被判有罪 噢 你也这么认为? 
You're going to be found guilty. Oh, you think so?

当你被判罪的时候 你要好好求饶一番 恳求被发往长城
When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.

父亲会同意的
Father's agreed to it.

他会饶过你的性命 允许你加入守夜人
He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.

奈德・史塔克之前也这样被允诺过 你我都知道他的下场
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.

父亲不是乔佛里 他会信守诺言的
Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.

把嘴闭上 别再口不择言
Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.

这一切很快就会结束
This will all be over soon.

王座将召见下一位证人
The crown may call its next witness.

你是否以诸神之名 起誓所作证言真实而诚实? 
Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?

你认识这个人吗? 
Do you know this man?

认识 提利昂・兰尼斯特
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

我是她夫人珊莎小姐的侍女
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.

这个人被控谋杀乔佛里国王
This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.

对此你是否知情? 
What do you know of this?

据我所知他有罪
I know that he's guilty.

他与珊莎一起密谋
He and Sansa planned it together.

她想为父亲报仇 为她母亲 她哥哥报仇
She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.

她将他们的死归咎于国王
She blamed their deaths on the king.

提利昂很高兴能帮她
Tyrion was happy to help.

他恨乔佛里 他恨王后
He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.

他也恨您 大人
He hated you, my lord.

他从大学士的房间里偷了毒药 放进乔佛里的酒里
He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.

你怎么可能知道这些? 
How could you possibly know all this?

他怎么会把自己的计划向他老婆的侍女和盘托出? 
Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?

我不仅仅是她的侍女
I wasn't just her maid.

你说你是他的…
You said you were his...

你怎么跟他勾搭上的? 
How did you come to be in his service?

我当时和另一个男人在一起 那人是大人您的军队里的一位骑士
I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army.

但提利昂到营地以后 派了名杀手到我们的帐篷里去
But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.

他打断了那位骑士的胳膊 把我带到提利昂大人那里去了
He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.

'现在你是我的了,' 他这么说
'You belong to me now,' he said.

拿出世界末日的劲头来跟他做爱
Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.

他要的我都照办了
I did everything he wanted.

无论他要我对他做什么
Whatever he told me to do to him.

不管他想对我做什么
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

他要我亲哪里我就亲哪里
I kissed him where he wanted.

他要我舔哪里我就舔哪里
I licked him where he wanted.

他要干哪里我就让他干哪里
I let him put himself where he wanted.

我曾在他房间里一等就是好几个小时 只为他无聊的时候能享用我
I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.

他要我叫他'我的雄狮' 我照办了
He ordered me to call him 'my lion,' so I did.

我用手捧起他的脸 说道
I took his face in my hands and said,

那是他跟珊莎成婚之前的事了
That was before he married Sansa.

在那之后 他只想要她
After that, all he wanted was her.

但她不肯让他上床
But she wouldn't let him into her bed.

于是他允诺要为她杀了乔佛里
So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.

我… 认罪
I wish... to confess.

我拯救过这座城市 和你们无聊的生命
I saved this city and all your worthless lives.

我该让史坦尼斯把你们全杀了
I should have let Stannis kill you all.

你要认罪吗? 
Do you wish to confess?

认罪 那不正是你想听到的吗? 
Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?

你承认自己毒害国王? 
You admit you poisoned the king?

不 关于乔佛里的死我是清白的
No, of that I'm innocent.

我犯的是更为可怕的罪
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.

我的罪是生为侏儒
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

这不是一场对侏儒的审判
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

我的人生就是一场对侏儒的审判
I've been on trial for that my entire life.

你没有为自己辩护的吗? 
Have you nothing to say in your defense?

我没杀乔佛里 但现在希望是自己干的
I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.

看着你那恶毒的小杂种死去 比一千个躺好的妓女都更让我开心
Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.

我希望自己真的是你们想象中的怪物
I wish I was the monster you think I am.

我希望自己备下足够的毒药来对付你们所有人
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.

我会非常开心地看着你们所有人把它咽下去 哪怕赔上自己的性命
I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.

马林爵士 马林爵士
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

把犯人押回牢房
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

我不会因乔佛里的死而送掉自己的性命
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.

而在这里却得不到正义
And I know I'll get no justice here.

所以我要让上天诸神裁决我的命运
So I will let the gods decide my fate.

我要求比武审判
I demand a trial by combat

我跟他们妥协才让你那忘恩负义的脑袋 和不知感恩的脖子暂时不至于分家
I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.

抱歉 那我该感激咯? 
I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?

感激我因为莫须有的罪名 而被发配到长城孤独终老? 
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者'  御林铁卫队长

是你不想活了 你自己找死
You threw your life away. You threw it away.

这不是个玩笑 你明白吗? 
It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?

这当然是个玩笑 只是不怎么好笑罢了
Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one.

我听不下去了 听她站在那里满嘴谎言
I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies.

你爱上了个妓女
You fell in love with a whore.

对 我爱上了个妓女
Yes, I fell in love with a whore.

还傻乎乎地以为她也爱上了我
And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.

你做的妥协 正是父亲想要的
That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted.

他重新让你成了继承人
He gets you back as his heir.

未来的凯岩城公爵
The future Lord of the Rock.

还把我送去黑城堡 让我终于可以滚出他的视线
And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last.

让他落得一场空的感觉真好
It felt good to take that from him.

他明知我是无辜的却还是决定牺牲我
He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

他愿意牺牲我们任何人
He's willing to sacrifice any of us.

你是他金光灿灿的儿子
You're the golden son.

你可以杀掉国王 可以没了右手 还可以操自己的亲姐姐 不管发生什么你都是金光灿灿的儿子
You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.

我是你最后的朋友了
I'm the last friend you've got.

至少我当面揭露了他们的真面目
At least I got to tell them what they really are.

是啊 精彩的演讲
Yes, brilliant speech.

他们会议论这事好久
They'll be talking about it for days to come.

我还以为你是个现实主义者
I thought you were a realist.

没想到你竟会死于骄傲
Didn't realize you'd die for pride.

别急着现在就放弃我
Don't give up on me just yet.

上次比武审判没有你救我 我还活下来了呢
I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.

这次我也救不了你
I can't save you this time either.

训练证明 我用左手连个马僮都打不过
My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.

你的闯劲都哪去了? 
Where's your sense of adventure?

就算你输了 想象一下父亲的表情吧
Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.

一剑下去 我们家族的英名就毁于一旦
Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.

波隆曾为我而战 这次他也会的
Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again.

我觉得欠他的债 这辈子怕是还不清了
I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.

你会帮我去找他吗? 
Will you find him for me?

瑟曦打算派谁出战? 
Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion?

我希望是马林・特兰爵士
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

我会很高兴地看着波隆把那傲慢无礼 欺负小孩的家伙开膛破肚
I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.

格雷果爵士 欢迎来到君临
Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital.

多谢你这么快就赶来了
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

你看起来状态不错
You seem to be in good form.

你不该这样坐在外面的
You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.

我想回自己的小屋去 但伤得太重了
Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much.

后来我想起他们烧了我的小屋
Then I remembered they burned my hut down.

我早就不多问了
I stopped asking a while ago.

这伤好不了的
That's not gonna get better.

你还没受够吗? 
Haven't you had enough?

自行了断
Take matters into my own hands.

我想过的
The thought has occurred to me.

没什么比这个更糟了
Nothing could be worse than this.

什么都没了也许更糟
Maybe nothing is worse than this.

没了就是没了
Nothing isn't better or worse than anything.

也就无所谓糟不糟了
Nothing is just nothing.

带她去姨妈那换赎金
Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.

是啊 公平交易
A fair exchange, that is.

我做每一笔生意的时候都想着 要公平交易
Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings.

人弃我取 人取我予
You give me, I give you.

我能喝点什么吗? 
Could I have a drink?

死亡是件让人口渴的事
Dying is thirsty work.

这是心脏的位置
That's where the heart is.

你要这样杀人
That's how you kill a man.

有人高价买你的人头
There's a price on your head.

看来让国王滚蛋就得摊上这事
Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.

他在婚礼上喝了毒酒
He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.

悬赏你是因为你杀了兰尼斯特家的士兵
The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.

而你觉得自己能领到赏? 
And you thought you were going to collect it?

不会用脑子 是吧
Didn't think very hard, did you?

尤伦带我去长城的时候 你是他的囚犯之一
You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.

他说他要用根棍子狠狠操我
He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.

今天并没有你计划的那么顺利
This day's really not working out the way you planned.

他在你的小名单上吗? 
He on your little list?

我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

游骑兵归来! 欢迎
Rangers returning! Greetings.

以为再也见不到你了
Didn't think I'd see you again.

葛兰
'笨牛' 守夜人游骑兵

欢迎归来 兄弟
Welcome back, brother.

这儿没有这野东西的地方
This is no place for wild beasts.

把它锁起来 要不我就让哈布把它扔进今晚的烩菜里
Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.

我们离开时 曼斯的大军正逼近卡斯特的城堡
Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left.

我们从欧斯里克山上望见了他们的营火
We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.

他们将在下次月圆前抵达长城
They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.

我很惊讶你居然没有骑过去打个招呼
I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello.

塞外之王是你的老朋友 对吗? 
The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?

我们早就已经开始准备了
We've been preparing.

我们应该封锁隧道
We should seal the tunnel.

把它用石头和冰块堵起来
Plug it with rocks and ice.

并浇上水使它冻结
Flood it and let it freeze.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

派普尔
'派普' 守夜人

那我们怎么巡逻长城以北呢? 
And how would we range north?

我们不去 懦夫
We wouldn't.  Coward.

你要我们自断双腿 自毁双目 蜷缩在长城后面哆哆嗦嗦 祈祷风暴过去吗? 
You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?

我们无法在十万敌军的围攻下守住城门
We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men.

这座城堡已屹立了几千年
This castle has stood for thousands of years.

守夜人守卫了它几千年
The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years.

几个世纪以来 我们从未封锁过隧道
And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.

你见过巨人吗 艾里沙爵士? 
Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?

隧道的大门挡不住他们
The tunnel's gate won't stop them

大门的铁栏足有四尺厚
The bars on those gates are four inches thick.

那挡不住他们
They won't stop them.

告诉我你是属于哪个部门的 雪诺大人
Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.

事务官负责维护隧道吗? 
Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?

工匠 啊 工匠
The builders. Ah, the builders.

首席工匠亚威克
First Builder Yarwyck,

雪诺大人提议封锁隧道 让我们无法尽忠职守 履行身为守夜人兄弟的誓言
Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.

你赞同他吗? 
Do you agree with him?

鉴于你对野人大军的渊博学识 雪诺大人 你和塔利从今天起每晚都要上长城守夜 直到满月
Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.

山姆威尔・塔利
'杀手' 守夜人事务官

首席工匠 我们需要运一百桶沥青上长城
First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.

你穿了身新衣服
You have new clothes.

比处女的大腿还柔软呢
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

我几天前就召唤你了
I sent for you days ago.

我最近可有点忙 忙着做什么? 
I've been a bit busy. Doing what?

我可悲的单身汉生活即将结束啦
My lonesome bachelor days are over.

我将迎娶洛丽丝・史铎克渥斯女士
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

我可不觉得她合你的口味
She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

我不只喜欢一种口味的女人
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

我想要天才 就该娶你了
If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

当我姐姐促成这场基于真爱的婚姻时 她是否提过洛丽丝还有个姐姐呢? 
When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?

哦 我知道她有个姐姐呢
Aye, I did know about the older sister.

你也明白继承权的规矩? 
And you understand the rules of inheritance?

法丽丝已经 40 了 而且没有生育能力
Falyse is 40 and barren.

当她父亲死时 她仍然将继承史铎克渥斯家的城堡
She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.

除非她比她父亲更早升天
Unless she happens to perish before her father.

那城堡就是洛丽丝的了
Then Lollys gets the castle.

这又怎么了? 女士们常常 从马上摔下来 跌断她们的小细脖子
What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.

你和我姐姐还真是绝配呀
You and my sister deserve each other.

那你何必还要到这儿来呢? 
Why did you bother to come here?

你曾说过如果任何人让我出卖你 你都会出双倍的价钱
You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.

你想要两个妻子还是两座城堡? 
Is it two wives you want or two castles?

只是要我帮你杀了魔山 这城堡非得是个了不起的大家伙
But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.

眼下我无法提供城堡
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.

但你可以得到我的金子和谢意
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

我拿你的谢意来做什么呢? 
What can I buy with gratitude?

兰尼斯特有债必还
You might be surprised.

总有一天我会报答你
A Lannister always pays his debts.

你姐姐也是个兰尼斯特呢
Your sister's a Lannister, too.

我妻子是临冬城的继承人
My wife is heir to Winterfell.

只要能安然度过此次危机
If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders,

总有一天我将以她的名义统治北境
I may one day rule the North in her name.

我可以让你分一大杯羹
I could carve you out a big piece of it.

只要 总有一天 到时候
If and may and could.

北地实在太他妈的冷
It's bloody cold up north.

洛丽丝却是暖和柔软
Lollys is soft and warm.

要是我让你选择是跟洛丽丝上床 还是跟魔山打架 只怕连眼都不眨 你就已经脱掉内裤 掏出鸡巴了
If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.

你这么怕他? 
Does he frighten you so much?

不怕他才怪 你当我是白痴? 
I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.

他壮得惊人 臂力无穷
He's freakish big and freakish strong.

就一个那般体格的人而言 他的速度已经够可怕了
And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size.

也许我能赢 一直围着他转圈 引诱其发力攻击 直到他连剑也举不动为止 最后再展开反扑 废掉他的腿
Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow.

我凭什么去冒险? 
Why should I risk it?

就凭你是我的朋友
Because you're my friend.

对 我是你的朋友
Aye, I'm your friend.

可你什么时候为我冒过生命危险呀? 
And when have you ever risked your life for me?

我喜欢你 你这个骄纵的小混蛋
I like you, pampered little shit that you are.

只是我更爱我自己
I just like myself more.

对不起我只能这么做
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

只因为你是个坏家伙 没良心也没同情心? 
Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart?

这正是我最欣赏你的地方
That's what I liked about you in the first place.

我们有过一段好日子
We had some good days together.

我想我只能亲自出马宰了魔山
I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.

这难道不该被写成一首伟大的歌谣吗? 
Won't that make for a great song?

我希望有一天能听到那首歌
I hope to hear them sing it one day.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

你怎么进来的? 
How did you get in here?

您的门口戒备森严 可没人看守窗户
Your door is well guarded, but your window is not.

我游到一里外的小岛上采到了这束花
I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.

我还从未见过不爱野花的女人呢
Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.

这是我的私人宅邸
These are my private quarters.

如果我想见你 我会传唤你的
If I want you here, I will summon you.

对不起 女王大人 我就是为了侍奉您而生的
Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.

告诉我你为何而来
Tell me why you're here.

我有一个小小的请求
I came to ask a favor.

我在这世上只有两种才能… 战争和女人
I only have two talents in this world-- war and women.

您在弥林逗留 统治这里
You are staying here in Meereen to rule.

这是个明智的选择 我万分赞同
That is a wise decision. I respect it.

然而在弥林 我无法施展我的才华
But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.

我已命令次子团巡逻街道 防止仇杀
I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.

您的命令把我们变成了哨兵
You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

至于女人 弥林有成千上万的女人 可以供你施展自己的才华
And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.

只有一位女性能令我心醉神迷 可她却对我不理不睬
There is only one, and she does not want me.

你已向我效忠
You swore me your sword.

我的剑至死都属于您
My sword is yours till the day I die.

所以如果我命令你继续留在弥林 巡视街道? 
So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?

那我就留在弥林 继续巡视街道
I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.

请派我去剿灭您的敌人们
Send me to kill your enemies.

请让我发挥我的才能
Let me do what I do best.

脱了你的衣服吧
Take off your clothes.

王后大人 请进
Come in, my queen. Please.

女士 我不想打扰您
I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.

您的造访永远不算打扰
You could never disturb me.

我只是想在我们离开之前和您谈一谈
I just wanted to speak with you before we left.

请您帮我拿一下那边的小瓶好吗? 
Could you bring me that vial over there?

不不不 不是那一瓶
No, no, no. Not that one.

那一瓶我建议您碰都不要碰
You don't even want to touch that one.

我今早观察火焰时 光之王对我说
When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me.

也许这并不那么可笑
Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

很好笑 只是我… 我并不擅长幽默
It was. I-- humor isn't my strength.

那是因为大部分笑话都是谎言 而你一心一意只追求真相
That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.

如果它们都是谎言 夫人 不应当设法远离它们吗? 
If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?

这些粉末与药剂 大多都是谎言
Most of these powders and potions are lies.

诱使人们相信他们目睹了光之王神迹的谎言
Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power.

一旦他们进入了它的光芒里 他们就将意识到这些谎言的真面目… 谎言只是引领人们接近真理的小把戏
Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth.

在篝火中放一点点这种粉末 会引发一条火蛇嚎叫着冲向天空
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.

这种粉末会制造黑色的烟雾 把最勇敢的男子汉都吓得尿裤子
And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.

只要在任何男人的酒中滴一点这个 就将使他为情欲痴狂
And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.

你在史坦尼斯身上用过这个吗? 
Did you use it with Stannis?

男人们从不渴望他们已经拥有的东西
Men never crave what they already have.

本能的需求
It needs what it needs.

只要是为了光之王 一切行为都不是罪孽
No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin.

每天我都感谢真神将你带给我们
I thank God every day for bringing you to us.

他想把希琳也带上
He wants to bring Shireen with us.

我认为那可能并不是个好主意
I think that would be ill-advised.

也许你注意到了 我们的女儿有异教徒倾向
My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware.

我不确定她是否真心怀疑真神 抑或她只是希望与我做对 不过无论如何 她都最好留在家里
I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.

我理解你的考虑
I understand how you feel.

但这不可能
But that is impossible.

您根本不需要粉末或者药剂 王后陛下
You don't need powders and potions, my queen.

您的信仰已足够坚定 足以自行在光之王的圣火中看到真相
You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.

尽管对我们来说很难解读
However hard for us to understand.

您也并不需要我的协助 但我很快就需要您的帮助
You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon.

我们起航时 需要带上您的女儿希琳公主一起
When we set sail, your daughter must be with us.

你是来觐见女王陛下的吗?
Are you here to see our queen?

她现在心情很好
She's in a good mood.

你终于来了 比某人来得晚
You're here early. Later than some.

这并不是关乎于赞同 而是关乎于信任
It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.

你既不赞同我也不信任我
You neither approve nor trust.

我又能做什么? 他是雇佣兵
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

在你对我哥哥宣誓效忠以前 你不是也曾受雇于黄金团吗?
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?

达里奥・纳哈里斯杀了另外两名团长 把他们的人头抛在您脚下 仅仅是因为他厌倦了听令于他们
Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.

您怎么能信任那种人?
How could you ever have faith in a man like that?

我从未信任过他
I could never have faith in a man like Daario.

所以我才把他派往次子团 协同收复渊凯
That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

您不在那里统治 卡丽熙
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,

我担心善主们只是在那里等待时机 等待入侵者离开就重夺渊凯控制权
I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.

所以我才命令达里奥处决渊凯善主 不放过任何一个
That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.

善主们将婴儿从母亲的怀里夺走 生生撕裂
The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms.

将成千上万的小男孩肢解
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

把小女孩培养成妓院里取悦老男人的玩物
They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.

他们把人当畜生 你也说过
They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.

把善主们囚禁起来 然后成批地屠宰 这同样是把人当畜生
Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts.

您解放的那些奴隶 他们只懂野蛮暴虐
The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known.

若是想教化他们 只能树立榜样 以身作则
If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.

那奴隶贩子又该得到什么? 仁慈? 
And repay the slaves with what? Kindness?

罚款? 口头警告? 
A fine? A stern warning?

把您的所有敌人都视为邪恶的 的确很便捷 但在战争中 善与恶是并存的
It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.

让牧师们去讨论善恶吧
Let the priests argue over good and evil.

我有能力推翻它 我就要这么做
I can end it. I will end it.

幕后的势力我也会一并推翻
And I will end those behind it.

我也曾贩奴 卡丽熙
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

而你现在要做的是帮我解放他们
And now you are helping me show them to freedom.

要是奈德・史塔克对我也像您对待渊凯的善主那样 我就没机会在这里协助您了
I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.

那人第二天就来觐见我 商议厚葬他的父亲
The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.

他会协同次子团 然后作为我的使节前往渊凯
He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.

他会告诉善主们弥林发生的一切
He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.

并让善主们认清形势
He will explain the choice they have before them.

要么在我建立的新世界里生存 要么就只能跟着旧世界一起灭亡
They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.

对了 达里奥走前让他来见我
Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.

告诉他我改主意了
Tell him I changed my mind.

告诉他是你使我改主意了
Tell him you changed my mind.

你不该那样清理伤口
You're doing it wrong.

这么严重的咬伤应该用火烧
You need to burn away that horrible bit there.

否则会感染化脓
Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.

我知道你不喜欢火 但你这么做是不行的 --
I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right--

就一眨眼的事儿
It'll only take a second.

不会很疼的 别过来!
It won't hurt that much. No fire!

什么都别提了
Shut up about everything.

多亏了你 如今我变成了活钱袋 到哪儿都能看着兰尼斯特家的人
Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.

在哪儿哪儿被围堵 去哪儿哪儿都被阻截
Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.

我比村里被你捅死那只猪还蠢 被切被刺被啃
I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.

给我多少钱我都不愿干这破事
No reward is worth this much trouble.

我要是从没注意过你就好了
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

你说过你哥给了你那把剑
You say your brother gave you that sword.

我哥却烧了我的脸
My brother gave me this.

就像你说的 是挺久以前了
It was just like you said a while back.

他把我的脸按进燃烧的火盆 就像一块多汁的羊排
Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

他以为我偷了他的玩具
Thought I stole one of his toys.

我没偷 我只是拿着玩儿
I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it.

最可怕的是 是我的亲哥哥这么对我的
But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.

我爸还为他撑腰 对别人说是我床单着了火
My father, who protected him...  told everyone my bedding caught fire.

你以为只有你是孑然一身?
You think you're on your own?

我来帮你洗净伤口吧 而且无论如何得帮你缝上
Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.

稍微犒劳下自己无伤大雅
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

我们在沟里呆了好几个星期了
We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.

就睡一晚羽毛床吧 你也不用做饭了
I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.

完全同意 小姐
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

别期待有丝质睡衣就好
Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.

我可没你以前的主人那么阔绰
Not working for your former lord any longer.

是的 小姐  别喝多了
Yes, my lady. Don't get drunk.

还需要点其他的吗?
Can I get you anything else?

这些就很好了 谢谢
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

腰子派很好吃
Kidney pie is wonderful.

腰子派美味的秘诀在于材料
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.

面粉 猪油 水 鸡蛋 牛奶
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

都很简单 但肉的选取就讲究了 时机是否合适 得把手放在一块上好的牛后腿肉上才能判断 而选取牛犊的腰子也是技术活
Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy.

我是说 有些人用普通的老腰子来做派
I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.

这样的人什么菜都做不好
Got no right to cook anything, them.

说起卤汁我就激动
Don't get me started on the gravy.

很难做好
Very difficult to get right.

很多人就是因为做不好卤汁才放弃做派的
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.

这可不能放弃啊
You cannot give up on the gravy.

铠甲不错 您是一名骑士吗?
That's nice armor. Are you a knight?

哦 我还以为穿着铠甲的都是骑士
Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights.

一般都是这样的 你们是从君临来的吧? 
Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you?

我老家就是君临跳蚤窝
From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred.

什么风把你们吹到这儿来了? 
What brings you to these parts?

我们在找人
We're looking for someone.

那人有什么特征? 也许来过这里
Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here.

很多人都来这里 昨天我们还有 17 个 --
A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17--

一个女孩 高挑 红发 很漂亮
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

她叫珊莎・史塔克 但可能用的是化名
Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.

哪个史塔克家族 临冻城的吗?
What, like them lot from 'Winterhell'?

没 从没见过
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

我听说他们是叛徒
I heard they was all traitors.

这儿可不欢迎叛徒
Don't need no traitors in here.

我以性命向他们的母亲 凯特琳・史塔克起誓
I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.

我发誓我会带她的女儿们回家
I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.

还想再来点儿腰子派吗? 
Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

没什么 小姐
It's nothing, my lady.

没什么说的你脸就不会拧成那样啦
You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.

我无意冒犯 小姐 真的没什么
Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.

你还没好看到能冒犯我呢
You're not interesting enough to be offensive.

兰尼斯特家族的人想要珊莎小姐
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

兰尼斯特家族很有钱
The Lannisters have money.

人们为了钱什么都干得出来
People kill for money.

我觉得我们不该向其他人透露 我们在找珊莎夫人这件事
I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.

小姐 大人 我能说句话吗?
My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?

你想说什么? 不要腰子派了
What about? Not kidney pie.

您看起来是位正派的小姐
You seem like a proper lady.

可以信赖
Someone who could be trusted.

我的确没见过珊莎・史塔克
I never met no Sansa Stark.

但我认识她妹妹
But I know her sister...

艾莉亚・史塔克的父亲被处决后 她就不见踪影了
No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.

我上次跟她说话时她还没死
She weren't when I last spoke to her.

什么时候?  跟着守夜人北上时
When was that? Heading up north with the Night's Watch.

和您一样 她打扮得像个男孩子
She was all dressed up as a boy.

只是您比她多了铠甲
Like your ladyship, only without the armor.

她化名为阿利
Going by the name Arry.

她怎么了? 这个嘛 --
So what happened to her? Well--

兰尼斯特家族的人抓住了我们
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

兄弟会的人又抓住了我们
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.

把我卖到了旅店
They sold me to the innkeep.

他们本打算带艾莉亚・史塔克去奔流城找她妈妈换赎金 跟关着的另一个人一起
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.

又高又丑 满嘴脏话 脸长得像烧焦一半的火腿
Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.

满脸凶相  猎狗
Not friendly. The Hound.

如果你们找到她 能把这个给她吗? 
If you find her, could you give her this?

她很喜欢我之前给她的那个 但这个做得更好
She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.

她失去了母亲 外公也去世了
Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead,

瓦德・佛雷成了新的奔流城主
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.

兄弟会不会去奔流城的
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

他们应该是带着她去鹰巢城了 小姐
They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

她的姨妈 莱莎・艾林
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

凯特琳・史塔克的妹妹
Catelyn Stark's sister.

她是艾莉亚唯一在世而且有钱的亲人
She's Arya's last living relative with money.

她恨兰尼斯特家族的人
She hates the Lannisters.

提利昂大人让我记住了 各个家族的结亲跟结仇的情况
Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.

珊莎没准也在那里
Sansa could be there, too.

奥柏伦・马泰尔
'红毒蛇' 多恩亲王

我还以为您这会儿已经回妓院了
I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

我昨天还真跟个绝对正点的金发妞玩儿了会儿
I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

这地方真是啥垃圾都有 就是没我喜欢的
I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.

瑟曦召见了我
Cersei approached me.

我们谈了很多关于她女儿的事情
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

她很担心她的女儿
How worried your sister is about her.

她竭力掩饰 假装她不是来让我反对你的
She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you.

我想也许她自己都这么认为
I think she may have even believed it herself.

假意吐露真情来达到欺骗的目的 这是她的惯用伎俩之一
Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.

她很难掩饰自己的真实意图
It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.

很少遇到一位兰尼斯特家的人 像我一样对弄死兰尼斯特家的人如此热心
It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.

她巴不得看到你死
She desperately wants to see you killed.

她不用劳驾您
She didn't need to bother you.

看起来这事由我自己解决就行了
It looks as though I've taken care of that myself.

当我人头落地时 她会无比开心
The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck.

她早就盼着这一刻了
She's wanted this for a long time.

如果见过 我会记得的
I think I would have remembered that.

不可能 你刚刚出生
Unlikely. You had just been born.

我父亲带着我和姐姐伊莉亚 一起造访凯岩城
Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.

那是我第一次离开多恩
My first time away from Dorne.

我一点也不喜欢凯岩城
I didn't like anything about the Rock.

讨厌那里的食物 天气 还有你们的口音
Not the food, not the weather, not your accents.

而最让我失望的 是你
But the biggest disappointment...  you.

您家族和我家族的共同点比你们愿意承认的要多
You and my family have more in common than you might admit.

从多恩过来 一路上 听到的话题全是那个怪物 泰温・兰尼斯特刚出生的儿子
The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister.

头有两个身体那么大 两腿间长着一根尾巴 还有爪子 一只眼睛是红色的 不仅有男人的命根子 还有女子的阴道
A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.

那可就省却不少烦恼
That would have made things so much easier.

当我们见到你姐姐时 她答应一定会满足我们的好奇心
When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us.

我们每天都问
Every day we would ask.

每天她都说'快了'
Every day she would say, 'Soon.'

后来她和你哥哥 带我们去你的婴儿室 她向我们展示了怪物
Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and...  she unveiled the freak.

你的头有点大
Your head was a bit large.

你的胳膊和腿有点小 但没爪子
Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw.

没红眼睛 两腿之间没有尾巴
No red eye. No tail between your legs.

只有一个粉红的小命根子
Just a tiny pink cock.

我们没打算掩饰自己的失望
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.

'那不是个怪物' 我对瑟曦说
'That's not a monster,' I told Cersei.

她回答 '他杀了我妈妈'
And she said, 'He killed my mother.'

然后用力拧你的小命根子
And she pinched your little cock so hard,

像要把它扯下来
I thought she might pull it off.

直到你哥哥让她住手
Until your brother made her stop.

'有什么关系' 她对我们说
'It doesn't matter,' she told us.

'大家都说他活不长
'Everyone says he will die soon.

我希望他们说的是对的
I hope they are right.

他早该死了'
He should not have lived this long.'

哎 瑟曦迟早会得到她想要的
Well...  sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.

那我想要的怎么办? 
And what about what I want?

正义 为了我姐姐和她的孩子们
Justice for my sister and her children.

如果你想要正义 你来错了地方
If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.

我来对了
I've come to the perfect place.

我想要将那些伤害我的人绳之以法
I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.

那些伤害我的人全在这里
And all those who have wronged me are right here.

我会先从格雷果・克里冈爵士开始 他杀了我姐姐的孩子们 然后就着满手鲜血强奸了她 最后又杀了她
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too.

我会做你的代理骑士
I will be your champion.

我在搭建我的家 临冬城
I'm building my home, Winterfell.

至少我是这么认为的
At least I think I am.

我很久没有回到那里了
I haven't been back there in a very long time.

我一直待在鹰巢城
I stay here in the Eyrie.

母亲说路上危险 我得保证自己的安全 因为我是谷地守护者 谷地守护者是一个非常重要的人物
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.

是的 你当然是
Yes, you certainly are.

你什么时候回家?
When will you go back?

我的家人不住在那里了 它被烧毁了
My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.

临冬城有月门吗?
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

临冬城不在山上 是在平地上
It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.

听起来很危险
That sounds dangerous.

那你们怎么让人飞? 我们不会
How do you make people fly? We don't.

那你们怎么处置那些不好的人 可怕的人和讨厌的人?
What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?

我从不处置他们
I never did anything with them at all.

在我们那儿 女孩不会参与这些事
Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.

我是谷地守护者
Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.

等我长大了 谁敢烦我 我就让谁飞
When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.

或者烦你的人 等我们结婚以后 如果你讨厌谁 可以告诉我 咱就给他们带到这儿来
Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh!

嗖地一声从月门飞出去
Right through the Moon Door.

听起来不错
I like the sound of that.

让我们在你的临冬城里搭建一座月门
Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

可以建在这个高塔里
It can go in here in this big tower.

小心 你毁了它
Careful. You've ruined it.

现在我要整个儿重新搭建了
Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.

不是我毁的 是你
I didn't ruin it. You did.

早就毁了 因为它没有月门
It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door.

把东西推倒可不是修理
Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

而是毁了它 不是我毁的!
It's ruining them. I didn't ruin it!

你在犯傻气 不是我毁的!
You're being stupid. I didn't ruin it!

罗宾 我很抱歉 我 --
Robin, I'm sorry, I--

培提尔・贝里席
'小指头' 赫伦堡公爵

我打了他 是的 我看到了
I hit him. Yes, I saw.

我不该那么做
I shouldn't have done that.

不 他母亲该这么做 早该这么做
No, his mother should have a long time ago.

就把它当成正确的一步
Consider it a step in the right direction.

如果他告诉莱莎姨妈...
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

让我来操心莱莎姨妈
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

我想记起临冬城是什么样的
I was trying to remember what everything looked like.

我永远也见不到它了
I'll never see it again.

在现在和永远不之间 有无尽的可能
A lot can happen between now and never.

如果你想建造一个更好的家 首先你必须推倒旧家
If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.

你杀死乔佛里的真正原因是什么?
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

我比你想象的更爱你母亲
I loved your mother more than you could ever know.

如果有机会 对于那些伤害了我们所爱的人 我们该怎么对付他们?
Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love?

在一个更好的世界里 一个爱能战胜 力量和职责的世界里 你也许是我的孩子
In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child.

但我们并未生在那样的世界里
But we don't live in that world.

你比当年的她更美
You're more beautiful than she ever was.

你想见我 莱莎姨妈?
You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

你知道从这里掉下去有多高吗?
Do you know how far the fall is?

我也不知道到底有多高
Neither do I, precisely.

很有趣 从这么高的地方掉下去 落到石头上后尸体会怎么样
It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height.

冲击力会把他们摔得粉碎
The impact breaks them right apart.

就像鸡蛋掉到地上
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

有些尸块会保持完整
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

你会发现一颗头在那里
You'll find the head sitting on its own.

蓝眼睛空洞无物
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

我很抱歉 莱莎姨妈
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

我知道我不该打罗宾 我保证不会有下次了 --
I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen--

别跟我忸怩作态 小婊子
Don't be coy with me, you little whore.

你吻了他 你吻了培提尔
You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.

我没有 你没明白 我看见你了
I didn't. You don't understand. I saw you.

你别想说谎 我亲眼看见的
You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.

他吻了我 我推开了 骗子!
He kissed me. I pulled away. Liar!

我父亲 我丈夫 我姐姐 他们都妨碍了我们 现在他们全死了
My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead.

妨碍我和培提尔的人就是这个下场
That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me.

往下看! 往下看! 往下看!
Look down! Look down! Look down!

这个又蠢又笨的孩子?
This empty-headed child?

她和她妈一样 她永远不会爱你的
She's just like her mother. She'll never love you.

你为什么要带她来这里? 为什么?
Why did you bring her here? Why?

我向诸神发誓
I swear to all the gods.

我可爱又无知的老婆
My sweet, silly wife.

我只爱过一个女人...  我一生中 只爱过一个
I have only loved one woman...  only one, my entire life.

这个调子你每次都他妈的猜错
Same wrong guess every fucking time.

总算有个带耳朵的
There's a man with an ear.

可惜你的鸡巴只有指甲刺儿那么大
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.

第一次看到你脱裤子的时候
First time I saw you with your breeches down,

我以为你是个太监
I thought you were a eunuch.

你们都见过的 姑娘们
You've seen it, girls.

就像刚从壳里钻出来的小蜗牛
Like a baby snail peeking out of his shell.

你的孩子早上一直在哭
Your baby was crying this morning.

那好 有什么想说的? 
Well, got anything to say?

我很抱歉 他把你吵醒了
I'm sorry he woke you up.

老娘不稀罕你的抱歉
I don't care if you're sorry.

你不让他安静点 我可动手了
Keep that baby quiet or I will.

你不许碰他
Don't you ever touch him.

野人的小婊子
Little wildling bitch.

你应该和你的同类待在一起
You should have stayed with your own kind.

闭嘴   你说什么? 
Shut your mouth.  What?

所以就心安理得了? 黑杰克和木桶还有 穆利活该被砍成碎片 因为他们没遵守命令? 
So it's all right, then? Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?

我不是这个意思
I didn't say it was all right.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

我是说他们不该在那儿
I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.

我们曾发誓要保卫百姓们的领土
We're pledged to guard the realms of men.

因为我 她死了
She's dead because of me.

我们居然连鼹鼠村都保卫不了
We can't even guard Mole's Town.

我们不能去追击他们 你明白的
We can't go after them. You know that.

就好像是我亲手割断了他们的脖子
As if I cut their throat myself.

也许她藏起来了
Maybe she managed to hide herself.

之前我也以为你们都死了
I thought all of you was dead.

你们和莫尔蒙一起去了北方 一个都没回来
You went north with Mormont and no one came back.

她在卡斯特手上活了下来 他是我见过的最恶心的狗屎
She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met.

她在去长城的长途跋涉中活了下来
She survived the long march to the Wall.

她还竟然他妈的从异鬼手上活了下来
She survived a white walker, for fuck's sake.

If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next.

曼斯和他的军队肯定就在附近
Mance and his army must be close.

我们还剩多少 一百零五个?

一百零二个人要怎么阻挡十万大军? 
How do 102 men stop 100,000?

活到最后的那个 行行好 把我们都烧了吧

要是我和这个世界说拜拜了
Once I'm done with this world,

我可不想再回来
I don't want to come back.

Well, I don't see why it matters.

灰虫子不会有兴趣的

无垢者不在乎我们衣服下面是什么

你还记得自己出生时的名字么? 
Do you remember the name you were given at birth?

他们什么时候阉你的 你还记得么? 
When they cut you, do you remember that?

他们对你做了那种事 我感到抱歉
I'm sorry they did that to you.

对男孩做这种事太残忍了
It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

如果奴隶主们没阉了我
If the masters never cut me,

我就当不成无垢者
I never am Unsullied.

'风暴降生'丹妮莉丝下令杀奴隶主们的时候 我就不会站在骄傲广场
I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters.

我就不会被选为无垢者的首领
I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.

对不起 我 为今天的事

只要呆在海里它们就很强
Strong as long as they're in the sea.

一旦从水里出来 因为没有骨头
When you take them out of the water, no bones.

它们引以为傲的重量会把它们压垮 塌成一堆废物
They collapse under their proud weight and slump into a heap of nothing.

你以为它们明白这点
You'd think they know that.

但很不幸 它们没那么聪明
Unfortunately, they're not very bright.

你打算对他们说什么? 
What do you tell them?

我是席恩・葛雷乔伊 巴隆之子 铁群岛的继承人

那你到底是个什么东西?   我是臭佬

你看起来很像个领主

记住你是谁 你不是谁
Remember what you are and what you're not.

把卡林湾献给我
Bring me Moat Cailin.

我是肯宁 这个要塞的指挥官
I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison.

你说你是席恩・葛雷乔伊? 
And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?

我为什么要信你? 
And why should I believe that?

我生在派克岛上 是巴隆・葛雷乔伊的儿子
I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.

他的三子 也是唯一还活着的儿子

我向淹神发誓

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

既然你是我的王子 为什么你和波顿的军队在一起? 
And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?

临冬城一役后 波顿大人俘虏了我
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.

他派我来和你们诚心诚意的谈判 和你们这些铁民
He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn.

波顿大人想要干嘛? 
And what does Lord Bolton want?

你们在疾病中渐渐消亡 你们严重短兵缺将 而且你们离海太远
You are fading from sickness, you are badly outnumbered, and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

波顿大人请求你们保护好自己的人 放弃这座守不住的堡垒
Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.

只要你们答应 他就会公平公正地对待你们 就像对我那样
Do this, and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me.

波顿军会确保一条通往磐石海岸的安全通道
The Boltons will give you safe passage to the Stony Shore.

他希望我们投降?

我的亲生父亲 你们的国王 很多年前曾向劳勃・拜拉席恩投降

我看着他屈膝下跪

没有丝毫耻辱
There was no shame there.

他战斗得光荣 和你们一样
He fought with honor, as did you.

抱歉 我没听清
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

只有夹着尾巴的狗才会这么说

你是女人么 小鬼? 
Are you a woman, boy?

铁种绝不投降
The ironborn will not surrender.

臭佬 我叫臭佬…
Reek. My name is Reek...

你去告诉你的主人
You go tell your master that,

席恩・葛雷乔伊 或者无论他妈的什么人
Theon Greyjoy, or whoever the fuck you are.

你他妈的到底在嘀咕些什么? 
What in the hell are you muttering?

如果我们投降 就能活命? 
If we yield, we live?

这张纸上是这么说的么? 
Is that what it says on this paper here?

是的 让你的人挂上白旗打开大门
Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates.

你不会真以为我会放他们回去吧? 
You didn't really think I'd let them go, did you?

剥皮已经不再流行了
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

传统非常重要
Traditions are important.

没有历史我们算什么? 
Where are we without our history?

你有外族人的血统 是么 贝里席? 
You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?

是的 我的曾祖父来自布拉佛斯
A greatgrandfather from Braavos, yes.

培提尔・贝里席
'小指头' 赫伦堡公爵  峡谷守护者

我想我们的祖先 原本都来自其他一些地方
I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.

我们的祖先早在数千年前 就在谷地定居
Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago.

之后我们击退了无数的入侵者
We've fought off invaders ever since.

谷地的美丽 只有这里伟大的贵族家族能与之相配
The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families.

艾林夫人常常对我提起 你就是她的坚石 罗伊斯大人
Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.

她从未跟我提起过你 贝里席
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.

但也用不着她跟我说
But I didn't need to hear from her.

放债人 皮条客
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

你给泰温・兰尼斯特舔鞋子舔了这么久 舌头还没舔黑可真是个奇迹  大人
You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black. My lord

当琼恩・艾林任命你做财政大臣时 没人在乎
And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared.

反正是一份肮脏的工作
Always been a grubby job.

约恩・罗伊斯
'青铜约恩' 谷地领主

为何不让一个肮脏的人做呢? 
Why not let a grubby man do it?

但当我听说你躲在这里 巴结讨好艾林女士
But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn

艾林女士邀请我来这里
Lady Arryn invited me.

我们从小就非常亲密
She and I have been close since childhood.

是啊 我们都知道你们有多亲密
Yes, we all know how close you were.

艾林女士的偏好是她自己的事
Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair.

可我们不能坐视她的死亡
Her death is our affair.

当然 她的自杀让我们都非常震惊
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

每个人都知道 但自杀? 
Everyone knew that. But suicide?

她深深爱着她的孩子
She adored that boy of hers.

我不认为她会抛弃他 不会是自愿的
I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.

奇怪的是你刚到这里没几天 艾林女士就和你成婚 然后就掉下了月门
Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

她总是容易陷入忧郁
She was always prone to melancholy.

艾林女士并不像我们一样适应这个残酷的世界
My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.

我们听说当时还有人在场 一个女孩
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

我想是你的一个侄女
A niece of yours, I believe.

一个啥都不懂的蠢姑娘
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

我向你们保证 她帮不上什么忙
I assure you, she would be of no help.

我们想跟她谈谈
We'd like to speak with her.

我去带她过来  不用了
Let me fetch her.   No need.

我们想听听她没受人影响的证词
We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.

你无须害怕我们 也不用怕他
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

这位贝里席大人是你的叔叔? 
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

也许让贝里席大人离开 你会更自在一些
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.

女士   我没在问你
My lady  I wasn't asking you.

他可以留下 大声点 女孩 你可不是一只该死的小老鼠
He can stay.  Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

告诉我们你看到了什么
Tell us what you saw.

对不起 贝里席大人
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

我必须说出事实
I have to tell the truth.

我会把一切都告诉你们
I'll tell you everything.

请说吧 阿莲 什么也不要隐瞒
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

我的名字并不是阿莲
My name is not Alayne.

而是珊莎・史塔克 艾德・史塔克公爵的长女
It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

罗伊斯大人 您拜访临冬城时我们曾见过面
Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell.

您当时正送您的儿子威玛爵士前往长城
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.

你竟然当着我面撒谎 你这卑鄙小人? 
You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?

贝里席大人说过很多谎话
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

自从我的父亲被处决后
Since my father was executed,

我就成了君临城里的人质
I have been a hostage in King's Landing.

一个让乔佛里蹂躏 让瑟曦太后折磨的玩物
A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment.

他们打我 羞辱我 他们把我嫁给小恶魔
They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp.

在君临城我没有朋友… 除了他
I had no friends in King's Landing...  except one.

寻找时机把我偷偷带了出来
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

他知道我在鹰巢城 和我的血亲莱莎姨妈在一起会很安全
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

但兰尼斯特在哪里都有朋友
The Lannisters have friends everywhere.

他让我发誓不跟任何人说我的真实身份
He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.

你的秘密在这里很安全 小姐
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

你的父亲就在这些厅堂里长大
Your father grew up right here in these halls.

我们经常一起打猎
We hunted together many times.

告诉我们你的姨妈发生了什么事 珊莎
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

你们很了解她 大人 夫人
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

你们知道她有些问题
You knew she was a troubled woman.

她一直爱着贝里席大人
She always loved Lord Baelish.

从他到奔流城的那一刻起 一个八岁的男孩 一个小麻袋装着他所有的财物
From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack.

她向我坦诚自己从未爱过艾林大人
She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn.

她只不过是听从父亲的命令 就像我们许多人一样
She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have.

现在诸神终于让她和贝里席大人结合 她非常高兴
When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy.

我的姨妈是个善妒的女人
My aunt was a jealous lady.

她担心贝里席大人 会不再爱她
She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore.

会为了别的年轻女人抛弃她
That he would abandon her for a younger woman.

后来… 有一天她看到他亲了我
And then...  one day she saw him kiss me.

只是脸颊上的轻轻一吻 罗伊斯大人 仅此而已
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more.

通过联姻 现在我真的成了贝里席大人的侄女
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage.

他一直都对我很好
He's always been so kind to me.

我很高兴能呆在这里 能重获自由
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

可姨妈却把矛头指向我
But my aunt turned on me.

她诅咒我 管我叫荡妇
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

还发誓要把我丢下月门
Promised to throw me through the Moon Door.

而当贝里席大人试着让她冷静下来时 她打了他
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him.

她说她再也不想活了
She said she didn't want to live anymore.

她就站在月门边上
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.

他想方设法去说服她
He tried to reason with her.

向她保证她是自己唯一爱过的人 但她还是踏了出去 她
Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was

嘘 这不是你的错 乖女孩
Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl.

从她养育那男孩的方式就能看出来
You could see it in the way she raised that boy.

都十岁了还要亲自用奶子为他哺乳
Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.

罗伊斯大人! 现在不是说这个的时候
Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

还有你 贝里席
And to you as well, Baelish.

我们对你有些苛刻
We treated you a bit harshly.

这没什么好抱怨的
You want justice, Lord Royce.

你寻求正义 罗伊斯大人
I can hardly complain about that.

自杀这种事可没什么正义可伸张 不是么? 
Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?

对莱莎而言 没有 但对她的儿子呢? 
For Lysa, no. But for her son?

仅仅二十年前 谷地的骑士 跟随着琼恩・艾林 奈德・史塔克和劳勃・拜拉席恩
Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

并肩战斗 击败了疯王
They fought together to overcome the Mad King.

而在那之后 艾林和罗伊斯
And since then, Arryn and Royce,

科布瑞 韦伍德 所有这些谷地的大家族都作壁上观
Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner.

就像胆小男孩一样看着这场混乱争斗
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

你在质疑我们的勇气么? 
Are you questioning our courage?

我想知道你们站在哪一边
I want to know which side you're on.

难道你们支持兰尼斯特?  这个家族可是处决了你们的好友奈德・史塔克啊
Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?

我们当然不会支持该死的兰尼斯特
Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.

不会么? 凯特琳・史塔克向她的妹妹乞求支援 却被莱莎拒绝了
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused.

通过置身于这场争斗之外 你们让泰温・兰尼斯特 彻底的消灭了他的每一个对手
By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point.

现在还有谁反抗他? 
Who stands against him now?

你想我们支持谁 贝里席大人? 
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?

我想你们支持罗宾・艾林
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

罗宾・艾林是个病弱的小男孩
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

而病弱的小男孩也可以成长为强大的男人
And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.

更常见的是夭折早逝
More often they die young.

我全身心的爱慕着莱莎
I adored Lysa with all my heart.

但她太爱她的儿子了 简直就是溺爱
But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective.

他得学习如何使剑
He needs to learn how to swing a sword.

是啊 该学了   的确如此
Aye, it's time.  Yes, it's time.

是时候安排他巡游谷地 拜访他治下的所有城堡了
Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain.

是时候让小鸟儿罗宾离巢喽
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
'无畏的' 女王铁卫

巴利斯坦爵士  乔拉爵士
Ser Barristan. Ser Jorah.

我错过御前会议了? 
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

皇家赦免令 由劳勃・拜拉席恩签署
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

我想先光明正大地告知你 而非暗中告密
I wanted to tell you first, mantoman rather than go behind your back.

让我单独跟她解释吧
Let me speak with her in private.

从今往后你不得再与她独处
You'll never be alone with her again.

篡夺者为何赦免你? 
Why did the usurper pardon you?

可容我私下解释
If we could speak alone.

不行 有话就在这讲
No, speak to me here.

您认为是谁送此物到弥林的? 
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?

这是泰温・兰尼斯特的伎俩啊
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.

他想离间我们
He wants to divide us.

一旦窝里斗起来 我们就无暇对抗他了
If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.

赦免令是在你我相遇那年签署的
The pardon was signed the year we met.

你到底因何被赦免? 
Why were you pardoned?

难不成你想说文件是伪造的
Unless you're saying this document was forged.

我曾为瓦里斯通风报信 他是君临的情报总管
I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.

你都对他通报了些什么? 
What was the content of these letters?

一些消息  什么消息? 
Information.  What information?

您和韦赛里斯抵达潘托斯之事
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

他计划将您下嫁给卓戈卡奥
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.

您的大婚之日
When you were married.

还有您哥哥的死讯
When your brother died.

是你告诉他我怀上了卓戈卡奥的孩子? 
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

卡丽熙  不准这么叫我
Khaleesi. Don't call me that.

你是否告诉他我怀上了卓戈卡奥的孩子? 
Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?

那个酒商想要毒杀我 就因为你的消息
That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.

我阻止了您饮下毒酒
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

那是因为你知道酒里有毒
Because you knew it was poisoned.

你从一开始 就背叛了我
You betrayed me from the first.

我从未想过 求求您 卡丽熙 宽恕我
I never meant please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

你将我的秘密卖给了杀害我父亲 并篡夺我哥哥王位的家伙   我也曾救过您
You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...  I have protected you.

我也曾为您战斗搏杀
Fought for you. Killed for you.

... 而你现在倒想要我的宽恕? 
...and you want me to forgive you?

爱? 你竟敢提这个字? 
Love? How can you say that to me?

换成其他人 我早将他处决了
Any other man, and I would have you executed.

而你 不管是活人还是尸体 我都不愿让你驻留在我的城市
But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

回你在君临的主子身边去
Go back to your masters in King's Landing.

有种去要你的赦免啊
Collect your pardon if you can.

休想再碰我一下 休想再直呼我名
Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name.

限你今日黄昏前打点好行李 时间一到就给我出城
You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city.

次日若你还在弥林逗留
If you're found in Meereen past break of day,

我将命人把你的头颅丢进奴隶湾
I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay.

卡林湾是您的了 父亲
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

洛克那有什么消息没? 
Has there been any word from Locke?

一个是残废 一个是小屁孩
A cripple, a young boy.

近来也没有哪个北境诸侯见过他俩
None of the northern lords have seen them.

大部分铁民已经逃窜出北境
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.

而且还会越来越多, 这都是你的功劳
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

说说你看到了什么
Tell me what you see.

沼泽 平原 丘陵
Moors, fields, hills.

说说你到底看到了什么
Tell me what you see.

朝那个方向骑行 700 里 仍身处北境
Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North.

北境的面积比其他六大王国加一起还要大
The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined.

而我身为北境守护
And I am the Warden of the North.

告诉我 你叫什么名字? 
Now tell me, what is your name?

从今天起直至你逝世之日 你的姓名都是拉姆斯・波顿 北境守护卢斯・波顿的嫡子
From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

我发誓将继承发扬您的家族姓氏 和传统
I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition.

我不会辜负您的厚望 父亲
I will be worthy of you, Father,

快点 臭佬 我得洗个澡喽
Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

我初见你时 你还是个孩子
First time I saw you, you were just a child.

一个初到君临的北境少女
A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time.

如今稚气已荡然无存
Not a child any longer.

要是被他们判为有罪的话 您就会被扔出月门
They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

这不是我要的答案
That's not an answer.

要是您被处决了 我的下场又会如何呢? 
If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?

与其把赌注下在陌生人身上 还不如下在熟人身上更可靠对吧? 
Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't?

而你觉得自己跟我很熟了? 
And you think you know me?

我知道您想要什么
I know what you want.

我还以为自己会很开心呢 但并没有 没那个心情
I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really.

这世上没什么可开心的
Nothing makes you happy.

我感觉挺多的   比如? 
Lots of things make me happy.  Like what?

杀掉波利佛 杀掉罗尔杰什么的
Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

所以说没法亲手杀掉乔佛里你就不开心了
So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself.

哪怕能让我亲眼看看也好啊
At least I could have been there to watch.

真想看看他意识到自己死到临头时的眼神
I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.

没错 那眼神肯定是世上最棒的
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

你大半辈子都在护卫他
You protected him for most of his life.

你觉得自己能救下他吗? 
You think you could have saved him?

我他妈又不是试毒的
I wasn't the damn wine taster.

小杂种确实该死 但是用毒的话 下毒是娘儿们的招数
Little shit deserved to die, but poison poison's a woman's weapon.

你们这么说不过是死要面子罢了
That's your stupid pride talking.

所以你才成不了一个优秀杀手
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

要是没别的武器 我拿鸡骨头也能干掉乔佛里
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.

要真能看到这一幕我愿意花大钱
I'd pay good money to see that.

你真该让我帮你把伤口烙一下
You should have let me burn it.

这跳蚤可让你的脚力大大下降了
That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.

反正也不用走多远了
Well, we won't have to walk too much further.

你真以为我姨妈会花钱赎我? 
You really think my aunt will pay for me?

我连她面都没见过
I've never even met her.

无所谓 你是她亲戚
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

她的族语不是家族 荣誉之类的玩意儿吗
Family, honor, all that horseshit.

你们这些贵族老爷淑女整天挂嘴边
It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.

欲过血门者何人? 
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

老子是猎狗 桑铎・克里岗
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

这位是...  随行者乃是艾莉亚・史塔克 你们莱莎・艾林夫人的侄女
And his...  traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.

请您节哀顺变
Then I offer my condolences.

我从没离开过家呀 培提尔叔叔
I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr.

我好害怕   您不必害怕
I'm afraid to leave. You shouldn't be.

母亲说过身为谷地公爵就该乖乖地待在鹰巢城里
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.

外头不安全
She said it's not safe outside.

她待在这儿也不见得安全
It wasn't safe for her inside.

罗宾・艾林
鹰巢城公爵

睡个觉也能死
They die in their beds.

哪怕蹲个夜壶也能蹲死咯
They die squatting over their chamber pots.

早晚都有一死
Everybody dies sooner or later.

别操心自个儿的死法啦
Don't worry about your death.

操心该怎么活吧
Worry about your life.

只要活上一天 就要自己做主
Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.

这才是身为谷地公爵该操心的
That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者'  御林铁卫队长

要诸神慧眼识真 裁决一个人是有罪或无辜 却得搭上两个人往死里对砍
Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces.

诸神就这德行
Tells you something about the gods.

你觉得奥柏伦能赢? 
Do you think Oberyn has a chance?

多恩的红毒蛇
The Red Viper of Dorne.

你要不致命上哪弄这么个头衔去 是吧? 
You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?

我从没看他打过
I've never seen him fight.

噢  他要死了 我也得玩完
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

奥柏伦很有自信
Oberyn believes in himself.

说'玩完'都算委婉了
That's putting it mildly.

弑君之罪该怎么判来着? 
What's the punishment for regicide?

五马分尸? 绞死? 
Drawing and quartering? Hanging?

车轮刑? 砍头
Breaking at the wheel? Beheading.

会不会太普通了点
Seems rather ordinary.

他还是我亲外甥 这又该怎么算? 
And he was my nephew as well, so what is that?

兄弟相残叫'弑兄'
Fratricide is brothers.

'弑甥' 这词儿不错
Nepoticide. That's the one.

还有弑母 弑父 杀婴 自杀
Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide.

每种杀人行为都有专门的名词来概括啊
There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.

表亲相杀 没错
Cousins, you're right.

没有专门形容表亲相杀的词儿
There is no word for cousin killing.

你还记得咱堂兄奥森吗? 奥森・兰尼斯特? 
Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?

当然了 奶妈把他掉地上摔坏了头
Of course. Wetnurse dropped him on his head.

让他变呆了  呆? 
Left him simple. Simple?

他从前在花园里一坐就是一天
Used to sit all day in the garden.

拿个石头砸甲虫
Crushing beetles with a rock.

完全不知道什么快乐
Nothing made him happier.

你也不知道什么是快乐
Nothing made you happier.

因为天生的缺陷 让你觉得自己跟那些可怜人更亲近些
You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.

正相反 只有在嘲笑那些可怜人的时候 我才觉得自己跟其他人是平等的
On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.

傻子看久了就不觉得好笑了
The joke wore thin, though.

那是你 你不看就不看呗
For you. You drifted away.

我有别的爱好
I had other interests.

是啊 别的爱好
Yes, other interests.

我倒是一直陪着奥森
But I stayed with Orson.

他为什么要砸那些甲虫? 
Why was he smashing all those beetles?

他从中得到了什么? 
What did he get out of it?

一开始我跑去问他
First thing I did was ask him.

他回答道 '砸甲壳虫'
He gave me an answer. 'Smash the beetles.

在我认识的所有人中 我就是最聪明的那个
I was the smartest person I knew.

我完全有那个能力去揭开一个 藏于弱智心中的秘密
Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron.

于是我去了瓦拉瑞克学士的书房
So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

那个瓦拉瑞克 他有次想对我动手动脚
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

结果我发现 有关大人物的著作实在太多 而有关弱智的书却少之又少
Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons.

总之 我一无所获 找不到只言片语来解释奥森的鬼德行 也搞不清他为什么会坚持不懈地残害那些甲虫
In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter.

所以我又回到原点
So I went back to the source.

也许我无法与奥森交谈 但我可以看着他 观察他 就像人们通过观察动物 从而进一步理解它们的行为那样
I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior.

就越确定一点
I became more and more sure of it.

这其中必有奥秘
There was something happening there.

他的脸就像书页一样 写满了我不懂的语言
His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand.

但他并不是无意识的 他有自己的动机
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

我着了魔一样想搞清他的动机
And I became possessed with knowing what they were.

我开始花大把大把的时间来观察他
I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him.

我把午饭都端在花园里吃 一边咀嚼羊肉一边听着...
I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of...

不观察他的时候 我就琢磨他
And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him.

父亲沉迷于家业 而我满脑子都是奥森的甲虫
Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles.

在我读坦格利安征服史的时候
I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.

我听到龙翼的拍打了吗? 没有
Did I hear dragon wings? No.

可我还是搞不明白他为什么要那么做
And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it.

我必须要弄明白 因为这太可怕了 那些甲虫就那么莫名其妙地被弄死了
And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.

这世上 每一天 都有成百上千的男人 女人和孩子被杀害
Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score.

谁他妈会在乎几只脏兮兮的甲虫啊? 
Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?

道理我不是不明白 但我就是害怕得很
I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread.

一堆又一堆 一年又一年
Piles and piles of them, years and years of them.

究竟有多少活生生的 到处乱爬的小东西 被活活砸死 血肉干枯 化为尘土? 
How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt?

我曾经梦见自己 站在一堆虫甲上 虫甲绵延开去 一望无际
In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see.

我大哭着醒来 为它们那支离破碎的小小尸体流泪
I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies.

我曾试图阻止奥森
I tried to stop Orson once.

他有你两个那么大
He was twice your size.

他'吭'一声就把我推到一边去 然后接着砸
He just pushed me aside with a 'kuuh' and kept on smashing.

他砸了一天又一天 直到那头骡子一蹄正中心口 将他踢死为止
Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.

那么 你怎么想? 
So what do you think?

这一切有什么意义? 
What was it all about?

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛' 情报总管

这护甲看起来好单薄
Looks like very light armor.

我喜欢灵活移动
I like to move around.

至少也该戴上顶头盔吧
You could at least wear a helmet.

战斗之前你不该喝酒的
You shouldn't drink before a fight.

奥柏伦・马泰尔
'红毒蛇' 多恩亲王

这是你玩竞技场的那几年学来的吗? 
You learn this during your years in the fighting pits?

开打前我从来都要喝点
I always drink before a fight.

那会让你送命的 也会让我送命
It could get you killed. It could get me killed.

今天不是我的死期
Today is not the day I die.

你要跟那东西打? 
You're going to fight that?

我要宰了那东西
I'm going to kill that.

他是我见过个头最大的家伙
He is the biggest man I've ever seen.

被放倒以后 个头就不重要了
Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.

在诸神和世人的注视下 我们聚首于此 以甄别这位提利昂・兰尼斯特 究竟有罪抑或无辜
In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...  man Tyrion Lannister.

愿圣母赐予他们慈悲
May the Mother grant them mercy.

愿天父赐予他们应得的判决
May the Father give them such justice as they deserve.

愿战士指引...
And may the Warrior guide the hand...

别留我在世上孤身一人
Don't leave me alone in this world.

他们告诉你我是谁了吗? 
Have they told you who I am?

我是伊莉亚・马泰尔的弟弟
I am the brother of Elia Martell.

知道我为什么千里迢迢赶来这座 屎堆一样臭的城市吗? 
Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shitpile of a city?

我要在你死前听你认罪
I'm going to hear you confess before you die.

你害了她孩子
You killed her children.

说出来 我让你死个痛快
Say it now and we can make this quick.

说出来 你奸了她
Say it. You raped her.

你害了她孩子
You killed her children.

你害了她孩子!
You killed her children!

你害了她孩子!
You killed her children!

你不能死 你还没认罪呢
You can't die yet. You haven't confessed.

说出她的名字 伊莉亚・马泰尔
Say her name. Elia Martell.

你奸了她 你害了她孩子
You raped her. You killed her children.

谁给你下的命令? 
Who gave you the order?

谁给你下的命令? !
Who gave you the order?!

你奸了她! 你杀了她!
You raped her! You murdered her!

你害了她孩子!
You killed her children.

说出来 说出她的名字
Say it. Say her name.

我杀了她的孩子
I killed her children.

然后我像这样捣碎了她的脑袋!
Then I smashed her head in like this!

诸神已宣告其意愿
The gods have made their will known.

提利昂・兰尼斯特 以拜拉席恩家族的国王
Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon,

托曼一世之名 我在此判处你死刑
First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.

她 有一头红发
She...  she had red hair.

- 她脚多大  - 你想说什么
- How big were her feet? - What do you want me to say?

我想让你告诉我  拥有另一半是什么感觉
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone.

你爱着她  她也爱着你
To love someone and have them love you back.

我们死期将至  比我预想早太多
We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned.

我想明白那感觉也只好问你了
You're the closest I'll ever get to knowing.

你跟吉莉没试过
So you and Gilly never?

她也没主动提过
And she never offered.

如果她主动了 你会吗
But if she had, you would have?

你会打破誓言吗
You'd have broken your vows?

有趣的是 我们的誓言也没明确禁止 与女人发生亲密关系
The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.

'我将不娶妻'  没错 誓言里说了  不可否认
'I shall take no wife,' Yes, that's in there. There's no denying that.

'不生子'  也很明确
'I shall father no children.' It's very specific.

但我们的誓言对其它行为是否有所约束 就见仁见智了
But what do our vows have to say about other...  activities is open to interpretation.

我看艾里沙爵士可不管什么见仁见智
I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.

反正他也没得见
Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret.

就是...  就是有个人  完完全全的另一个人
It's...  there's this person, this whole other person.

你满心满眼都是她  她满心满眼都是你
And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you.

然后你 有那么一...  一瞬间  你不仅仅是你自己
And you-- for a little-- for a little while, you're more than just you.

你就... 我说不清  我他妈又不是诗人
You're-- I don't know. I'm not a bleeding poet.

嗯  你真不是
No, you're really not.

瞧我得到了什么
What did I get for it?

差六吋一箭穿心
An arrow six inches from my heart.

我猜我们挨个当箭靶的日子也不远了
There'll be arrows for all of us soon, I imagine.

他们已经让我遭遇了最可怕的事情
They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.

去睡一会儿吧  山姆
Go get some sleep, Sam.

这一班我来守
I'll take this watch.

我有没有给你们讲过她
Did I ever tell you about her?

那可是难忘的一夜
That was a night to remember.

当然我是喝得有点儿多
Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink.

她的獠牙很锋利 可她晓得怎么用
Her fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them.

她下面又甜又软
And she was nice and soft down below.

不  她可不是普通的野兽
No, she was no ordinary beast.

多少男人...
Many is the man who--

我知道你没操过熊
I know you never fucked a bear.

你也知道自己没操过熊
You know you never fucked a bear.

我现下不想琢磨你没操过的那头熊
Right now I don't want to think about the bear you never fucked.

我现下只想琢磨 这里的每一支箭  都要穿过一只乌鸦的心
Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow's heart.

我们可能还要等些时候呢
We could be waiting here a while.

我们等得越久  我的箭就越多
The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have.

他们来到我们的土地上 建起高墙  说这是他们的地盘
They came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs.

然后把我们赶尽杀绝
Then they started hunting us down.

这次换成我们来杀他们
This time, we're the ones doing the hunting.

打打杀杀的事  你的话还真多
You've got a lot to say about killing.

话比箭还多
Even more words than arrows.

在那些村子里头  我杀的人可不比你少
Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did.

是啊  可里面没有你那乌鸦情人
Yes, but none of those were your crow lover.

他可能已经死在我手里了
I probably killed him already.

就算没死 他唯一的遗骸 也只会是挂在我脖子上的小玩意儿
And if not, the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around my neck.

知道我觉得你再见他会怎样吗
Know what I think you do when you see him?

用你那红毛小穴好好招待他
Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.

你惦记那红毛小穴了吗
You been thinking about that ginger minge?

想知道是什么滋味
Wondering what it tasts like.

谁胆敢杀他
Anyone else tries to kill him,

我就送支箭给谁
I'll have an arrow for them.

你那些光头朋友太慢  拦不住我
And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.

什么要紧事不能等到明早呢  塔利
And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?

- 您怎么知道...  - 知道是你吗
- How did you know-- - That it was you?

除了山姆威尔·塔利 还有谁会浪费蜡烛 大半夜跑来读书呢
Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?

- 我来帮您  - 噢  用不着
- Let me help you. - Oh, no need.

整个黑城堡我最熟悉的 就数这间图书室了
I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black.

数千书册 却没有眼睛读
Thousands of books and no eyes to read them.

人到暮年  旁的好处没有 生活的讽刺倒是俯首可拾
Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else.

你还没回答我的问题
But you didn't answer my question.

你在读什么
What are you reading?

我可以担保  福尔学士终其一生 与野人的接触仅限于书卷
I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a wildling was this very library.

但书中所述的野人行径 全是事实
But what he says about what they do, it's all true.

是遭遇野人的幸存者的实录
It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.

是啊  想象一下野人会怎么讲我们
Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.

情爱是责任的大忌
Love is the death of duty.

我对你的朋友琼恩·雪诺说过一次
I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.

他没听  你也一样
He didn't listen and neither did you.

所以你没在长城上头守夜 却跑来读这些可怕的故事 忧心它们或许已经发生在你爱的姑娘身上
Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love.

你第一次带她来见我  我就听出来了
Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me.

我还记得情有所衷的语调
I remember how it sounds.

你可以想象那可怜的姑娘 和她的孩子遭遇各种各样的坏事
You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child.

想象一个糟老头子也曾和你一样 青春年少  有那么难吗
Is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?

我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it like that.

你知道我来这里之前的身份吗
Do you know who I was before I came here?

只要我说出那个字  我会成为什么人吗
What I could have been if I'd only said the word?

我还是伊蒙·坦格利安时  见过许多姑娘
I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen.

王位继承人总是这样
A future king always does.

其中一些特别主动 想要博得我的青睐
Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections.

有一个成功了
One of them succeeded.

我可以给你讲她的一切
I could tell you everything about her.

她是谁 我们如何初见 她眼睛的颜色 她鼻子的形状
Who she was, how we met, the color of her eyes, and the shape of her nose.

我可以看到她 就在我面前
I can see her right in front of me.

比你更真实
She's more real than you are.

我们可以讲一整晚那些年逝去的爱情
We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves.

死亡迫在眉睫 更显得回忆如此甜蜜
Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death.

对不起  任何人不得进门  这是命令
Sorry, I can't open the gate for anybody. Orders.

你不明白  他们杀死了所有人
You don't understand. They killed everyone.

只剩下我和孩子
Everyone but me and my baby.

他们就在外面  我来的路上看见他们了
They're out there. I saw them on my way here.

他们可能看见我了  可能跟着我  求你了
They may have seen me. They may have followed me. Please.

要是他们在外面发现我  你不知道...
If they find us out here, you don't know...

- 不行  - 山姆  是你吗
- I can't. - Sam, is that you?

索恩严令不得开门
Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.

派普  你他妈的给我开门
Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!

我从没听过你说脏话
I never heard you curse before.

是的  你最好习惯一下
Yes, well, best get used to it.

你没事了
Shh, you're all right.

你当然没事了  勇敢的小伙子
Of course you are, my brave little fella.

- 太可怕了  - 对不起
- It was horrible. - I'm so, so sorry.

我回来后才知道的
I didn't know until I got back.

别让他们赶我走了  山姆
Don't let them send me away, Sam.

- 永远不会  - 我知道这里不留女人
- Never. - I know there's no women allowed.

谁敢赶你走  先要过我这一关
Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me.

从现在开始  你去哪里
From now on, wherever you go,

- 守住门  - 备战
- Man the gate! - Ready yourselves!

- 备战  - 上长城
- Prepare! - Up on the Wall!

那边有多少人
How many? How many are there?

点火  全点上
Light them up! Light them all!

好了  伙计们  第一桶
Here we go, boys, there's one.

来吧  第二桶
Let's go. There's two.

我们去搬下一批
Let's get the next load.

这是最后一桶油了  艾里沙爵士
That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.

你想说就说吧
You can say it if you like.

我们早该封锁隧道 听你的建议
We should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance, like you suggested.

那是个两难的决定  爵士
It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.

你知道管事意味着什么吗  雪诺大人
Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow?

意味着每个长了嘴的聪明鬼 都可以质疑管事的人
It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth.

但如果他也质疑自己 那就完了 他完了  聪明鬼完了 所有人都完了
But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end-- for him, for the clever little twats, for everyone.

这次不算完  完蛋的不是我们
This is not the end. Not for us.

只要你们尽忠职守 坚持到击退他们就行
Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back.

然后你可以接着恨我 我也可以接着讨厌你 怪你的野人婊子当初没干掉你
And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your wildling whore had finished the job.

你在这里很安全
You'll be safe down here.

我会尽快来看你
I'll check on you as soon as I can.

你又要离开我
You're leaving me again?

你要去上面 我们留在下面  这就是离开
You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving.

你说过从今往后我们不分开
You said from now on we'd stay together.

我不是说在同一间屋子里
I didn't mean in the same room.

你要去外面做什么
What are you going to do out there?

- 帮我的兄弟们  - 怎么帮
- Help my brothers. - How?

你要和那些自由民打仗吗
You're going to fight the free folk when they come?

他们会杀了你  他们杀了鼹鼠村的所有人
They'll kill you. In Mole's Town, they killed everyone.

我不能和你躲在这里  让他们在外面打仗
I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.

为什么不行  上面又不需要你
Why not? You won't matter up there.

我是守夜人的汉子  吉莉
I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly.

我发誓保卫长城 我必须遵守誓言 男子汉就该这样
I made a promise to defend the Wall and I have to keep it because that's what men do.

向我保证你不会死
Promise me you won't die.

我保证我不会死
I promise you I won't die.

长城那边的野人比这边要多得多
There's a lot more wildlings on the other side of the Wall than this side.

我们有很多武器和装备
We've got loads of weapons and things.

这里对我们来说再好不过了
It's the perfect place for us to be.

我从没掷过长矛
I've never thrown a spear before.

我从没握过开刃的剑
I've never held a sword with a proper edge.

这地方真不是我该来的
This is no place for me to be.

我当然怕了
Of course I'm afraid.

有一帮野人要来杀我们
There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us.

你要是连一帮野人都怕 那你之前到底是怎么干掉异鬼的
If you're afraid of a band of wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker?

我那时候不知道自己能杀死它
I didn't know I was going to kill it.

但我总得做点什么
But I had to do something.

我别无选择
I didn't have any choice.

不然它就会杀死吉莉  掳走孩子
It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby.

如果那时候有人问我的名字
If someone had asked me my name right then,

我肯定答不上来
I wouldn't have known.

我不再是山姆威尔·塔利
I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore.

也不是守夜人的事务官 或者蓝道·塔利之子  或者别的什么身份
I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that.

我什么都不是
I was nothing at all.

而你什么都不是的时候 就没什么好怕的了
And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.

但你现在又害怕了
But you're afraid now?

我现在又有身份了
I'm not nothing anymore.

他们大多上了长城
Most of their men are up top.

下面只剩不到二十人
Didn't count more than 20 down here. Leftovers.

前门由一个大胖子和一个小瘦子看守
They got a big fat one and a little bony one manning the front.

城墙有多高
How high are the walls?

估计等我们翻过去了  他们才会察觉
Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.

杀乌鸦去
Let's kill some crows!

我说上弦  待命  你们这些蠢货
I said nock and hold, you cunts!

- 上弦是要你们拉弓吗  - 不是  爵士
- Does nock mean draw? - No, Ser!

- 待命是要你们扔桶吗  - 不是  爵士
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? - No, Ser!

- 你们打算今晚死在这儿吗  - 不  爵士
- You all plan to die here tonight? - No, Ser!

答得好  拉弓
That's very good to hear. Draw!

他们在攻打南门
They're attacking the southern gate!

我下去看看  史林特兄弟  长城是你的了
I'm going down there. Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.

你们还傻站着干什么  给我放箭
What are you fucking waiting for? Loose!

你们听到了  放
You heard the man. Loose!

- 射中了吗  - 没有
- Did you get one? - No.

我们可能要死了
I think we're gonna die.

如果你老是射偏  我们当然会死
If you keep missing, we will.

上百代守夜人保卫过这座城堡
100 generations have defended this castle.

从未失陷
She's never fallen before.

今夜也不会失守
She will not fall tonight.

爬上城墙的是瑟恩人
Those are Thenns at our walls.

他们会吃掉自己的手下败将
They eat the flesh of the men they kill.

你们想当瑟恩人的晚餐吗
Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight?

等到旭日东升  我向你们保证
And when the sun rises, I promise you,

黑城堡将屹立不倒
Castle Black will stand!

守夜人将万世长存
The Night's Watch will stand.

剑在手  跟我走
With me now! Now with me!

没有军纪  也没有经过训练
No discipline. No training.

不过是帮乌合之众
Gang of thieves, that's all this is.

我指挥过君临的都城守备队
I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing.

他们会绝对服从命令
Those men obeyed orders.

我们不能眼睁睁看着他们攻打城门
We can't just let them attack the gate.

城门上的铁栅粗达四吋  全是精钢打造
The bars of those gates are four inches of cold-rolled steel.

城下可是骑着长毛象的巨人
Those are giants riding mammoths down there!

你觉得光靠精钢铁栅就能挡住他们吗
Do you think your cold-rolled steel is gonna stop them?

哪儿有什么巨人
No such thing as giants.

那都是骗小孩的故事
A story for the children.

我们刚得到消息  艾里沙爵士需要您去支援
We just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below.

您现在是最有经验的人  爵士  他需要您
You're the most experienced man he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

弓手  上弦
Archers, nock your arrows!

他们黎明前登不上顶
They won't summit before dawn.

你怎么知道
How do you know that?

因为我登过
Because I've made that climb.

我想他们要比你那会儿心急得多
I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.

快扔石头
Come on with the rocks!

去城门  快点动起来
To the gate. Come on, let's move.

我射死一个  一箭穿心
I got one right through the heart. He's dead.

- 杀光了吗  - 没有
- Oh, is it over? - No.

没事的  你不会有事
You're all right. You're all right.

伊蒙学士马上就到
Maester Aemon is coming.

他会有办法的
He's gonna make it all right.

外门保不住了
The outer gate won't hold.

带上五个人  守住内门
Take five men, hold the inner gate.

如果他们进来了...
If they make it through...

跟我走  希山  还有你  库珀
Come on, Hill. And you, Cooper.

快点  你们这些懒鬼
Come on, you lazy bastards.

一定要给我守住门
Hold the fucking gate!

下面需要支援
We need more men down here.

- 我们必须守住门  - 但这里也需要人
- We have to hold the gate. - But we need men here.

跟琼恩说  他现在是头儿
Tell Jon. He's in command.

把我送上去  听见没有
Get me to the top! You hear me?!

你叫奥利  是吗
Your name's Olly, right?

听我说  奥利  把我送上去
Listen to me, Olly. Get me to the top.

等我们发出信号后  再把我们放下来
And when we give the signal, bring us back down.

找个武器跟他们战斗  奥利
Find a weapon, Olly. Fight them.

都让开  我们走
Clear the way! Let's go!

- 别挡道  - 都让开
- Out of the way! - Get out of here!

- 再多来几个弓箭手  - 我来
- We need more archers. - Here I am.

- 快点  - 快
- Come on. - Quickly.

你来做什么
What are you doing up here?

野人杀过城墙了
The wildlings are over the walls.

艾里沙爵士已经倒下
Ser Alliser's fallen.

城堡坚持不了多久
The castle won't stand much longer.

艾迪  长城是你的了
Edd, you have the Wall.

如果他们再使长毛象  就用火烧他们
If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them.

如果那些人爬得太高  就放巨镰
If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.

来  兄弟们  跟我一起战斗
Come, brothers. Now fight with me!

咱们享受最后一晚  是吧  伙计们
Might as well enjoy our last night, right, boys?

把他妈的箭都点上火
Light the fuckers up!

我们怎么挡住那家伙
How are we gonna stop that?

已经射他二十箭了
Shot 20 arrows in him already.

你听见琼恩的话了  我们要守住门
You heard Jon. We hold the gate.

琼恩·雪诺不是总司令
Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.

圣母  救我  天父  救我
Mother, save me. Father, save me.

这儿没有神
The gods aren't down here.

只有我们六个  听见没
It's the six of us. You hear me?

长夜将至  我从今开始守望
Night gathers and now my watch begins.

至死方休
It shall not end until my death.

我将不娶妻  不封地 不生子
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

我将不戴宝冠  不争荣宠
I shall wear no crown and win no glory.

我将尽忠职守  生死于斯
I shall live and die at my post.

我是黑暗中的利剑
I am the sword in the darkness.

长城上的守卫
I am the watcher on the walls.

守卫王国的坚盾
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人 今夜如此  夜夜皆然
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch for this night and all the nights to come!

我不希望你出去
I don't want you out there.

你不能永远保护我
You can't protect me forever.

一旦城堡沦陷  也无处可藏
There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.

比起你  我更需要它
I need him more than I need you.

还记得那个山洞吗
Do you remember the cave?

我们不该离开那山洞
We should have stayed in the cave.

你什么都不懂  琼恩·雪诺
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

放巨镰  兄弟们
Drop the scythe, boys!

- 拉起来  - 拉起来
- Hoist her up. - Hoist her up!

今晚够他们受的了
They've had enough for one night.

别欢呼太大声
Don't cheer too loud.

他们的人数依然是我们的一千倍
They still outnumber us 1,000 to one.

真汉子就该这样结束
This is how a man ends.

我们晚点再问他话
We'll question him later.

我应该把你 从长城顶上扔下去  臭小子
I should have thrown you from the top of the Wall, boy!

啊  是我  是我啊
Whoa, it's me. It's me.

我答应过你  不是吗
I promised you, didn't I?

这是伟大的胜利
This is a great victory.

曼斯在试探我们的防御  他差点就攻破了
Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through.

他还有更多的巨人  更多的长毛象
And he has more giants. He has more mammoths.

还有千倍于我们的人
He has 1,000 times as many men.

他们今晚还会进攻
They'll hit us again tonight.

也许我们能抵挡他们一两天 但绝无可能击败他们
Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we'll never beat them.

去找... 你不能去
To fi--- you can't do that.

没人给你下令
No one gave you any orders.

还有谁能下令
Who's left to give orders?

野人之所以组建成军  全因为曼斯
The wildling army's only an army because of Mance.

他联合了上百个战斗部落
He united 100 warring tribes.

没了曼斯  他们群龙无首
Without Mance, they lose their leader.

没了目标  就会彼此开战
They lose their purpose. They go back to fighting each other.

四散回家
Scatter back to their homes.

你要去杀死他吗
You're going to kill him?

你根本没法靠近他一百码之内
They'll never let you within 100 yards of him.

就算你过去了  就算你杀了他
And even if they did, even if you managed to kill him--

他们会杀我吗  我不去  他们也会杀死我
They'll kill me? If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

把我们剩下的人全杀了
They'll kill the rest of us, too.

他们不会直接杀死你
They won't just kill you.

他们会烹了你  活剐了你
They'll boil you. They'll flay you.

让你生不如死
They'll make it last days.

你说得对  这个计划真烂
You're right. It's a bad plan.

带几个兄弟下来帮你
Get some brothers down here to help you.

我们必须烧掉尸体
We need to burn the bodies.

升起外门
Raise the outer gate.

我一出去就立刻放下来
Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

我答应过莫尔蒙  不会再丢掉它
I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again.

万一我这次不能回来
In case I don't come back.

艾迪森·托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

你又披上了黑袍
You're wearing a black cloak again.

他们派我前来与你谈判
I've been sent to negotiate with you.

似乎我轻信的天性又一次占了上风
It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.

这也不是第一次了
It's happened before.

琼恩·雪诺 我多希望当时你向我们宣誓时是忠诚的
I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

断掌科林命我加入你的军队 然后把收集到的一切信息带回黑城堡
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.

他让我杀了他以便获得你们的信任
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

我的确忠于他… 我忠于科林与守夜人的誓言
I was loyal...  to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

她还不足以改变你 对吗? 
She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

那你足以改变她吗? 
Were you enough to turn her?

我离开时 她向我 射了三箭
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

你在黑城堡与她重逢了吗? 
Did you see her again at Castle Black?

我有千万种方法可以杀了你 还不至于要下毒
Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.

不 这是北境人喝的酒 琼恩·雪诺
No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

你们干的很好 战斗得很顽强
You did well. Fought hard.

有几个我们最强壮的战士也被你们杀了
Killed some of our strongest men.

我们的一位巨人进入了你们的地道 再也没出来
One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again.

他杀了我的朋友葛兰
He killed my friend Grenn.

他的血脉可以追溯到先民到达之前 他是硕果仅存的一位
The last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.

葛兰来自一个小农庄
Grenn came from a farm.

敬玛格与葛兰 敬葛兰与玛格
Mag and Grenn. Grenn and Mag.

科柏克 能拿点吃的来吗? 
Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?

我觉得我的客人可能有相当一段时间 没吃东西了吧
I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything for quite some time.

所以 你是来和我谈条件的? 
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

撤走军队 回家去吧
Turn your army around and go home.

你知道我很清楚你们的弓箭不多了 燃油不多了 人也不多了
You know I know you're low on arrows, you're low on oil, you're low on men.

你们还剩多少人? 有五十个吗? 
How many are left, 50?

我告诉托蒙德和欧瑞尔了
I told Tormund and Orell.

我们有一千多名战士
We have more than 1,000 men.

我把一切毫无保留的展示给你
I showed you everything I had.

我们十万人的大军
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

然而你做了什么? 你利用所知道的一切攻击我们
And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had.

可这并不算什么 我发现你背叛后
It wasn't much. As soon as I saw that,

立即调派了四百名勇士攀登城墙 从这儿向西五英里 有一段无人看守的区域
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall, an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

他们中许多人会死在攀登途中 然而今夜之后大部分勇士就将到达长城背后
A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day.

琼恩·雪诺 我对你十分诚实 你对我可从来不这么坦诚
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me.

我的人民已流得够多血了
My people have bled enough.

我们并不是来征服一切的
We're not here to conquer.

我们只希望躲到你们的长城后面
We're here to hide behind your Wall.

和你们一样 我们需要你们的地道
Just like you. We need your tunnel.

我们都知道凛冬将至
Now we both know that winter is coming.

如果我的人民不能在严冬到达之前迁入长城南面 我们的下场比死还不如
And if my people aren't south of the Wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead.

你希望和我们谈条件? 
You want to strike a bargain with me?

你回去 打开城门 我向你保证再不会有人死去
You go back, you open the gates to us, and I swear to you that no one else will die.

如果你拒绝 我们将屠尽黑城堡里所有的人
Refuse, and we'll kill every last man at Castle Black.

哦 这才是你的本意
Oh, that's why you're here.

我承认如果你动手的话他们来不及阻止你
I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.

当然 之后他们就会杀了你
They'd kill you, of course.

他们会慢慢虐杀你
They'd kill you slow.

不过你走进帐篷的时候就知道这一点了
But you knew that when you came in here.

你觉得你能下得了手吗 琼恩·雪诺? 
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

在帐篷主人主动议和时刺杀他? 
Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered you peace?

守夜人就这点能耐? 
Is that what the Night's Watch is?

你就这点能耐? 
Is that what you are?

你想趁和谈时突袭我们吗?  不
Are you attacking us? No.

正如你所说 我们没有兵力突袭
It's like you said, we don't have the men.

我说过我的人民已流够血了 这绝非虚言
I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.

戴佛斯·席渥斯
'洋葱骑士' 史坦尼斯的首相

别下马
Stay with the horses.

你就是塞外之王? 
You're the KingbeyondtheWall?

你知道我是谁吗?  未闻阁下大名
Do you know who I am? Never had the pleasure.

这是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩 七大王国唯一正统的国王
This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

我们并不在七大王国的疆界内 你的衣着可不适合这儿的天气
We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.

向国王投降时下跪是基本礼仪
It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

夜幕降临前我手下会有上千名你的子民 我们没有住宿安置他们 也没有食物喂养他们
I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.

我并不想屠杀无用的落水狗
I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.

他们的命运由他们的国王决定
Their fate depends on their king.

悉听尊便 我们绝不屈膝
All the same, we do not kneel.

一个守夜人跑到野人的帐篷里来干什么? 
What's a man of the Night's Watch doing in a wildling camp?

他们派我前来与塞外之王谈判
I was sent to discuss terms with the KingbeyondtheWall.

年轻人 你正与王国唯一的正统国王交谈
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

你需要尊称他为陛下
You will address him as Your Grace.

我知道他是正统国王 我父亲为他而死
I know he's the king. My father died for him.

陛下 我的名字是琼恩雪诺
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

你父亲是一位值得尊敬的人
Your father was an honorable man.

你认为他会如何处置野人头目呢? 
What do you think he'd have done with him?

我曾是他的阶下囚
I was this man's prisoner once.

他本可虐待我或杀死我
He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.

可他饶了我一命
But he spared my life.

我认为我父亲会将他囚禁起来 听听他会怎么说
I think my father would have taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.

好吧 那么把他关起来
Very well, then. Take him.

如果我父亲看到了我所经历的事情 他一定会建议您在夜幕降临之前焚毁尸体
If my father had seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.

我会建议用点罂粟花奶 减轻他的痛苦 可他已经彻底麻木了
I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.

这似乎是狮身蝎尾兽毒
The cause appears to be manticore venom.

嗯 是的 死神之首 狮身蝎尾兽
It is. The Death's Head manticore.

我曾阅读过许多相关书籍
Yes, I've read a great deal about it.

这是种非常恐怖的毒液
It's a horrible poison.

往往来自于曼达利
Usually Mantari in origin.

已经回天乏术了
There's nothing to be done.

我能请问一下阁下这是在做什么吗? 
May I ask what you think you're doing?

陛下 我很希望我们能有其他选择 不过格雷果爵士已经无药可救了
Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

这家伙连学士都不是 竟在这里充起大学士来了
This man is not even a maester, let alone Grand Maester.

学士们才不知道如何拯救他呢
No maester knows how to save him.

正是因为他如此傲慢 学城才决定开除他的 陛下
That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.

他所谓的好奇心违背自然 异常危险
His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.

我认为开除他真是明智的决定
Rightly so, in my opinion.

大学士 你可以离开了
You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

陛下 这可是我的实验室
But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

你能救他吗?  很难说 陛下
You can save him? Difficult to say, Your Grace.

但如果我过去的成果能派得上用场…
But if my past work is any guide...

… 我们也许有希望
...we stand a chance.

尽你一切力量救他
Do everything you can.

需要什么都请告诉我
Come to me for anything you need.

谢谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

不过您得知道 这一过程或许会让他… 有点变化. 
You should know, the process may change him...  somewhat.

我们已经讨论过这个 事情已经敲定了
We've been over this. The matter's closed.

可我想再谈一谈
I'm opening it again.

你已经与洛拉斯·提利尔订婚
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

眼下便是他的未婚妻
You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

等到托曼和玛格丽成婚时 便是洛拉斯·提利尔迎娶你之日
And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

詹姆不能结婚 也不能继承领土
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

提利昂的判决明天就要执行
Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow.

你曾经多次声称 愿为家族做出一切
You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family's future.

而现在 你对这个家族 比以往任何时候都重要
Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.

君临才是我的归宿, 我要跟我儿子一起留在这里, 他才是国王
I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son the king.

在你九岁那年 我被命令前往首都
When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital.

当时我决定带上你的弟弟 而不是你
I decided to take your brother with me and not you.

你却坚持无论在什么情况下 自己都不能被留在凯岩城 如果你还记得…
You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances. And if you recall

我没有兴趣听你在这里洋洋自得 复述你上次是怎么赢得争论的
I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won.

这次我不会再听你的摆布
This isn't going to be one of those times.

你以为你会是第一个 被强行拖到教堂成婚的人么? 
Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?

你那时大步踏入王座厅 告诉我我们赢得了黑水河之战… 你还记得么? 
When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle of Blackwaterdo you remember?

当时我和托曼坐在铁王座上
I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

我已经准备好喂他服下夜影之水
I was about to give him essence of nightshade.

一想到那些恶棍会把我的儿子夺走 我什么都做得出来
That's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away.

而现在 又有些恶棍要来把他夺走
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

弥赛菈像家畜一样被卖了出去
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

而你现在想把我送到高庭去 偷走我的孩子
And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.

玛格丽会把爪子伸出来 你也会把爪子伸出来 你们会像野兽一样 争夺他 直到把他撕成两半
Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart.

在此之前 我宁可先毁了我们的家族
I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.

你想做什么? 
And how will you do that?

我要将真相公之于众
I'll tell everyone the truth.

什么真相? 
What truth would that be?

你不知道 是么? 
You don't know, do you?

你从来不肯相信
You never believed it.

这怎么可能呢? 
How is that possible?

我在说什么呢? 这当然有可能
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

一个如此着魔于自己理想中家族理念的人 又怎么会对家族里真正发生的事情有一点概念呢? 
How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing?

我们当初就在你眼皮子底下 而你却视而不见
We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us.

过去二十年里如果你看过一眼 认真看一眼你自己的孩子们 你就该知道
One look in the past 20 years, one real look at your own children and you would have known.

他们说的都是真的
Everything they say is true.

詹姆和我的事 不
About Jaime and me. No.

你所谓的千秋家业就是个笑话  不 不 不 不
Your legacy is a lie. No, no, no, no.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

又少了一个弟弟 你一定很自豪吧
One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.

没有什么事情你做不出来的 是吧? 
There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?

为了我的家族 没有
For my family, no, nothing.

你无法想象我能为了家族做出什么事
I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.

提利昂是你的家人 他不是
Tyrion is your family. He's not.

这件事你无法选择 我可以 你也一样
You don't get to choose. I do. So do you.

你可以选择那个降生时害死我们母亲的东西…
You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world

你真的疯到认为他要为此负责? 
Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?

他没有想要害死她 他只是个婴儿
He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

疾病也没有想要杀死任何人
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

可你还是会在这之前把它除去
All the same, you cut it out before it does.

你想要的是什么? 你选择什么? 
What do you decide? What do you choose?

我为了回到你身边做的那些事 为了找回你而承受的痛苦…
The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you

你不过是说说 不
Those are words. Yes.

就像我刚跟父亲说的一样
Like the ones I just said to Father.

我告诉他我不会嫁给洛拉斯? 提利尔
I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

我告诉他我要呆在这里 跟托曼在一起 和你在一起
I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.

你认为他会就这么接受这个决定? 
You think he'll just accept that?

我不想再谈论泰温·兰尼斯特
I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

我没有选择泰温·兰尼斯特
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

我不爱泰温·兰尼斯特
I don't love Tywin Lannister.

别人会说闲话 会嘲笑我们
People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.

他们都那么渺小 我甚至看不到他们
They're all so small, I can't even see them.

我只看到最重要的
I only see what matters.

也许有人会进来
Someone will walk in.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

如果您需要的话 我也可以说通用语
I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

巴利斯坦·赛尔弥
'无畏的' 女王铁卫

你说得非常好
You speak it very well.

在您给我自由前 我属于米格达尔伟主
Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.

我是他孩子们的导师
I was tutor to his children.

我教导他们语言和历史
I taught them languages and history.

因为我 他们对您的家族非常了解
They know a great deal about your family because of me.

小卡拉只有七岁 但她非常仰慕您
Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.

我希望我能配得上她的仰慕
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

我能为你做什么? 
What can I do for you?

您占领城市时 孩子们乞求我 不要离开他们的家
When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house.

可米格达尔伟主和我都认为我必须离开
But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

现在只能睡在街上
Now I live on the streets.

我安排了食堂和棚屋 给曾经的奴隶提供伙食和住宿
I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

我无意冒犯 女王陛下
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

我去过那些地方
I went to one of these places.

年轻人欺压老者
The young prey on the old.

随意抢夺想要的东西 还殴打反抗者
Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

我的无垢者会尽快恢复秩序保证安全 朋友 我向你保证
My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend, this I promise you.

即使那些地方安全了 我在那儿算什么? 
Even if they are safe, who would I be there?

我生活的目标是什么? 
What purpose would I serve?

在我的主人家里 我是一个老师
With my master, I was a teacher.

他的孩子们尊敬我 爱戴我
I had the respect and love of his children.

你到底想要什么? 
What is it that you want from me?

女王陛下 我请求您 让我把自己卖回给米格达尔伟主
Your Grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

你想回到拥有你的人那里 像他拥有的一只山羊 一把椅子一样? 
You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair?

年轻人也许会在您为他们建立的新世界里欣喜若狂 但我们这些经受不住变化的老家伙 却只能在这个世界里恐惧而凄惨地活着
The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them, but for those of us too old to change, there is only fear and squalor.

外面还有很多人等着向您请求同样的事情
There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.

我解放了这里的人民 并不是为了给他们套上同样的枷锁
I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy.

我占领这里是为了给人民带来自由
I took it to bring people freedom.

但自由意味着由你自己做决定
But freedom means making your own choices.

我允许你与你之前的主人签订合同
I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.

但合同的期限不能超过一年
It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.

谢谢 女王陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

伟主们会利用这一点钻空子
The masters will take advantage of this situation.

那些为他们服务的人 实际上还是奴隶
The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.

他从天上飞来
He came from the sky.

他从天上飞来 然后…
He came from the sky and...

她几岁?  三岁
How old was she? Three.

他们中有的来自白港和荒冢屯 也有的来自美人市集和君临 从北到南 从东到西
They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west.

他们为保护男女老少而死 身后却籍没无闻
They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names.

我们应铭记他们
It is for us to remember them.

铭记我们的兄弟 我们将难得再见如此之人
Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.

他们的守望至死方休 于斯结束
And now their watch is ended.

他们的守望至死方休 于斯结束
And now their watch is ended.

So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?

从长城上扔下去? 
Drop us from the top of the Wall?

我不知道他们会怎么对囚犯
I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

我猜是史坦尼斯
I suppose Stannis does.

你跟我们在一起待得太久 琼恩·雪诺
You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.

再也不是下跪之人了
You can never be a kneeler again.

我们要把你们那边的死尸也烧了

你有什么话要对他们说的吗? 
Do you want to say any words over them?

话? 什么话? 
Words? What kind of words?

随我来 布兰登·史塔克
Come with me, Brandon Stark.

随我们来 要么就随他而死
Come with me or die with him.

他们没法追来
They cannot follow us.

那些驱役他们的力量在这里无能为力
The power that moves them is powerless here.

先民叫我们森林之子 但我们早在他们之前就已存在了
The First Men called us the children, but we were born long before them.

来 他正等着你呢
Come, he waits for you.

您就是三眼乌鸦? 
You're the threeeyed raven?

我有过诸多经历

马哪儿去了? 
Where are the horses?

我昨晚把它们栓好了

我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

我不再是原来的我了
I'm a different person now.

我在七神的光耀下找到了平静
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

他们注视着每一个人 随时赐予仁慈 和公正
They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy or justice.

他们的纪元即将到来
Their world is at hand.

我会为您父亲的灵魂祈祷
I will pray for your father's soul.

等到泰温・兰尼斯特的灵魂需要你帮助的那天吧…
The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help...

这看上去像多恩 不像
It looks like Dorne. It doesn't.

这里是…  这儿是阳戟城
That's thethat's the Sunspear bit right there.

这里是多恩的山脉
And that's where the mountains are.

而这边是… 沙蛇城? 
And over here is is Sunsnake?

根据我的经历 我想我们会过得很愉快
I think we would have a lovely time, judging by my experience.

那再好不过了 多恩 高庭 随便哪里
That would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden.

我们要赶不上晚宴了
We're late for dinner as it is.

你好有礼貌
You're very respectful.

恐怕我的哥哥 让国王等急了 奥利法
I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

也许你该考虑做事小心一些? 
Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?

反正他们都知道
They all know about me anyway.

是个人都对人了如指掌
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

在这样的地方试着保守秘密有什么意义? 
What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?

无论如何 你不该让你的未婚妻等着
In any event, you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

这意味着没有人能强迫瑟曦嫁给我
That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.

你运气真好 可惜不是你的
Lucky you. Unlucky you.

你以为我想那个女人嫁给我哥哥? 
You think I want that woman married to my brother?

如果她不嫁给我 她就不会去高庭
If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden.

这意味着她会留在君临
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

意味着你会被困在这儿 跟瑟曦・兰尼斯特在一起 而她还是你婆婆
Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

太监 蜘蛛 情报总管
Eunuch, the Spider, the Master of Whisperers.

要自杀有更快的方式
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

你的名头不少 朋友 但没有懦夫
You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.

你从没提过为什么要救我
You never told me why you set me free.

你哥哥让我这么做
Your brother asked me to.

拒绝弑君者? 这太危险了
Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.

放我出来更加危险
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

你在赌命 还搭进去了地位 甚或一切
You risked your life, your position, everything.

为什么? 你不是我家人 不欠我什么
Why? You're not family. You owe me nothing.

我不是为了你才这么做的
I didn't do it for you.

我是为了七大王国
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

一个醉醺醺的侏儒做不了七国的救世主
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

我不相信什么救世主
I don't believe in saviors.

我相信有才能的人 在眼前的战争中应扮演的角色
I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come.

那你该找个战士
You're going to have to find another soldier.

我受够维斯特洛了 维斯特洛也受够了我
I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.

你拥有许多让人钦佩的品质 自怨自艾可不是其中之一
You have many admirable qualities, selfpity is not one of them.

一个蠢货只要有点运气 就可能天生握有权力
Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power.

但通过自己努力得到 却要费一番功夫
But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

我不擅长做费功夫的事
I'm not wellsuited for work.

你有你父亲的政治直觉
You have your father's instincts for politics.

你还有同情心
And you have compassion.

我亲手杀死了自己的爱人
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

我拿十字弓射死了自己的父亲
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

我从没说你是个完美的人
I never said you were perfect.

你到底想要什么? 
What is it you want exactly?

一个当权者不会压榨平民的国度
A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.

那里姜饼堆满了城堡 黑莓酒溢满了护城河
Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.

历来当权者都是要压榨平民的
The powerful have always preyed on the powerless.

他们当初就是这样上位的
That's how they became powerful in the first place.

或许我们已经习惯了恐惧 以至于以为没有其它的出路
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror, we assume there's no other way.

如果你坐在铁王座上 你会让痛苦在王国中蔓延么? 
If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?

我永远不会坐上铁王座
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

但你可以帮助其他人登上那台阶 坐上那王座
But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat.

七国需要一个比托曼更强大 但比史坦尼斯更温和的人
The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis.

一个可以威慑住领主 又能激励人民的君王
A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people.

一个手握重兵 受万人爱戴的统治者 并冠有恰当的姓氏
A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.

愿你能找到这样一个好国王
Good luck finding him.

谁说一定是国王? 
Who said anything about 'him'?

你有两个选择 朋友
You have a choice, my friend.

你可以呆在伊利里欧的宫殿里 醉生梦死 你也可以跟我一起前往弥林 见一见丹妮莉丝・坦格利安 再下结论说这世界还值不值得为之奋斗一番
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Meereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.

我可以在去弥林的路上醉生梦死么? 
Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?

什么时候无垢者开始在弥林的街道上巡逻了? 
When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

看来你的朋友做事并不规矩
Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.

我们在渊凯获得了巨大的成功
Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.

渊凯的贤主同意让权于 由自由民众和曾经的奴隶主 组成的议会
The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed men and the former slaveholders.

所有后续事项都会呈请您的批准
All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.

但他们也请求能有一些退让
They did ask for some concessions.

政治是一门相互妥协的艺术 陛下
Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace.

我不是政客 我是女王
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

抱歉 理所当然 您才是正确的
Forgive me.You're right, of course.

不过 统御愉快的臣民要比统御愤怒的臣民要容易
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.

我不指望那些明主们乐在其中
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

奴隶制使他们盆满钵满, 而我终结了奴隶制
Slavery made them rich.I ended slavery.

他们并没有要复辟奴隶制
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

他们想要重开角斗场
They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.

那个奴隶与奴隶相互残杀 至死方休的地方? 
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

在您带给我们的这个新世界里 相斗的是自由民与自由民了
In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men.

您解放的那些角斗士们 为能有机会重新上场而恳求着
The pit fighters you liberated plead for this opportunity.

您可以召见他们 亲自询问
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

开启它们将向渊凯和弥林的人们 展现您对他们传统的尊重
Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.

我不尊重人与人相残犹如斗鸡的传统
I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

如果您…  还要我说多少次'不'你才能懂? 
If youHow many times must I say no before you understand?

不管他想从我这里得到什么 他都不会如愿的
Whatever he wants from me,he's not going to get it.

如果他真的以为我会重开角斗场...
If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

您是应该重开角斗场
You should reopen the fighting pits.

我母亲是个妓女 我告诉过您的
My mother was a whore. I told you that.

她喜欢喝梨子白兰地
She liked to drink pear brandy.

她越是年老 越是做不成皮肉生意 也就越想要酗酒
The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink.

于是我十二岁的时候 她把我卖给了前一天晚上 刚刚跟她干过的奴隶贩子
So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.

为什么? 我是个坏小子
Why? I was a bad child.

我块头不大 但身手敏捷
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

而且热衷于战斗
And I loved to fight.

于是他们把我卖给了一个脱罗斯人 那人为角斗场训练斗士
So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits.

我十六岁那年第一次上场
I had my first match when I was 16.

你被卖为奴隶 被迫战斗到死 以供奴隶主消遣 而你却维护角斗场的存在? 
You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?

没有角斗场 就没有今天的我
I'm only here because of those pits.

我学着如何像多斯拉克咆哮武士一样战斗 像诺佛斯的僧侣 维斯特洛的骑士一样战斗
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

当我步入角斗场 上万男女尖声呼叫着我的名字
10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit.

我让自己主人的口袋里塞满了钱 他死的时候 给了我自由
I made so much money for my master, he set me free when he died.

我加入了次子团
I joined the Second Sons.

人人对您畏惧有加 不敢说出真相
Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.

在狭海两岸 您结下了数千敌人
You've made thousands of enemies all across the world.

只要他们察觉到您的虚弱 便会发动进攻
As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack.

此时此地 您要展现自己的力量
Show your strength here, now.

这就是我让无垢者上街巡逻的原因
That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.

任何人只要提着一箱金子都能买到无垢者
Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

您不是无垢者之母
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

您是龙之母
You're the Mother of Dragons.

我不想让自己的脚边再多一个孩子的遗骨了
I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet.

已经好几个周没人见过卓耿了
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

据我所知 他已飞到了半个世界之外
For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world.

我再无法驾驭它们了
I can't control them anymore.

没了龙的龙女王 不是真女王
A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.

当初我们第一次见面 你是我的阶下囚
When we first met, you were my prisoner.

现在 在我们的最后一次见面上...
And now, for our last meeting...

这次见面并不一定非得是最后一次
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

你知道史坦尼斯想要什么? 
You know what Stannis wants?

他要我屈膝降服
He wants me to bend the knee.

想要自由民为他而战
And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

我得承认 他很英勇
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

国王不应该英勇吗? 
Shouldn't a king be bold?

若是他能如愿以偿
If he gets what he wants,

我觉得他会是个比近百年来 那些铁王座上的傻瓜们更加称职的统治者
I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years.

但我绝不会效忠于他
But I'll never serve him.

你告诉过我 你并非来此攻城略地
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

你说过你的人民已经流够了鲜血
You told me your people have bled enough.

我也不想让他们为史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩而流血
I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

你费尽周折说服 90 个氏族有史以来 头一次团结一心
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history.

瑟恩人与硬足民 大冰川的食人部落 甚至是巨人
Thenns and Hornfoots, the iceriver clans, even the giants.

你耗尽毕生心血将它们团结起来 非为权力
A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power.

非为荣耀
You didn't do it for glory.

你集结于此 只为拯救他们 因为即便他们生于长城以北 也无法在凛冬之中幸存
You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the Wall.

他们的性命难道不比你的骄傲 要更加重要吗? 
Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

这与此无关
This isn't about that.

那就屈膝 救你的人一命吧
Then bend the knee and save your people.

他们追随我是因为他们尊敬我
They followed me because they respected me.

因为他们相信我
Because they believed in me.

若我向南方来的国王屈膝 他们片刻间就会作鸟兽散
The moment I kneel for a southern king, that's all gone.

那么外面现在有几千几万个人? 
And how many tens of thousands are out there right now?

多少女人? 多少孩子? 
How many women? How many children?

你不愿走出去拯救他们于水火, 原因何在? 
And you won't go out and rescue them because why?

因为你怕自己看起来像是吓破了胆
You're afraid of looking afraid.

他们要怎么行刑? 砍头? 
How will they do it? Beheading?

他们要活活烧死你
They'll burn you alive.

实话实说
I'll be honest with you.

我不想我面目焦黑 尖叫而死的一幕 被我的人记在脑袋里
I don't want people to remember me like that, scorched and screaming.

但即便如此 也比背叛我所信仰的一切要好得多
But it's better than betraying everything I believe.

那你的人民又将如何呢? 
And what happens to your people?

你保全了自己的尊严 光荣地死去了 他们会传唱你的歌谣
You preserve your dignity and die standing and they'll sing songs about you.

说你宁愿被烧死也不屈膝
You'd rather burn than kneel.

随后凛冬降临 白鬼向我们所有人袭来 于是传唱之人将无一幸免于难
Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there's no one left to sing.

但如果你无法理解为什么我不让自己的人民 去参加一场外邦人的战争的话 就没什么好解释的
But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining.

我认为你犯了个很严重的错误
I think you're making a terrible mistake.

有自己做出错误决定的自由 曾是我最大的奢求
The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.

曼斯・雷德 你曾被称为塞外之王
Mance Rayder, you've been called the KingbeyondtheWall.

而维斯特洛仅有唯一真王
Westeros only has one king.

屈膝臣服 我饶你不死
Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

我曾在这儿住了许多年
This was my home for many years.

我希望你在未来的战争中 能交上好运
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

无论男女老幼 高低贵贱 都面临同样的选择
Man or woman, young or old, ord or peasant, our choices are the same.

选择光明抑或黑暗
We choose light or we choose darkness.

选择善良或者邪恶
We choose good or we choose evil.

选择真神或者伪神
We choose the true god or the false.

自由民们 这里只有一位真王 他的名字是史坦尼斯
Free folk, there is only one true king and his name is Stannis.

这里站着你们的伪王
Here stands your king of lies.

看那 这便是选择黑暗之人的命运
Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.

在过去 每当布拉佛斯面临危险 泰坦巨人就会双目带火 迈开大步 涉水入海 碾碎敌人
In old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the Titan would step with fire in its eyes, wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

哈哈 别怕 他在宣布我们的到来呢
Haha. Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.

这就是黑白之院
The House of Black and White.

在这里你会找到要找的人
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

谢谢你把我带到这里来 布拉佛斯的每一个人都会这么做的
Thank you for bringing me. Any man in Braavos would have done the same.

凡人皆有一死 凡人皆须侍奉
Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.

这个是贾昆·赫加尔给我的
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

无人唤作此名 求你了!
No one here by that name. Please!

我一路穿过狭海而来 除了这里我无处可去
I've crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.

任何地方都可以是你的去处 等一下!
You have everywhere else to go. But wait!

瑟曦… 瓦德·佛雷…
Cersei...Walder Frey...

魔山… 马林·特兰
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

瑟曦… 瓦德·佛雷…
Cersei...Walder Frey...

魔山… 马林·特兰
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

这么多客人 吃的一定不错
Must be good food if it's crowded.

我们走之前 有学士交给你一封渡鸦带来的信
Before we left, a maester gave you a raven's scroll.

你成了个观察越来越敏锐的姑娘
You are becoming an observant young lady.

我的母亲曾说'黑色的翅膀 带来黑色的消息'
My mother used to say 'dark wings dark words'.

那是句古话 可这次它落空了
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

我的求婚成功了
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

我还以为你仍在哀悼我挚爱的莱莎姨妈呢
I thought you still mourned the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

怎么了?  是珊莎·史塔克 别回头看!
What is it? Sansa Stark. Don't look!

她染过头发 但那就是她
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

她的旁边坐着培提尔·贝里席
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

他们身边还有一帮骑士
A bunch of knights with them.

一帮? 一帮是有几个? 六个? 二十个? 
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?

我觉得有十来个 太多了
Ten, I think. Too many.

小姐 我不认为现在…
My Lady, I don't think this is...

我们只有一匹马
We only have one horse.

喜欢酒的味道吗? 
Do you like the taste?

我不明白酒有什么好稀罕的
Don't see what all the fuss is about.

男人为什么就这么喜欢喝酒? 
Why do men love it so much?

有些男人靠它壮胆
It gives some men courage.

能给你壮胆吗? 
Does it give you courage?

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

我们见过面 和蓝礼·拜拉席恩一起
We've met, with Renly Baratheon.

他是怎么形容你的来着? 
What did he say about you?

你的忠诚千金难买
Your loyalty came free of charge.

看来后来有人是花了大价钱才把它给买走了
Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.

令堂健在时
Before your mother's death,

我是她的誓言剑士
I was her sworn sword.

我曾发誓要找到你 保护你
I gave my word I will find you and protect you.

我会守护你的安危 充当你的智囊 如有必要 便献出我的生命
I will shield your back and keep your counsel, and give my life for you if needs be.

我以新旧诸神之名发此誓
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

布蕾妮小姐 请别这样
Please, Lady Brienne.

没必要如此一本正经
No need for such formality.

你当过凯特琳·史塔克的誓言剑士
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.

我从孩提时代就认识凯特了 她可从来没提过你呢
I knew Cat since the time we were children. She never mentioned you.

那是蓝礼遇刺之后的事
It was after Renly's murder.

你被指控刺杀了他
You were accused of killing him.

但你却受到了指控 指控我的人没有亲眼看见事情的经过
But you were accused. By men who did not see what happened.

他被一道影子杀了
He was murdered by a shadow.

那道影子长着史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的脸
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

这个女人发誓保护蓝礼周全 结果失败了
This woman swore to protect Renly, she failed.

她发誓保护你的母亲 又失败了
She swore to protect your mother, she failed.

为什么我要把珊莎小姐交给总是失败的你来保护? 
Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

她的事情与你又有何干? 
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

我是她的姨夫
Because I am her uncle.

我与她的莱莎姨妈结为连理 可怜婚后不久我的爱人香消玉殒
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death.

我们现在成了一家人 而你是个外人
We're family now. And you are an outsider.

请原谅我 布蕾妮小姐
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.

经历使然 我并不信任外人
But experience has made me wary of outsiders.

珊莎小姐… 如果我能和您单独谈谈…  算了吧
Lady Sansa...  if we can have a word alone... No.

拜托了 小姐 如果我可以向您解释…  我在乔佛里的婚礼上看见你 正对着国王鞠恭敬礼
Please, my Lady, if I can explain... I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...  bowing to the king.

你我都不想去的
Neither of us wanted to be there.

有时我们别无选择 而有时我们可以选择
Sometimes we don't have a choice. And sometimes we do.

我不希望我们的新朋友在乡间独自游荡
We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone.

这一带的道路可不太平
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

我说 你给我站住
I'm gonna ask you to stay.

停下! 停下! 抓住他!
Stop! Stop! After him!

停下 停下 停下 停下!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

乖马儿 朝这儿走
That's a good boy. Come on.

看来你手无寸铁
Guess that means you're unarmed.

对陌生人充满警惕 她当然应该如此
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

我看见她和小指头一道朝东边骑过去了
I saw her riding on the Eastroad with Littlefinger.

我们跟上去 小姐… 如果史塔克家的两位小姐都拒绝你的效忠 也许你可以从誓言中解脱出来了
We'll follow them. My Lady...  if both Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow.

我向她们的母亲发过誓 我会保护她们
I swore to their mother I would protect those girls.

但她们并不想要你的保护
They don't want your protection.

那你觉得她和小指头一起安全吗? 
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?

太后陛下召我何事
A summons from the Queen.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

这个世界上只有两件这样的项链
There are only two like it in the world.

我正戴着其中一条 还有一条我给了弥赛菈
The one I'm wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.

这当然是恐吓
Of course it's a threat.

我们的女儿在多恩形单影只 周围全是我们家族的仇敌
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family.

他们把奥柏伦和他姐姐的死
They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister.

还有他们那受诅咒的土地上发生的 每一出悲剧全都归咎于我们
And every other tragedy that has befallen their accursed country.

他们要是敢动她一下 我就让他们的城市灰飞烟灭
I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her.

我们的女儿身处险境 而你还在担心我说话太大声? 
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried I am speaking too loudly?

不能让别人知道她是我们的女儿
No one can know she's our daughter.

那就别说她是你的女儿
Then don't call her your daughter.

你从来没做过她的父亲
You've never been a father to her.

如果我有了孩子 他们就会当街被乱石砸死
If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.

那你的小心谨慎又换来了什么呢? 
And what has your caution brought?

我们的大儿子在自己的婚宴上被谋害 惟一的女儿被装船送去多恩 小儿子还得娶那个满脸假笑的高庭婊子!
Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding, our only daughter shipped off to Dorne, our baby boy set to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden!

我会让一切都好起来的
I'm gonna make things better.

你从来没让什么事情好起来过
You've never made anything better.

把我们的女儿带回家
And I'm bringing our daughter home.

你不可能从道朗亲王手里把她讨回来
You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back.

她已经被许配给他儿子了
She's promised to his son.

我不找他交涉
I'm not going to ask him anything.

你要是率军前往 那就是宣战
You go down there with an army it's an act of war.

你知道她被关在哪里么? 
Do you know where they're keeping her?

奥柏伦提到过流水花园
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

流水花园: 流水花园是曾经的多恩统治者送给坦格利安新娘的礼物, 一座由喷泉和花园构成的宫殿, 
位于海滩边. 多恩各地的家庭都会将孩子送来流水花园抚养, 玩耍. 

还有别的事吗 陛下? 
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

你要去多恩
You're going to Dorne.

谁说只有我一个人的? 
Who said I was going alone?

不要向日葵 我不喜欢黄色
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

玫瑰很不错 就选玫瑰
Roses are very nice, definitely roses.

还要有音乐 我喜欢音乐
And music. I adore music.

我讨厌听长笛 你喜欢的话可以有竖琴 但不要长笛
I hate flutes. We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes.

接下来还得安排吃的
Then there's the food.

吃的最重要 是吧? 
The food is the most important thing, don't you agree?

我们需要鸽子派
We're gonna need pigeon pies.

君临人都好这一口 对吧? 
That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?

君临人吃鸽子派
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

确实如此 亲爱的
They certainly do, my dear.

这真是个好地方啊
It's a fine place, isn't it?

我从未想过能在这样一个地方安定下来
I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.

我们不会在史铎克渥斯堡住下来
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

当母亲逝去之后 姐姐会继承城堡 因为她是老大
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.

她用刻薄的小名叫唤我 有时 她趁母亲没有注意 拽我的头发
She calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother's not looking.

你知道我怎么想的么? 
You know what I think?

我认为你是个好人
I think you're a good person.

而且你的姐姐是个坏人
And your sister is a mean person.

我曾周游世界 要说我从中学到一个什么道理 那就是世界总是充满恶意
I've been all over the world and if there's one thing I've learned, is that meanness comes around.

像你姐姐这类人 他们终将恶有恶报
People like your sister, they always get what's coming for them, eventually.

詹姆·他妈的·兰尼斯特
Jaime fucking Lannister.

黑水的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

对令尊的逝世我表示非常遗憾
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

这是我的未婚妻 洛丽丝
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

你选了个年轻漂亮的新娘
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

婚期定了吗? 
When are you planning on getting married?

你来的目的
What you're here for.

无事不登三宝殿
There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.

这回是好事
It's very good for you.

洛丽丝将要嫁给威利斯·布莱肯爵士
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.

我们有过协议 我和你姐姐
We've made a deal, your sister and I.

我反对
I would have advised against that.

这也叫好事? 
How is this good for me?

因为你要跟我走一趟 帮我完成重要的任务
Because you're going to come with me and help me with something important.

等我们回来…
And when we return...

我会给你更好的女人和更好的城堡
I'm gonna give you a much better girl and a much better castle.

南方的尽头
As far south as south goes.

亲王殿下想要清静 暂不见客
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

别挡我道 不然我会用那把长斧好好修理一下你的…
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your...

队长… 让她过来
Captain...  let her pass.

您的弟弟被谋杀了… 你却坐在这流水花园里 看着天空什么都不做
Your brother was murdered...  and you sit here in the Water Gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing.

奥柏伦死于比武审判 依照律法 不算他杀
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law, that is no murder.

您的弟弟…  不需要你来提醒我
Your brother... You don't have to remind me.

他跟你没怎样的时候 就一直是我弟弟了
He was my brother long before he was anything to you.

他的后事你怎么料理? 
What will you do about his death?

安葬他 哀悼他
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

你希望我发动战争
You would have me go to war.

整个国家都希望你发动战争
The whole country would have you go to war.

那么我们应该庆幸国家做不了主
Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.

沙蛇们站在我这边
The Sand Snakes are with me.

她们有人民的爱戴
They have the love of their people.

她们会为父亲报仇 而你却坐在这里无所事事
They will avenge their father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

而这个兰尼斯特丫头却还在流水花园里蹦蹦跳跳 吃我们的饭 吸我们的气
And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air.

你还想要等多少兄弟姐妹 被他们屠杀? 
How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?

让我给瑟曦送去她的指头 一次一根
Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.

而你曾给他带来快乐
And you made him very happy.

为此 你也一直都在我心里有一席之地
For that, you will always have a place in my heart.

但是我们不靠折磨小女孩来复仇
But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance.

那你觉得还能坐多久? 
And how long would that be?

无垢者太显眼了
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

任何人都能在一里之外看到他们
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.

当然你们就找不到鹰身女妖之子
'Course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy.

没错吧? 
You haven't, have you?

可是我的次子团呢… 吃喝嫖赌 巷斗拿手 他们吃得开
My Second Sons on the other hand...  they drink, they whore, fight in streets, they blend in.

他们在酒馆旁听消息
They overhear things in taverns.

从酒馆跟踪人到安静的巷子里
Follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys.

打断几根指头 打听点信儿… 在你能反应过来之前就搞定了…
Break a few fingers, overhear a few more things...  before you know it...

无垢者无惧
Unsullied fear nothing.

你也曾知道恐惧意味着什么 但早就忘了
You understood fear once, long ago, but you forgot what it means.

连恐惧都忘掉的人… 也会忘记如何躲藏
Someone who's forgotten fear...  has forgotten how to hide.

恐惧可以教你躲藏
Fear is useful that way.

鹰身女妖之子… 他们想重新把颈圈套回我的脖子上
Sons of the Harpy...  they want to put a collar back on my neck.

套回所有的脖子上 求您了 陛下 您必须杀了他 杀鸡儆猴
On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace...  you must kill him. It would send a message.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

我觉得您不应该操之过急…
I think you should exercise restraint...

巴利斯坦·赛尔弥
'无畏的' 女王铁卫

嗯 首先 他可能提供有用的信息
Well, for one thing, he may have valuable information.

但 鹰身女妖之子没什么太多值得榨取的消息
Well, the Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.

你怎么知道? 
How do you know that?

因为我问过他了
Because I questioned him.

您确实得到了消息… 他还年轻并且…
And the information you did get... he is young and..

那他为什么要做回奴隶? 
Why should he want to bring back slavery?

这对他有什么好处? 
What did it do for him?

或许唯一能让他有骄傲的资本 就是让他知道还有人比他更加低贱
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.

有势力的家族 不愿意亲自动手
Great families, afraid to do a thing.

他们出钱雇佣穷人去替他们卖命
They pay poor men to do it for them.

那你怎么知道这个? 
And how do you know this?

每个人都知道 我不知道
Everyone know this. I don't know it.

而我就是一个大家族的首领
And I'm the head of a great family.

我们不知道这个人做了什么 没做什么
We do not know what this man did or didn't do.

至少给他一次审判吧
Give him a trial at least.

给所有弥林的人民看看 你比那些想要推翻你的人更好
Show all the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose you.

告诉他们文明社会是什么样的
Teach them a better way.

我不知道老骑士从何而来
I do not know the place from where old ser comes.

可能你们那里处事不同
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

但是在这 在弥林 在'风暴降生'丹妮莉丝到来之前 他们奴役我们
But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn they own us.

所以我们了解他们… 否则早就死光了
So we learn much about them...  or we do not live long.

他们的嘴脸我早已认清
They teach me what they are.

怜悯 公正的审判… 这些对他们来说毫无意义
Mercy, fair trial...  these mean nothing to them.

他们所理解的只有鲜血
All they understand is blood.

感谢你们的意见和建议
Thank you all for your council.

陛下… 请听我一言 求您了
Your Grace...  a word, please, I beg you.

关于疯王 疯王? 
About the Mad King. The Mad King?

你是想再重复一遍逆贼的谣言么? 
You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?

那就再听一遍
Consider me reminded.

我曾是他的御林铁卫
I served in his Kingsguard.

很早就随侍左右
I was at his side from the first.

他们没有说谎
Your enemies did not lie.

当人们站起来反抗他的统治时 您的父亲割下了他们的舌头扔进火堆
When the people rose and revolted against him your father set their tongues cast them in flames.

在父亲面前杀掉儿子
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

用野火将人活活烧死 在他们痛苦尖叫的时候他狂笑不止 他的这些举动导致了内患重重 最终引起的叛乱战争 害死了所有的坦格利安族人 仅有两个幸存
He burned men alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed, and his efforts to stamp out dissent led to a rebellion that killed every Targaryen...  except two.

确实 陛下 感谢诸神
No, Your Grace, thank the gods.

可疯王自以为对敌人的处置是公正的
But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.

而且每次 这都让他感受到权力… 和正义感… 直到最后
And each time, it made him feel powerful...  and right...  until the very end.

在鹰身女妖之子接受公正审判前 我是不会处死他们的
I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.

是啊 最好小心点
Yes, best be careful.

你多少也吃点东西吧
You might accidentally consume some solid food.

我说要跟你走的时候 原话可没歧义吧? 
When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions?

除此之外 在这破箱子里我还能做什么? 
Besides, what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box?

你不喜欢?  我想出去走走
You don't like it? I want to take a walk.

瑟曦放出话来 谁献上你的人头 就封他为领主
Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.

她应该为他分开双腿
She ought to offer her cunt.

我身上最好的部分换她身上最好的部分
Best part of her for the best part of me.

呃 这样说来 我看被装在盒子里也好不到哪儿去
Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.

我们真的要一直讨论这些毫无意义的事情吗?  去瓦兰提斯的路可远着
Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything.

你说得对 毫无意义
You're right, there's no point.

去瓦兰提斯? 
The road to Volantis?

你不是说去弥林么 去瓦兰提斯干嘛? 
You said we are going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?

到了弥林之后你想找到什么呢? 
And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?

但是你已经有一个统治者了
But you've already got a ruler.

大家都有统治者
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

这路上随便一坨屎 都插着不知道谁家的旗帜
Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.

你挺能干的 你知道吗? 
You are quite good, do you know?

在你短暂的首相任期
During your brief tenure as Hand.

我那哪里是治国 我不过是个仆人
I didn't rule, I was a servant.

不过 依然是个人才
Still, a man of talent.

比方说很会杀人? 
Managed to kill a lot of people?

不错 不过你在其他方面也很有潜力
Yes, but you showed great promise in other areas as well.

她劝我离开君临
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

权力… 即便只是个仆人
Power...  even as a servant.

人们追随首领 但却永远不会追随我们
People follow leaders and they will never follow us.

他们说我们让人讨厌
They find us repulsive.

我们也觉得他们讨厌 所以 我们把自己搁在舒服的大盒子里 远离他们
And we find them... repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away.

然而… 不管我们怎么做… 像你我这样的人 永远无法满足于困在盒子之内
And yet...  no matter what we do...  people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box.

那我们来散个步吧 不行
Let's go for a walk. No.

这个世界上有多少侏儒? 
How many dwarves are there in the world?

难道瑟曦要把他们都杀了不成? 
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

你们想骗太后? 
You're trying to deceive your queen?

要我把他关起来吗 陛下? 
Should I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

没那个必要 马林爵士
It won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

我可不想让其他的猎人灰心
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

错误是难免的
Mistakes will be made.

谢谢您 陛下 谢谢
Thank you, Your Grace. Thanks.

谢谢您 陛下 谢谢您
Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.

如果您不介意 把这颗头给我吧
I would take it if you don't mind.

我的研究用得到
It could prove useful for my work.

放那边就好
Over there would be fine.

听见了吗 拿那边去
You heard the man, over there.

这是国王之手的座位
You're the hand of the King.

显然这个职位并不是给女人准备的
Clearly, it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role.

等我儿子成年了 他会任命自己的首相 我不过暂时替他代理国事
I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

陛下 我愿意暂代首相一职 直到国王成年之…  您是个好人 提利尔大人 但是我怕您难以分身
Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes full... You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine we'll have the time.

除了海政大臣之外 国王决定任命您为财务大臣
In addition to be Master of Ships, the King has appointed you Master of Coin.

他说您在财政方面的经验和智慧无人能及
He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled.

他说他将很荣幸由您来代表皇家利益
He said he would be honored to have you represent the Crown's interest in the same.

这是我的荣幸 陛下
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

陛陛陛下 从前 在某些情况下 大学士也曾代理过首相职务
YYYour Grace, in the past, on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.

国王已经任命科本为新的情报总管
The King's named Qyburn the new Master of Whispers.

陛下 这这个人? 这这个学城的耻辱? 
Your Grace, thisthis man? ThThis embarassment to the Citadel?

陛下… 他何德何能担此大任? 
Your Grace...  what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?

就凭他的忠诚 大学士
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

远超之前那个太监
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

以及其他很多人
Far more than many ever have.

我得说…  我不能…
I must say... I can not...

凯冯叔叔 作为兰尼斯特军队的指挥官 如果你愿意出任军务大臣 国王会非常高兴的
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as Commander of the Lannister Armies, it would please the King if you would serve as his Master of War.

没有人比你更适合这个职位了
No man living better deserves the title.

你这么说太客气了
That is kind of you to say.

不过我想听国王本人跟我说
I would like to hear it from the King himself.

国王这会儿可没空
Well, the King is very busy at this moment.

他应该来这儿的 学习治国之道
He should be here, learning what it means to rule.

而这一次 作为统治者 他指定我代言
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

我回君临是来向我哥哥致敬的 也向你致意 也为了向国王效命
I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother, and to you, and to serve the King.

而不是回来当你的木偶
I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet.

看你把御前会议搞得乌烟瘴气
To watch you stack the Small Council with sycophants.

把你的兄弟赶走…
Sending your own brother away...

我的弟弟是去执行秘密的外交任务
My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

这和你这个军务大臣没什么关系
That is not your concern as Master of War.

我可不认为你有权力命令我 告诉我哪些事情该我关心
I do not recognize your authority to dictat what is and is not my concern.

你是国王的母亲
You are the Queen Mother.

在你的国王急需你的时候 你要抛弃他吗? 
You would abandon your king in his time of need?

如果他真要找我 我在凯岩城
If he wants to send for me, I'll be waiting for him.

加油 你认识这个的
Come on, you know this one.

它看起来像个动物
It looks like an animal.

是个'S' 对 很好
It's an 'S'. Right, very good.

山姆威尔·塔利
'杀手' 守夜人事务官

嘿 你们知道吗?  史上最年轻的总司令欧斯里克·史塔克
Hmm, did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history,

被选上的时候只有 10 岁
Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?

你会学会的 我保证
You'll learn, I promise.

老人家学新事物可慢了
Old people are terrible at learning new things.

当然 你是个很棒的老师
Well, you are a wonderful teacher.

我不过是跟你说识字这事 熟能生巧
I only said that the more time that you spend practicing the faster you will be able to read.

我们进展不错
We're doing just fine.

我想你跟欧斯里克·史塔克还有很多要聊的
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.

你几岁识的字? 
How old were you when you learned how to read?

是你母亲教你的吗? 
Were you taught by your mother?

是我们的克里森学士
Our Maester Cressen did.

我有好多时间可以用来练习 我母亲不让我出去 因为...
I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...

你们南方人叫它什么?  你脸上的这个
What do you call it in the south? What happened to your face.

在长城以北你们叫它什么? 
What would you call it in the north of the Wall?

但是我有两个姐姐得了这个 他们都死了
But two of my sisters had it. They both died.

他们怎么治好你的? 
How did they cure you?

我不记得了 那会儿我还是婴儿
I don't remember. I was a baby.

肯定来了很多人用了很多方法 我想
A lot of people came and tried, I think.

不管怎样 这病是好了
Whatever they did, it went away.

你的姐姐们发生了什么
What happened to your sisters?

我父亲把她们都赶出去了 赶出了堡垒
My father made them move out to the keep, outside.

不许我们接近她们
None of us were allowed to go near them.

但是我们都能听到她们 尤其是夜里
But we heard them, especially at night.

她们听起来越来越不像她们
They started to sound not like themselves.

你见过她们吗? 
Did you ever see them?

只见过一次 在最后的时候
Only once, at the end.

那东西盖满了她们全身
They were covered with it.

她们的脸上 手上 她们变得像动物一样
Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals.

我父亲不得不用绳子把她们捆住拖到树林里去
My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.

他在树林里对她们做什么了? 
What did he do with them in the woods?

你得离那个女孩远点
You need to stay away from that girl.

为什么?  她是个野人
Why? She's a wildling.

她人很好 我教她怎么读书
She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.

她是个野人 你的父亲打败了他们的人
She's a wildling. Your father defeated her people.

他以叛国罪处死了他们的国王
He executed their king for treason.

他们可以对付你 以此来报复你父亲
They could strike at him by striking at you.

吉莉不会那样做的
Gilly wouldn't do that.

你不知人心难测
You have no idea what people will do.

读了这么多书 你还是什么都不懂
All your books and you still don't know.

我下令把曼斯雷德烧死
I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.

你却阻挠我的命令
You prevented that order from being carried out.

你同情曼斯·雷德
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

国王的命令就是法律
The King's word is law.

也许你应该问问戴佛斯爵士我对犯法者有多少同情
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

如果显得太仁慈 人民就不再惧怕你了
Show too much kindness, people won't fear you.

如果他们不惧怕你 他们就不会跟随你
If they don't fear you, they don't follow you.

恕我直言 陛下 自由民永远不会跟随你 不管你做什么
With respect, Your Grace, the Free Folk will never follow you no matter what you do.

你把他们的国王活活烧死了
You're the man who burned their king alive.

不可能 只有自由民才能领导自由民
No. Only one of their own.

你认识这个可怜的女孩吗? 
Do you know this wretched girl?

莱安娜. 莫尔蒙 莫尔蒙总司令的侄女
Lyanna Mormont. Lord Commander's niece.

我让她的家族臣服于我 这就是她的回复
I asked her to commit her house to my court. That's her response.

除了北境之王史塔克 熊岛不知道还有别的君王
Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.

抱歉 陛下
I apologize, Your Grace.

北境人有点像自由民
Northerners commit a bit like the Free Folk.

我哥哥劳勃经常大声抱怨 要控制他们有多难
My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them.

即使有你父亲的帮助也是如此
Even with your father's help.

今晚 守夜人会选出新任总司令
Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander.

戴佛斯·席渥斯
'洋葱骑士' 史坦尼斯的首相

艾里沙·索恩爵士会赢
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

很有可能 一个友善的人
Most likely. One pleasant man.

他认为你是叛徒
He thinks you're a traitor.

如果索恩当了总司令 你在长城的日子会好过吗? 我想不会
What's your life gonna be like here at the Wall, with Thorne in command? Unpleasant, I expect.

你的勇敢让他显得软弱
Your bravery made him look weak.

他会为此惩罚你的
He'll punish you for it.

而我不会惩罚勇敢的人
I don't punish men for bravery.

毫无疑问 陛下
I don't doubt that, Your Grace.

但我是守夜人
But I am a brother of the Night's Watch.

我已经以我的生命 荣耀和剑发誓为守夜人军团效命
I have pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

我不知道自己还能给您什么
I don't know what I have left to give you.

你能给我北境
You can give me the North.

即便我想给也给不了 我是个私生子
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard.

弯下膝盖 将剑放在我脚边
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

宣誓为我效忠 等站起来 你就成了琼恩·史塔克
Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

他大笔一挥就能让你成为史塔克
He'll make you a Stark with a stroke of a pen.

我打记事起就希望能这样
It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.

我曾幻想父亲去求国王
I daydreamed that my father would ask the king.

这样我就再也不是临冬城的私生子了
Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again.

不 这是你应得的 真的
No, you deserve that. You do.

我 我太为你高兴了
II couldn't be happier for you.

我要拒绝他
I'm gonna refuse him.

可是… 你可以成为临冬城公爵呀
But...  you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

我向守夜人军团发过誓
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

如果我不把自己的誓言当回事 那我算哪门子的临冬城公爵?
If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would that be?

都来啦 还以为有炖野味吃呢
Crowded, You'd think we were serving venison stew.

在我们投票选出 第九百九十八任守夜人军团总司令之前 有没有人想要为候选人说两句?
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates...  before we cast our tokens...  for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

艾里沙·索恩爵士不仅是一位骑士 而且品行高贵
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility.

在长城遭遇攻击时 他是代理司令 领导我们击退了野人
He was Acting Commander when the Wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings.

他身经百战 大半辈子都是守夜人和长城的守护者
He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life.

他是唯一真正的选择 没错
He's the only true choice. Yes.

丹尼斯·梅利斯特爵士还是个孩子时就加入了守夜人军团 他效力的时间比任何游骑兵都要长
Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other Ranger.

没错  足有十个冬天
That's right. Through ten winters he served.

作为影子塔的指挥官 他一直将野人挡在门外
As Commander of the Shadow Tower...  he kept the wildlings away.

没人能比他做得更出色
We could do no better.

如果没有其他人了… 我们就开始投票
If there's no one else...  we will begin the voting.

三角形的代表艾里沙·索恩爵士
The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne.

方形的代表丹尼斯·梅利斯特爵士
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

山姆威尔·塔利 说吧
Samwell Tarly, go on.

又一个野人的情人 就像他的朋友琼恩·雪诺一样
Another wildling lover, just like his friend, Jon Snow.

杀手 你的情人怎么样了?
How's your lady love, Slayer?

史林特爵士和她熟
Ser Slynt knows her quite well.

长城一战他们一起躲在储藏室里
They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.

女野人 婴儿 还有杰诺斯大人
A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos.

大战结束后我在那里找到了他
I found him there after the battle was over.

躲在他自己的尿液积成的水坑里
In a puddle of his own making.

当杰诺斯大人和女人孩子躲在一起时
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children

琼恩·雪诺在领导战斗
Jon Snow was leading.

没错 艾里沙爵士作战勇猛 但他受伤后 是琼恩拯救了我们
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true, but when he was wounded, it was Jon who saved us.

他指挥了长城的防御 他杀死了瑟恩人马格拿 还北上与曼斯·雷德谈判
He took charge of the Wall's defense, he killed the Magnar of the Thenns, he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.

明知自己很可能有去无回
Knowing it would almost certainly mean his own death.

在那之前 他还领导了为莫尔蒙总司令复仇的行动
Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont.

莫尔蒙点名他为侍从
Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.

他看到了琼恩的闪光点
He saw something in Jon.

现在我们也都看到了
And now we've all seen it too.

他也许还年轻 但当最黑暗的长夜到来时 他是我们可以信赖的指挥官
He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.

同意
Can't argue with any of that.

但是琼恩·雪诺想领导谁?
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

大家都知道他爱过一个野人女孩
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl.

他和曼斯·雷德谈过很多次
He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

如果史坦尼斯的军队没有及时赶到 这两个老朋友在那个帐篷里会发生什么?
What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

我们都看到他帮塞外之王在痛苦中解脱
We all saw him put the KingBeyondtheWall out of his misery.

你们想选一个终身与野人作战的人 还是一个向他们示爱的人?
Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them?

学士 好像不相上下
Appears to be a tie, maester.

你拿的什么?
What have you got there?

我说… . 转身走吧!
I said... Turn around and go!

转身… 走! 原来是一把漂亮的小剑
Turn around...  and go! That's a nice little sword.

这把剑值一百只鸽子吧
Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.

对死人来说什么都不值
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

他们为什么害怕你?
Why were they scared of you?

你说这里没有贾昆·赫加尔
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

某人不是贾昆·赫加尔
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

女孩也必须成为无名之辈
And that is who a girl must become.

她应该在大金字塔里砍下叛徒的头 一劳永逸
She should have cut the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.

我一直劝她这么处置你
That's what I keep telling her to do to you.

弥莎!  陛下 今晚我会在您的门外站岗
Mhysa!  l'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.

我们都在
We all guard tonight.

凡人皆有一死 凡人皆需侍奉
Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.

我扫了好几天的地了
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

很好 我不是来这扫地的
Good. I didn't come here to sweep floors.

你说过要收我为徒
You said that I could be your apprentice.

你说要教我当一个无面者
You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.

某人教女孩
A man teaches a girl.

凡人皆需侍奉 凡人皆需侍奉
Valar dohaeris. All men must serve.

无面者尤甚
Faceless men, most of all.

女孩想侍奉的是自己
A girl wants to serve herself.

而我们侍奉的是千面之神 若要侍奉得当
Here we serve the ManyFaced God, to serve well.

女孩必须成为无名之辈 哪个是千面之神? 
A girl must become noone. Which one is the ManyFaced God?

我见到了陌客 见到了淹神
I see the Stranger, I see the Drowned God,

还见到了鱼梁木的脸 这里只有一个神
I see the Weirwood Face. There is only one god.

女孩知道他的名字
A girl knows his name.

但无人知晓他的恩赐
And no man know his gift.

他们要带他去哪? 
Where are they taking him?

我属于他 他属于我 我属于她 她属于我
I'm his, and he's mine. I'm hers, and she's mine.

从今开始 至死方休 从今开始 至死方休
From this day until the end of my days. From this day until the end of my days.

我没弄疼你吧?  没 你真棒
Did I hurt you? No. You were lovely.

一切发生都得好快 是啊
It all happened so fast. Yes.

我怕弄疼你了 因为听起来…
I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded like...

没有 没有 没有 你真可爱
No, no, no...  you're very sweet.

简直是世上最可爱的国王了
The sweetest king who ever lived.

要是一直能这样就好了 我愿把余生都用来做这个
This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.

那该多有意思? 
Wouldn't that be glorious?

不如先歇会? 
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

喘口气 不用急 对吧
Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?

要不要叫人拿点蛋糕或石榴汁? 
Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice...?

有你就够了
I just want you all to myself.

我想更了解你 想知道一切有关托曼一世国王的事情
I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.

托曼国王… 听起来还是不习惯
King Tommen... it still sounds strange to me.

你习惯别人叫你玛格丽王后么? 
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

不习惯 夫君 夫人
So strange. Husband. Wife.

有时候感觉怪怪的
Sometimes it feels odd.

我成了国王 娶了世上最美的姑娘 而这都是因为我哥哥死了
I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, and it's all because my brother died.

但你知道 这不是你的错 对吧
But it's no your fault, you know that, don't you?

你不需要内疚
You mustn't feel guilty.

我不觉得内疚 这就是我说的奇怪的地方
I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.

我爱死了 我也是
I love to sail. I do, too.

我觉得以后的日子会很幸福 你和我的日子
I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.

住在高高的塔楼里 直入云霄
Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds.

当然我奶奶已经急着想回家了
Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home.

因为君临可不是谁都能呆的
The capital is not for everyone, I suppose.

你母亲喜欢这里么? 
Does your mother like it here?

她让我不要相信君临的任何人
She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

有她照顾你真好
It's so wonderful to have her watching over you.

母狮领着小狮
A lioness guiding her cub.

但我是个大人了 现在是了
Well, but I'm a man now.

但你永远是她的小宝宝
But you'll always be her babyboy.

我仰慕她 对我总那么慷慨 那么善良
I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind.

而她经历了那么多可怕的事情
And the horror she's had to injure.

失去了丈夫 长子和父亲
Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father.

难怪总是把你护得紧紧的
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

绝不让你离开她的视线
She'll never let you out of her sight.

你陷入热恋中了
You're very much in love.

新婚燕尔总是很幸福的
The first days of marriage are often so blissful.

她很漂亮 对吧
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

爱笑 像个玩具娃娃 她觉得自己很聪明吧? 这我可说不准
Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot.  she thinks she's intelligent? I can't quite tell.

但这不重要 你想念凯岩城么? 
Not that it matters. Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

凯岩城没有什么值得我留恋的
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

那可是你长大的地方啊
That's where you grew up.

你以前总是说更喜欢那里的人
You always told me that you liked the people there better.

你说君临像马粪和馊奶一样臭
You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

为什么要提凯岩城?  每次您说起它的样子…
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? The way that you talked about it...

让我以为你想念着它
I always thought that you missed it.

那里… 是你真正的家 现在 这里才是我真正的家
That you... That it was your real home. This is my real home now.

因为我的家人都在这里
Where my family lives.

妈妈 我希望你快乐
I want you to be happy, mother.

乖孩子 我知道 但你在凯岩城不会更开心么? 
I know you do, my sweet boy. But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?

我说 '亲爱的 四次就够了 你是想创造纪录么? '
I said, 'Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?'

结果他说'什么? 这种事情还有纪录? 我们一定能打破它'
And he said, 'Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.'

你看起来真美
Well don't you look lovely.

新婚让你容光焕发
Marriage agrees with you.

吃点或喝点什么?
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

要是有酒给您就好了 不过我们一般不这么早喝酒
I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.

不 不用了 我还有事
No, no, I...I can't stay.

我只想问问 还有没有什么能帮得上忙
I just wanted to let you know if...  there is ever anything I can do for you.

托曼看起来很喜欢他的新王后
Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.

我全心全意地爱慕着他
I absolutely adore him.

您养育了一个英勇的少年郎
You raised a gallant young man.

我永远都会感谢您 很好
I'm forever grateful. Good.

你开心 我就放心了
I'm glad to hear you're happy.

真的 我喜不自禁
Ecstatic. I really am.

说实话 还有点力不从心 谁叫他又是雄狮 又是雄鹿呢
Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag.

那就拜托你了
I'll leave you to it then.

噢 抱歉 我至今都没上朝堂 我有些疑惑
Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused.

现在应该怎么称呼您? 
What's the proper way to address you now?

国王之母 还是王太后? 
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

无须多礼
There's no need for such formalities.

国王精力如此旺盛 恐怕要不了多久 国王之母就要当奶奶了
In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.

令人期待
That'll be a lovely day.

想想到时候的庆典
Imagine the celebrations.

他们没日没夜地敲着钟
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

我们不能光靠恐惧统治北境
We can't hold the North with terror alone.

要是随便哪个小领主都敢欺负我们 你根本就保不住北境
You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.

我让你去收税 不是去收尸
I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.

赛文伯爵不肯交税
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

他说北境守护永远是史塔克 如果他向叛徒臣服 那可是要下地狱的
He said the Warden of the North will always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.

你让他别无选择
You left him no choice

我活剥了他的皮 还有他妻子的 兄弟的
I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother.

让他儿子在旁边看着
I made his son watch.

下一任赛文伯爵交了税
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

我有重要的事情和你说
I have something important to tell you.

别吃了 好好听
Stop eating and listen.

我们人手太少 要是其他家族奋起反抗 我们根本无法守住北境
We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us.

你明白么? 
Do you understand that?

我们与兰尼斯特有约在先…
Our pact with the Lannisters...

我和泰温・兰尼斯特有约在先
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

但是泰温・兰尼斯特死了
Tywin Lannister is dead.

剩下的兰尼斯特族人远在千里之外
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.

在七国历史上 他们从不出兵北境
They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north.

只有傻瓜才信他们会出手相助
If you think they will for us, you're a fool.

我们家族之所以强大 全靠与其他家族结盟 然后通过结盟变得更加强大
We become a great House by entering in alliances with other Houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power.

而缔结盟约的最佳方法 可不是去剥人家的皮 是联姻
Now the best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off, the best way is marriage.

如今 你已被王室赐予了波顿这个姓氏 是时候娶个门当户对的新娘了
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride.

我找到一个完美的姑娘 恰好能助我们掌控北境
I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.

那是卡林湾 正是
That's Moat Cailin. Yes.

破破烂烂的 对吧
A bit shabby, isn't it?

你来过这儿
You've been here before.

去君临时来过 同行的有我父亲 艾莉亚 还有…
On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...

您要带我去哪儿?  回家
Where are you taking me? Home.

波顿家族占领了临冬城
The Boltons have Winterfell.

联姻的人… 并不是您? 
The marriage proposal...It wasn't for you?

卢斯・波顿杀了我哥哥 他背叛了我的家族!
Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!

他是兰尼斯特的人
He serves the Lannisters.

临冬城是你的家 不再是了
Winterfell is your home. Not anymore.

永远都是 你永远都是史塔克家族的一员
Always. You're a Stark.

染头发也变不了这个事实 你是珊莎・史塔克
Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark.

奈德・史塔克与凯特琳・史塔克存活于世上最年长的血脉
The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

你的根基在北境
Your place is in the North.

我不会嫁给他 您不能逼我
I can't marry him. You can't make me.

他是叛徒 是杀人犯
He's a traitor. A murderer.

我不是让你嫁给卢斯・波顿
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

不是的 你要嫁的 是他的长子与继承人 拉姆斯
No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay.

终有一天 他会成为北境守护以及…  不!
One day he'll be Warden of the North and... No!

珊莎…  不 您不能逼我
Sansa... No, you can't make me.

我宁可绝食 死也不去那里
I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.

我不会逼你做任何事情
I won't force you to do anything.

你不知道现在我有多在乎你么? 
Don't you know by now how much I care for you?

你要不想去 我们立马回头 但听我说
Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me.

你一辈子都在逃避
You've been running all your life.

家人惨遭厄运 而你只是哭泣
Terrible things happened to your family and you weep.

躲起来偷偷地为他们哀悼
You sit alone in a dark room, mourning their fates.

从你父亲被处决那天开始 你对家族的悲剧束手无策
You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.

不要再做旁观者了 听到了吗?  不要再逃避
Stop being a bystander, you hear me? Stop running.

这个世界没有公义可言
There's no justice in the world.

除非我们亲手实现它
Not unless we make it.

你爱你的家人
You loved your family.

我们怎么通过卡林湾? 
How do we get through there?

那会多绕一段远路
It sets miles out of the way.

我们会跟丢的 没关系
We'll lose sight of them. Doesn't matter.

我知道他们要去哪
I know where they're going.

以你的年纪做侍从是不是有点大了? 
Don't you get a bit old for a squire?

你怎么会给小恶魔做侍从的? 
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

他讨厌那个绰号
He hates that nickname.

呃 反正他人又不在 也没法抱怨
Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?

五王之战期间我是罗里默爵士的侍从
I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings.

一天晚上 他喝多了酒
One night, he had a bit too much to drink.

觉得有点饿 就借了块火腿
And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

借的?  他不是小偷
He borrowed it? He wasn't a thief.

他又醉又饿 根本没想那么多
He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking.

他给了我半块火腿
He gave me half the ham.

第二天早上 守卫发现他躺在货车底下 醉的不省人事 手里还攥着吃剩的骨头
Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand.

当天下午 他就被吊死了
They hanged the man after noon.

他们也为我准备了绞索 不过泰温公爵听说我姓派恩 就赦免了我 把我送到君临给他儿子做侍从
They tied the noose for me too, but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne, so he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.

对你们两个都是惩罚 也不能这么说
For both of you. It didn't seem that way.

提利昂大人一直对我非常好
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

我想你服侍过的大人们都对你很好
I guess all of your lords were very kind to you.

让你来服侍我这么个暴脾气 真是对不住
Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.

我不这么觉得 您是我见过最好的战士
I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

我很骄傲能成为您的侍从
I'm proud to be your squire.

抱歉我一直对你这么苛刻
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

您对我不严厉的话 我什么东西也学不到
If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.

你想成为骑士吗 波德? 
You want to be a knight, Pod?

明天开始 我们每天练习两次剑法 早晨出发之前和晚上宿营之后各一次
Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening.

我还会教你骑马的技巧
And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.

我无法封你为骑士 但我可以教你如何战斗
I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.

我想这更重要一些
I suppose that's more important.

您虽然不是骑士 但您曾是蓝礼・拜拉席恩的御林铁卫 是吗? 
You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

提利昂大人说他是个好人
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

您怎么会效忠蓝礼的? 
But how did you end up serving Renly?

我还是小姑娘的时候 我父亲举办了一场舞会
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

我是他的独女 他希望能为我找一门好亲事
I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me.

他邀请了几十位年轻的贵族来塔斯
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

我不想参加 但他把我硬拉到舞厅
I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom.

舞会棒极了
And it was wonderful.

那些男孩们好像都忘记了我是多么笨拙 多么蠢大
None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was.

他们互相挑衅 甚至要决斗 争着与我跳舞
The shaft each other and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance.

一个个悄悄对我说 他们多么想跟我结婚 把我带回他们的城堡
Whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles.

我和父亲相视而笑
My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.

我从未如此幸福
I'd never been so happy.

直到我看到几个男孩在窃笑
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

接着他们全都大笑起来 再也玩不下去这场游戏
And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer.

其实他们只是在戏弄我
They were toying with me.

他们叫我'美人'布蕾妮 天大的讽刺
Brienne the Beauty, they called me. Great joke.

我才意识到自己是世界上最丑的女孩
And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.

是个高大蠢笨的野兽
A great lumbering beast.

我想逃跑 但是蓝礼・拜拉席恩抱住我
I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

别让他们看见你的眼泪 他对我说
Don't let them see your tears, he told me.

这些下流坯 这些下流坯不值得你流眼泪
The nasty little shits, nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.

他与我共舞 其他男孩们哑口无言
He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.

毕竟他是国王的弟弟
And he was the king's brother after all.

提利昂大人说他是…
Lord Tyrion said he was...

是的 波德 他喜欢男人 我不是傻瓜
Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot.

他并不爱我 也不想要我 他和我跳舞 因为他很善良 不想看到我伤心
He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt.

他拯救了我 使我不至于成为一个笑话
He saved me from being a joke.

从那天开始 直到他生命的终点
From that day until his last day.

我却不能挽救他性命
And I couldn't save him in return.

没有什么比不能保护你爱的人更让人悔恨
Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.

终有一天 我会为蓝礼国王报仇
One day, I will avenge King Renly.

但是您说一个影子杀死了他
But you said a shadow murdered him.

您怎能和影子战斗
How do you fight a shadow?

一个有着史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩面孔的影子
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

我知道那是史坦尼斯
I know it was Stannis.

我始终记在心里
I know it in my heart.

史坦尼斯是个人 不是影子
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

只要是人 就能被杀死
And a man...  can be killed.

总司令大人 陛下
Lord Commander. Your Grace.

我要和你单独谈谈
I'd like to speak alone.

奥力是我的事务官 正如我曾是莫尔蒙总司令的事务官
Ollie is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

我希望他能参加我们的会谈 以便向经验丰富的人学习
I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience.

有朝一日 他或许会成为总司令
One day, he might command.

好吧 你考虑过我的提议了吗? 
Very well. Have you considered my offer?

我很感激您的提议 深感荣幸
And I thank you for it. You do me great honor.

我这辈子都梦想成为琼恩・史塔克
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

答应我 就能如你所愿
Say the word and you will be.

但我不得不拒绝您
But I have to refuse you.

我是守夜人的总司令
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

我是在给你提供为家族复仇的机会
I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family.

夺回你从小长大的城堡
Take back the castle where you grew up.

我也希望能跟随您一起战斗
I wish I could fight beside you.

但我在神木林立下了神圣的誓言
But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood.

发誓将一生献给守夜人
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

你就跟你父亲一样地顽固
You're as stubborn as your father.

对我来说 没有比这更高的赞扬了
I can imagine no higher praise.

这并不是赞扬
I didn't mean it as praise.

你父亲正是死于他的荣誉感
Honor got your father killed.

如果你已经打定主意 我就不再白费唇舌
But if your minds made up,I won't try to persuade you.

我想请问陛下 您打算在黑城堡待多久
Can I ask Your Grace how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?

你已经厌烦我们了? 
Are you bored of us already?

您从曼斯? 雷德的手下拯救了我们
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.

我们永远不会忘记这一点
We will never forget that.

但这是关乎生存的问题
But it's a question of survival.

守夜人不可能一直为您的部队和野人俘虏提供食物
Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

嗯 凛冬将至
Mm, winter is coming.

两周之内我的军队就会向临冬城进发
We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.

以免被大雪困在这
Before the snows trap us here.

他们宁愿被烧死也不愿为我作战 随他们吧
They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it.

他们的命运由你决定
I leave their fate to you.

你可以处死他们 这是最保险的做法
You could execute them, that's the safest course.

或者你可以试试那个托蒙德 是不是比曼斯更容易妥协
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was.

我想守夜人的兄弟们更想处死野人
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.

大部分是的
Most of the brothers, yes.

自由民在这里不受欢迎
There's little love for the free folk here.

你是守夜人总司令
You're Lord Commander.

你在黑城堡树敌不少
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

有没有想过把艾里沙・索恩派到别处去
Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

比如让他去东海望做司令官
Give him command of EastwachbytheSea.

我听说最好把敌人留在你眼皮底下
I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.

这么说的人肯定没有多少敌人
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
'洋葱骑士' 史坦尼斯的首相

他很看重你
He sees something in you.

或许他没有表达出来 但这是事实 他信任你
Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.

很抱歉让他失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

国王的心思难以琢磨
The king is a complicated man.

但他确实希望给七国带来公正
But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.

他得先统治七国才行
As long as he's ruling them.

他是唯一合法的国王
He's the one true king.

他的血统继承权是名正言顺的
He has the blood right to that throne.

我曾发誓远离七国的政治斗争
I sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

守夜人誓言是怎么说的来着? 
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

我想你刚来这儿就背过吧
I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.

长夜将至, 我从今开始守望…
Night gathers and now my watch begins...

不是这段 结尾那段
Not that bit, the bit at the end.

我是黑暗中的利剑 长城中的守卫 守护王国的坚盾
I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men.

我将生命…  好了 够了
I pledge my life... Okay, that's enough.

守护王国的坚盾
Shield that guards the realm of men.

这才是你发誓要做到的
That's what you swore to be.

我不懂太多的大道理 但我认为守护王国最好的方法 可不是坐在世界尽头冰冷的城堡里
Now I'm not a learned man, the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world.

或许应该是踩着脏兮兮的靴子 弄得浑身泥泞 也要做你该做的事
It just might mean waiting in the mud,getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.

那你觉得什么才是该做的事
And what needs to be done?

只要波顿统治北境 北境就会受苦
As long as the Boltons rule the North, the North will suffer.

一己之见而已
Just one man's opinion.

这硬币并非你亲手挣来 你拿着它进门 却不尊重它的价值
You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect.

你撒谎 一个可悲的谎言
A lie, a sad little lie.

你是谁? 我说过 我是无...
Who are you? I told you, I'm no...

你会知道的
You're about to find out.

那女孩还没准备好
That girl is not ready.

准备好做你要求的任何事 只要能成为无面者
For whatever you want to be a Faceless Man.

它属于艾莉亚・史塔克
It belongs to Arya Stark.

艾莉亚・史塔克的剑 艾莉亚・史塔克的衣服
Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes,

艾莉亚・史塔克偷来的银币
Arya Stark's stolen silver.

某人想知道 怎么无名之辈的身边 都是艾莉亚・史塔克的东西?
A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

洗干净他们之后要做什么?
What do we do with them after you wash them?

请允许我介绍我的儿子 拉姆斯・波顿
May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?

很荣幸见到您 小姐
It's an honor to meet you, my lady

我给您拿热水来
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.

您一定想洗洗了
You must want to wash.

欢迎回家 史塔克小姐
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

他为不能到场而道歉
He apologizes for not being here.

山姆威尔・塔利
'杀手' 守夜人事务官

他不太舒服
He's not feeling well.

好好照顾他
Take good care of him.

那我喝了吧
I will drink it then.

你们都很清楚 早该挖个新茅厕了
As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.

首席工匠亚威克和我已经决定委任 一位茅厕队长来监督这项重要任务
First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.

一头黄毛的人好像挺适合这活儿
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

你比黑城堡的其他游骑兵都更有经验
You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.

野人攻击长城时 你多次证明了自己的英勇
You proved your valour many times over by defending the Wall from the wildling attack.

我任命你为首席游骑兵
I name you First Ranger.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

我任命你为灰卫堡指挥官
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

是的 堡垒的状况很糟糕
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.

尽你所能将其重建
Restore it as best you can.

首席工匠亚威克可以分出...
First Builder Yarwyck can spare...

你小子还在襁褓里拉屎拉尿的时候 我就执掌整个君临的防务了
I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.

你误会我了 大人
You mistake me, my Lord.

这是命令 并非提议
That was a command, not an offer.

你赶紧收拾好盔甲和武器 跟大家告别 动身去灰卫堡
Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.

我才不会服服帖帖地去被冻死呢
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

把那废墟留给个瞎了眼投票选你的傻瓜吧
Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.

你听清楚没 小鬼?
Did you hear me, boy?

你拒绝执行我的命令?
You refusing to obey my order?

你可以拿你的命令去干你那野种的屁股
You can stick your order up your bastard arse.

把杰诺斯大人拖出去
Take Lord Janos outside.

奥利 把我的剑拿来
Ollie, bring me my sword.

放开我!
Get your hands off me!

如果这小鬼自以为能吓唬我
If the boy thinks he can frighten me

那他就大错特错了
He's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.

我有朋友 我在朝中有人!
I have friends, important friends in the capital!

大人 你要还有什么遗言 就快说吧
If you have any last words, my Lord...  now is the time.

我错了 您是总司令大人!
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander!

我们都侍奉您 我道歉 不光为这次 也为我以前的做过的事 说过的话道歉
We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said.

求您了 大人 发发慈悲 发发慈悲吧!
My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy!

我一直都在害怕
I've always been afraid.

你把我们侍奉得很好 我的孩子
You have served us well, my son.

今天您要膜拜七神中的哪一位?
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

少女... 少女在哪儿?
The Maiden...where is the Maiden?

您要知道 两人要另外加钱 晓得了晓得了
Two is extra, you realize... Yes, yes.

这是培提尔・贝里席大人的地盘 你们不能...
This establishment belongs to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...

你亵渎了我们的信仰
You have profaned our Faith.

我们父辈和先人的信仰
The Faith of our fathers and forefathers.

我是总主教…
I am the High Septon of the...

你将为此受罚
And you shall be punished.

罪人! 罪人! 罪人!
Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

罪人! 真可耻! 罪人!
Sinner! Shame on you! Sinner!

陛下 大学士 提利尔大人 还有呃…
Your Grace, Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, Uh...

作为七神信仰的总主教
As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven

我为诸神的意志代言 我是他们在这世上最重要的仆人
I give voice to the will of the Gods and I am their foremost servant in this world.

对我的侮辱就是对诸神的侮辱
An insult to me is an insult to the Gods.

对我个人的侵犯 就是对我们宗教的侵犯
An assault on my person is an assault on our very religion.

我被那些自称为麻雀的狂热教徒侵犯
By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows.

他们羞辱我 他们打我 他们让我赤身裸体站在鹅卵石上流血
They humiliated me they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones.

我能活下来真是命大
I am lucky to be alive.

我听说这事是在小指头的妓院里发生的
I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.

总主教 这可是件让人不齿的事
High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.

无论贵贱之人我都会照看
I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.

即使妓女也会得到圣母的怜悯
Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.

所以你是在关照这些虔诚妓女的需要咯?
So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

一个人的私事就应保持私密
A man's private affairs ought to stay private.

你想要我们做什么 总主教?
What do you want from us, High Septon?

我请求你们保护我们的教会 逮捕这些罪犯 把他们扔进黑牢
I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throw them in the black cells.

我请求你们处决他们的首领 这个所谓的大麻雀
I ask that you execute their leader, this socalled High Sparrow.

他对我们所尊重的一切构成了威胁
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.

如果他不受惩罚…  我在哪儿能找到这个人?
If he goes unpunished... And where do I find this man?

陛下 我认为这不是个好主意
I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.

胡说 马林爵士 这些都是非常虔诚的人
Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people.

我在哪儿能找到大麻雀?
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

谢谢您的汤
Thank you for the soup.

有个年轻人说我能在这里找到大麻雀 他在哪儿?
The young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?

听上去很荒谬 不是吗?
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

就像小鸭大人 或者乌龟国王一样荒谬
Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle.

我们往往没法摆脱敌人给我们取的绰号
We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us.

我们在七神眼中都是平等的 这个观念 让某些人难以接受 于是他们贬低我
The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of the Seven doesn't sit well with some so they belittle me.

七神保佑你 七神保佑你 亲爱的
Seven blessings to you. Seven blessings to you, my dear.

这只是个称呼 很容易接受
It's only a name, quite an easy burden to bear.

比她的遭遇要容易承受
Far easier than hers.

因为我把鞋送给更需要的人了
Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.

这样我们就不会忘记自己究竟是谁
It stops us from forgetting what we really are.

你是因为这个来君临的吗?
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

每一个人? 光提醒自己就够难的了
Everyone? I hardened the job reminding myself.

我告诉他们 没有人是与众不同的
Well, I tell them no one's special.

而正因为我说了这话 他们认定我与众不同
They think I'm special for telling them so.

也许他们是对的
Perhaps they're right.

相信这一点让人心安 不是吗?
It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it?

诸神派你来考验我?
The Gods sent you here to tempt me?

我猜 你来这里就是为了抓我的
I'd assumed you'd only come here to arrest me.

因为总主教遭遇的意外
For that incident with the High Septon.

如此对待七神在凡间指定的代言人 有点过分了 您说是不是? 
An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

切开它并不好受
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

不过 他们原本可以在动刀子的时候更小心一些的
Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.

总主教今天找我谈过了
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

他并不希望我逮捕你 而是希望我处决你
He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.

我不敢妄图揣测圣意
I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.

我对这件事的看法与你一致
My thoughts on the matter align with your own.

总主教的行为堕落 态度可憎
The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude.

让这样的人留在圣堂里 会从内部侵蚀人们的信仰
Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside.

所以现在他搬到红堡的地牢去了
So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead.

信仰与王权是支撑着整个世界的两根支柱
The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.

如果其中一根倒塌了 另一根也难以幸免
If one collapses, so does the other.

我们必须尽一切努力 来保护对方才行
We must do everything necessary to protect one another.

派只信鸦去把这封信送给小指头 不管他是在鹰巢城还是其他什么地方
Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie or wherever he's slithering about.

你的工作开展得如何?  非常顺利
How's your work coming along? Very well.

取得了什么进展吗?  比我预期的进展更多
You've made progress? More than I've expected.

虽然还有着很长的路要走
Still a way to go, but...

很好 那你接着干吧
Very good. I'll leave you to it then.

确保小指头明白'立即'这个词是什么意思
Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word 'immediate'.

她真是可爱
She really is lovely.

希望我能让她开心
I hope I can make her happy.

一路走来 我可是越发喜欢珊莎小姐了
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.

我很少听说关于你的事情
I've heard very little about you.

对于贵族老爷们来说 这可不太寻常
Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.

我不久前才刚刚成为贵族
I haven't been a lord very long.

过去我是个私生子 而现在不是了
I was a bastard. And you're not anymore.

让我和贝里席大人单独谈一谈
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

好的 父亲 谢谢您 贝里席大人
Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish.

我永远感激您
I'm forever in your debt.

我向您确保珊莎还是个处女
I assure you she's still a virgin.

提利昂和她没有圆房 根据七国的法律 她并未成婚
Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife.

如果您不信的话可以检查她
Inspect her, if you must.

这个事情妓院老板操心就好了
I leave that to the brothel keeper.

我要的是她的姓氏 而不是她的贞操
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

我给您带来了允诺的一切
I have delivered everything I've promised.

您还得负责善后
And you prepared for the consequences.

兰尼斯特家族要是得知我把珊莎许给拉姆斯可不会善罢甘休
When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.

兰尼斯特的名头已经不复以往
The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.

过去是他凭借一己之力维持着家族的强盛
He kept his house in power through sheer will.

詹姆只有一只手 又缺乏盟友
Jaime has one hand and no allies,

托曼不过是个温和的小男孩 身为国王根本不足为惧
Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

王后定会怒不可遏
The Queen will be enraged.

玛格丽王后很喜欢珊莎
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

瑟曦现在是王太后了 随着时间流逝 她会越来越边缘化
Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.

可她如今依然有盟友 这些盟友身居要职 她尽可以找他们帮忙
And yet she still has friends.  men in important places, whom she can ask for favours.

这封信是瑟曦寄给您的
A message for you, from Cersei Lannister.

破晓前不久 一个骑手从鹰巢城送来
A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn.

显然 她以为您还在谷地
Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.

您说这封信是给我的
A message for me, you say.

可它的封蜡却被拆开了
Strange that the seal is broken.

相信您能理解 贝里席大人
I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish.

您在夜里收到了来自王太后的消息 这让我不得不对我们新成立的联盟心怀疑虑
If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance.

兰尼斯特让您跻身维斯特洛最具权势的领主之列
Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros.

然而 您现在却身在北境 置他们于不利
Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them.

何必赌上如今的地位来冒险呢? 
Why gamble with your position?

实现野心的每一步都是一次赌博
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

您赌了一把 将匕首插进了罗柏・史塔克的心脏
You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart.

看起来收获颇丰啊
It appears that your gamble paid off.

现在您是北境守护了
You're Warden of the North.

我原本有泰温・兰尼斯特的支持
I had Tywin Lannister backing.

现在谁来做我的后援 您吗? 
Who supports me now? You?

上一次谷地与北境的领主联手的时候 他们推翻了有史以来最伟大的王朝
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.

我得跟您借只鸟儿
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

瑟曦等着我回复呢
Cersei will expect a reply.

我也得看看您的回复
I'd like to read the reply.

我要下车
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

瓦兰提斯可是一座大城市
Volantis is a large city.

我要下车
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

您在这里被发现的几率 可比其他地方高上一百倍
The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundred fold.

我要下车
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

我不知道还能怎样变着法子拒绝您了
I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.

如果脑子被憋坏了 我对丹妮莉丝・坦格利安就一点用也没有了
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind.

除了你的脸外 我已经想不起来别人的脸是什么样子了
I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.

我的脸可是完美无瑕呢
It's a perfectly good face.

您要被人认出来 坏的就不光是…
If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than...

听着 我们已经离维斯特洛几千里远了
Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros.

只不过是又一个醉醺醺的侏儒而已
One more drunk dwarf.

我们得走了 快来
We have to go now. Come on.

瓦兰提斯的奴隶主非常有条理
The Volantene masters are very organized.

他们在掏粪工脸上烙上苍蝇
Flies for dung shovelers.

在工匠脸上烙上锤子
Hammers for builders.

我们走吧
We should keep moving.

君临唯一的红袍祭司就是密尔的索罗斯
The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.

这个长得好看多了
This one's much better looking.

但愿祈祷能阻止灰鳞病的传染
Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer.

也许跳舞驱邪能更管用呢
You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.

我们要去见的可是救世主呢
We're going to meet the Saviour.

你早该告诉我的
You should have told me.

谁不想见见救世主呢? 
Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?

咱们找家妓院去
Let's find a brothel.

吹侏儒的老二还能让你洪福齐天呢
It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

瞧见没 我们混进来了
See? We blend right in.

就像两个普通的旅行者 欲火焚身
Just two more travellers, mad with lust.

龙之母
The Mother of Dragons.

看起来支持坦格利安家族的可不止你一个
It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 被放逐的骑士

一个既能鼓舞祭司又能启发妓女的人可不容小觑
Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.

你为什么值这么多钱? 
What makes you worth so much?

我要去和长了头发的人聊聊天
I need to speak to someone with hair.

你没有酒 你也没有钱
You've got no drink. You've got no money.

我看起来像没有钱的人吗? 
Do I look like a man without money?

直到不久以前 我还是世界上最有钱的人之一
Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world.

但如果你能博得美人一笑 谁还需要钱呢? 
But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh?

我向来可是有债必还 人们都知道
I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.

他们都想操女王
They all want to fuck a queen.

那是因为他们从来没见过女王 好像你见过一样
Because they never met a queen. You're just saying that.

你能看出来谁在撒谎
You know how to spot a liar.

如果让我在这儿所有的女孩里挑一个
If I could pick any girl here,

因为你有自己的主意
Because you have a skeptical mind.

那好吧 但我警告你 你得先把自己洗干净
Alright, then. I'm warning you. You're gonna have to wash you first.

抱 抱歉 我不能
I'm...I'm sorry, I can't.

我很乐意 但我真的不能
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

说真的 我自己比谁都震惊
Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am.

不然我闲的时候干什么啊? 
What will I do in my spare time?

我去撒泡尿 也许是个好的开始
Go for a...piss like a start

不用担心 我只是在…  哦
No need to worry, I was just... Oh...

我认错人了
I thought you were someone else.

我敢肯定屋里的女孩们会乐意效劳的
I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.

你搞错了吧 跟我说说你打算干什么 然后…
You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and...

我打算带你去觐见陛下
I'm taking you to the Queen.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
'大熊' 被放逐的骑士

詹姆·兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

我们为什么要坐商船? 
Why are we on a merchant ship?

也不挂兰尼斯特的帆? 
Why no Lannister sails?

这艘船驶往旧镇
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

但我们会在阳戟城附近提早下船
We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear.

趁夜色自己划进多恩海岸
Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.

你去过多恩吗? 
You ever been to Dorne?

多恩民风彪悍 天天只想着打和操 操和打 能回去你应该很开心啊
The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck, fuck and fight. You should be happy to go back.

没什么比好好打一架更能激起操的兴致
There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking.

也没什么比操意乱情迷的多恩妞 更能让人振奋精神 再打一架
And there's nothing like a fuckmad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight.

二者相辅相成
It's how the two work together.

我敢肯定我们会打上不少架
And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure.

百分之百肯定 但我不觉得咱们会有时间在这儿逗留
Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest.

绑了他们的公主就得开溜了
Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

我们不是绑架他们的公主
We are not kidnapping their princess.

是救我的外甥女 带她回家
We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,

我干这行很久了
I've been doing this sort of thing a long time.

所以把你带上啊 我明白
That's why you're here. I know.

可你为什么要来? 为什么不派 40 个人 或者干脆派一支军队? 
Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army?

你又不是两手空空 而是兵权在握
Unlike most folks, you actually got one.

因为我不想挑起战争
Because I don't want to start a war.

这还是说不通你为啥这么做
That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.

我觉得这事吧 一个就一只手 又在整个维斯特洛无人不识的人 实在是不…
If I'm putting something of a lit together, a onehanded man, who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not...

你弟弟是你放的 对不
You set your brother free, didn't you?

你姐肯定火大吧
I bet your sister didn't like that.

那么… 如果你哪天见到那个小混蛋 替我跟他问声好
Well...  if you ever see the little fucker, give him my regards.

他杀了我父亲
He murdered my father.

我要能再见着他 我先得劈了他
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

再替你跟他问声好
And then I'll give him your regards.

铁金库已向王室索还十分之一的债务
The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts.

鉴于重建王城的支出 王室这次能出多少? 
Given the expensive rebuilding of... How much can the Crown afford?

凛冬将至啊 顶多他们索要的一半吧
With winter coming, half what they ask.

也许更少 你是财政大臣
Less. You're the Master of Coin.

你有什么想法吗? 提利尔家族可以先垫上些金子 当然王室也要按时还清 不然我就得找我女儿聊聊了
How do we pay them? House Tyrell could front the gold and the...  the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.

您已经为我们做得够多了
You've already given us too much.

不 我们还是要和铁金库协商出更有利于我们的条件
No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.

那是当然 派专人去谈
Absolutely. In person.

我们必须派遣一位使节去铁金库 此人必须身居高位 让铁金库看见我们的诚意
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect.

您是财政大臣 没人比您更称职了
As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.

我很荣幸 陛下
I will be honored, Your Grace.

国王陛下对他岳父大人此行的安全深表担忧
The King has expressed concern about his fatherinlaw's safety on this voyage.

他已下令马林爵士亲自护送您前往
He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.

一位御林铁卫?
A valiant Kingsguard?

请替我表达…  一路顺风 提利尔大人
Please express... Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

那是 那是 我定会替各位向布拉佛斯的巨人问好
Of course, of course, I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.

这个小议会真是越变越小了呢
The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

您要喝杯酒么 主教大人
May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?

前任主教通常会要一杯葡萄酒的
The old High Septon would have asked the vintage.

我本该说我们的心智是供奉七神的圣殿 应当保持纯洁
I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure.

我是不喜欢酒的味道
I don't like the taste.

整个维斯特洛都听闻有教士被活活烧死
All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned.

静默姐妹惨遭奸污
Silent sisters raped.

神职人员横尸街道
Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

战争教会了人民要向刀剑俯首 而不是众神
Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.

也许众神需要自掌刀剑
Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own.

在坦格利安王朝之前 曾有教团武装代表七神执行正义
In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.

可是教团武装两百多年前就解散了
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.

如果我对我儿子 也就是国王陈述此事
If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king,

毫无疑问 他会签署法令批准您集结可靠的信众
I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you find worthy.

组成一支扞卫众生肉体和灵魂的军队
An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.

一支侍奉七神的军队
An army and service to the Gods themselves.

当然也是听命于您的军队
And to you, of course.

毕竟您是七神的代言人
As the chosen representative of the Seven.

我未尝期盼过如此荣耀
An honor I've never expected.

甚至不曾想过
Or indeed, ever wished for.

这恰是您被选中的原因
Which is why you were chosen.

您和我都深知这世界运行的规律
You and I both know how the world works.

很多时候奸邪之辈和巨富之人往往游离在法律之外
Too often the wicked or the wealthiest be on the reach of justice.

国王甚至都无法制裁这些应当受罚的人
The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.

所有罪人在七神面前都是平等的
All sinners are equal before the Gods.

倘若我告诉您在我们中间就有这么一个
What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our own midst?

被黄金和特权保护着的大罪人呢? 
Shielded by gold and privilege.

愿天父公正地审判他
May the Father judge him justly.

这是培提尔·贝里席大人的产业
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

七层地狱有专门为你们这种人准备的地方
There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.

求求你们了 我会付钱的
Please, please, I'll pay!

放开我
Get your hands off of me.

提利尔家族的洛拉斯爵士 你触犯了诸神与凡人的法律
Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.

你以为你是什么东西? 
Who do you think you are?

为什么把我哥哥关进牢房? 
Why is my brother in a cell?

你我都清楚是谁干的
We both know who did.

你跟我说她要回凯岩城
You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.

你是在说我母亲在背后谋划了这一切?
Are you saying my mother is behind this?

她嫉妒你不再是她的了
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.

逮捕我哥哥就是对我的报复
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

你和母亲不是关系融洽么? 
Aren't you and mother getting along?

哦 我亲爱的甜心国王陛下啊
Oh, my sweet, sweet King.

您到底爱不爱我呢
Do you have any affection for me at all?

想到我哥被关在污秽不堪的地牢 我就无法忍受
I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.

我去为你释放他
I'll set him free for you.

我下令即刻释放洛拉斯爵士!
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!

可是你武装了教团武装
But you armed the Faith Militant.

给了大麻雀一支军队
You gave the High Sparrow an army.

你妻子自然也就有权抱怨你
And your wife has every right to criticize.

不能任由宗教狂逮捕王后的兄长 即使他有悖人伦
Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.

这样的话 我可以告诉玛格丽您将要放了洛拉斯爵士吗
Then...  can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?

我早已说过我没有拘禁洛拉斯爵士
I told you I am not holding Ser Loras.

您是国王 我相信如果您向大麻雀求情 他一定会释放这个可怜人
You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.

主教大人正在祈祷 不许有人打扰
His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.

只要您下令 我们立刻将这反贼碎尸万段
Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.

你是说 杀了他们? 在这圣堂里?
You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?

您这是送他们去见自己热爱的七神
You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.

你这怪胎!
You're an abomination!

我们另找一条路
We'll find another way.

不用武力根本不可能救出洛拉斯爵士
There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.

您是安达尔人的国王 七大王国之主 全境守护
You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm.

您却任由一群疯子囚禁您的小舅子
And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.

我去和大麻雀谈谈 真的吗? 何时?
I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow. Are you? When?

我… 我不知道 您不知道?
II don't know. You don't know?

他刚刚在祈祷
He was praying just now.

我得去告诉祖母
I have to send word to Grandmother.

你一会儿还回来吗?
Will you come back later?

我需要和我的家人在一起 陛下
I need to be wit my family, Your Grace.

你对这个男孩寄予厚望
You think highly of this boy.

艾迪森·托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

守夜人的总司令 小酒馆里妓女的私生子
Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. A bastard by some tavern slut.

也许吧 不过奈德·史塔克不像这样的人
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

我本该为你生个男孩
I should have given you a son.

不是你的错 那是谁的错呢? 
Not your fault. Whose then?

我什么也没给您 只有软弱
I gave you nothing but weakness.

这些伤疤对光之王来说不算什么
Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.

她父亲是光之王选中的国王
Her father is the Lord's chosen King.

她父亲的血液也流淌在她的体内
And her father's blood runs through her veins.

您将进军临冬城
You march on Winterfell soon.

您曾经相信戴佛斯爵士 把我扔在脑后
Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.

我希望您不要再犯同样的错误
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

陛下 您只需要信仰
You only need faith, my King.

那么夫人 你需要什么呢?
And you, my Lady, what do you need?

山姆威尔·塔利
'杀手' 守夜人事务官

我从未听说过这些人
Never even heard of these people.

他们也从未听说过您
They haven't heard of you either.

但我们需要人手 他们有人手
But we need men and they have some.

这位梅森爵士可以提供多少人手呢?
How many men does this Lord Mayzen have to send us?

比韦伯利爵士能给的多
More than Lord Wibberley.

我也不想 但是我们需要人手和吃的
I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies.

而卢斯波顿是北境守…
And Roose Bolton is the Warden of...

他杀了我兄弟 我们早已宣誓成为长城上的守夜人
He murdered my brother. We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall.

我们不能依靠五十个兄弟守卫长城
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

而没有北境守护的帮助 我们也无法招募更多人手
And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.

和我们一起向南进军吧
Come with us when we ride south.

你对城堡的了解胜过我们所有人
None of us know the castle as well as you do.

机关隧道 城防弱点 世俗民情
Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.

临冬城曾是你的家
Winterfell was your home once.

难道你不想把这帮耗子赶出家门?
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

现在我的家是黑城堡
Castle Black is my home now.

守夜人从不参与七大王国的战争
Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

这世上只有一场战争
There's only one war.

让我告诉你将要为何而战
Let me show what you're fighting for.

你会给我看火中的幻象
You're gonna show me some vision in the fire.

我不相信幻象
But I don't trust in visions.

你能感受到我心脏的搏动吗?
Do you feel my heart beating?

你有强大的力量 你在抗拒它 这是你的错误 请拥抱它
This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.

天生男女
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

其质有别
Two parts of a greater whole.

可您却拒绝这力量
You're not joining this power.

或曰可创生 或曰可有光 或曰阴影召之即来
Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.

我不认为史坦尼斯大人喜欢这样
I don't think Stannis would like that very much.

那我们就不告诉他
Then we shouldn't tell him.

死者不需要爱人

你也经常感到无聊吗?

我知道黑城堡并不是孩子玩耍的地方
I know Castle Black is no place for a child.

我曾以为我会被扔在家里
I thought I'd be left at home.

我知道母亲不想带我来
I know mother didn't want to bring me.

她说过'我并不想带上你'
She told me 'I don't want to bring you.'

她不该这么说
She shouldn't have said that.

您因我感到羞耻吗 父亲?
Are you ashamed of me, father?

当你还是个婴儿的时候 有个多恩商人来过龙石岛
When you were an infant, the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone.

他的货物都没什么意思 除了一只木玩偶
His goods were junk except for one wooden doll.

他还用我们家族的颜色给玩偶缝衣服
He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House.

毫无疑问 他听说了你降生的消息
No doubt he'd heard of your birth.

认定新科父亲都容易上当
And assumed new fathers were easy targets.

我还记得当我将玩偶放入摇篮时 你微笑的样子
I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle.

你将玩偶贴在小脸上
You pressed it to your cheek.

当我们烧掉那玩偶的时候 已经太晚了
By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late.

他们说你会死
I was told you would die.

灰鳞将会慢慢生长
The grayscale would go slow.

等你长大到刚刚开始了解世界的年纪 就将你夺走

我告诉他们全都滚蛋

我召集了世界上所有的学士
I called in every maester on this side of the world.

医师 药剂师
Every healer, every apothecary.

他们控制住了病情 拯救了你的生命

因为你不该在世界另一边和那些可怕的石民生活
Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men.

你是拜拉席恩家族的希琳公主
You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

更是我的女儿
And you are my daughter.

我就觉得能在这儿找到你
I thought I might find you here.

我父亲从不提起她
My father never talked about her.

有时我会看到他下来 点起蜡烛
Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles.

大家都说她是个美人
They say she was beautiful.

那时我还小 住在你母亲家
I was a boy, living with your mother's family.

河安伯爵在赫伦堡举办一场盛大的比武大会
Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal.

疯王 令尊
The Mad King, your father,

劳勃·拜拉席恩 还有莱安娜 那时她已经和劳勃订了婚
Robert Baratheon, and Lyanna. She was already promised to Robert.

你可以想像 对于一个小地方来的 籍籍无名的小子 当时是什么感觉 看着那些传奇人物 在竞技场比武争冠
You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists.

进入决赛的两名骑士
The last two riders were

是巴利斯坦·赛尔弥和雷加·坦格利安
Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen.

当雷加夺冠后 所有人都为王子高声欢呼
When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince.

我记得当他脱掉头盔 露出一头银发 所有女孩都为之欢笑
I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair.

直到他纵马经过妻子 伊莉亚·马泰尔 所有的笑容都僵住了
Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

我从未见过那么多人鸦雀无声
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

他越过了他的妻子 将冰雪玫瑰桂冠放在莱安娜膝上
He rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap.

成千上万人因为雷加选择你的姑姑而丧命
How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

然后绑架了她 强奸了她
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

我们换个地方说话 免得亡灵们听见
Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us.

你换了骑马装?  是的
Dressed for riding? I am.

我们可不能让她起疑心
We must not let her sniff out any trouble.

你不能把我丢在这儿
You can't leave me here.

我知道和你鄙视的人共处有多艰难 相信我
I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me.

不会太久的
But it won't be for long.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩驻军在黑城堡
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.

在大雪封路之前他定会南下进军君临
He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way.

但是首先 他必须拿下临冬城
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

你怎么能肯定 我很肯定
You don't know that. I do.

一旦他从波顿家族手中拿下这些地盘 就会把你父亲的封臣收归麾下
Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause.

有了北境的支持
With the North behind him,

史坦尼斯才能拿下铁王座
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

你觉得他能击败波顿家族? 
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

他麾下军队更强大
He has a larger army.

而且他是维斯特洛最杰出的指挥官
He's the finest military commander in Westeros.

任何赌徒都会押注在史坦尼斯身上
A betting man would put his money on Stannis.

我就是这样一个赌徒
As it happens, I am a betting man.

史坦尼斯会攻克临冬城 将你从北境最令人不齿的家族手中解救出来
Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North.

史坦尼斯会感激你父亲曾经有胆识的支持他继位 并封你为北境守护
Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.

但我… 我不…
But I... I wouldn't...

北境守护…  你是唯一幸存的史塔克
Wardeness of the North... You are the last surviving Stark.

如果你押错了呢? 
What if you're wrong?

如果史坦尼斯不攻打临冬城 又或者他来攻打却吃了败仗呢? 
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?

那你就嫁给波顿家的儿子 拉姆斯 让他对你言听计从
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.

我不知道该怎么做 你当然知道
I don't know how to do that. Of course you do.

他已经被你迷倒了
He's already fallen for you.

我很害怕他父亲 这很正常 他的确是个危险人物
His father frightens me. He should, he's a dangerous man.

但即使最危险的人也可以智取
But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered.

而你正师从世上最足智多谋之人
And you learned to maneuver from the very best.

我很快就会回来
I return before too long.

我不在身边你会更坚强
You'll be strong without me.

北境必将属于你
The North will be yours.

我想等你回来我就是有夫之妇了
I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.

刚才你要是死了可不太光彩
That would have been a shit way to die.

要我说 怎么死都不光彩
As far as I've seen, they're all shot way to die.

是啊 但是你们这种人在歌手的故事里应该有个精彩的结局
Aye. But y'all ought to give the singers a good ending.

我不在乎死后歌手怎么唱我
I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.

两个骑士 解救公主
Two knights, off to rescue a princess.

要我说这歌肯定不错 跟别的歌也没什么两样
Sounds like a good song to me. Sounds like all the rest.

你呢? 你会选择怎么个死法? 
What about you? What shit way would you choose?

在我自个儿的城堡 喝着自个儿的酒 看着我的儿子们争夺我的财产
In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my son gravel from a fortune.

真无聊 我还以为你有什么刺激的想法
How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.

我活的够刺激了 最好还是死的无聊点儿
I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring.

你又想怎么死?  死在我爱的女人怀里
How do you want to go? In the arms of the woman I love.

她也这么想吗? 
She want the same thing?

那条船的船长…
The captain to that ship...

他是哪儿人 布拉佛斯?  潘托斯人
What was he, Braavosi? Pentoshi.

他要去旧镇
And he's headed to Oldtown.

他为什么不把船靠岸 告诉当地人詹姆·兰尼斯特到了多恩? 
What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?

我想你还不明白 这地方有多少人仇恨你的家族
I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.

我猜他肯定各种赌咒发誓才拿到那笔钱
And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.

但是他破了誓你也不知道
But you won't be around if he breaks them.

你能打几个? 
How many you think you can take?

你们从君临来
You're from King's Landing.

口音太明显了哈
Accent gave you away?

我们晚上翻了船
Our ship capsized in the night.

好不容易游上了岸
We managed to swim ashore.

真是死里逃生
It was a near thing, really.

我以为要喂鲨鱼了
I thought the sharks would get us.

多恩没有鲨鱼
There are no sharks in Dorne.

我发誓看到了鲨鱼鳍
I could have sworn those were shark fins.

把剑扔到地上
Throw your swords in the sand.

伙计们 没这个必要吧
Boys, there's no need for this.

给我们指个路就行
Just, point us in the right direction.

我们会自己回家的
We'll find our way home.

这家伙应该够慢了
That one should be slow enough.

你有个好老师
You had a wonderful teacher.

我一直都想要匹多恩骏马
Always wanted a Dornish stallion.

这畜牲跑一天一夜都不嫌累
Beasts can run a day and night without tiring.

现在我们吹着小风就骑到流水花园了
We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.

我们得先把尸体埋了
But first we need to bury these bodies.

鸟也得吃东西啊
Birds have to eat too.

尸体会带来麻烦 麻烦会引来军队
Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies.

我们不是来开战的
We're not here to start a war.

你知道咱俩挖这么多坑得花多久吗? 
Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?

我一只手可挖不好坑
I can't dig very well with one hand.

娜梅 奥芭娅 会开战吗? 
Nym, Obara. Will it be war?

道朗亲王会哀悼你父亲 仅此而已
Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else.

我们只能自己为奥柏伦报仇
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

道朗不支持 我们没有军队对抗兰尼斯特
Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.

开战不一定得要军队
We don't need an army to start a war.

瑟曦太后很爱她的孩子们
Queen Cersei loves her children.

其中一个在我们手里 我们可能有个麻烦
...and we have one of them. We may have a problem.

这个船长来板条镇找到我 说有个消息要卖给我
A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell.

他说他把詹姆·兰尼斯特运到了多恩
He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

他是为弥赛菈而来
He's come for Myrcella.

如果他先我们一步接触弥赛菈 我们就失去了复仇的唯一机会
If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge.

支持道朗 维持和平 或者支持我… 开战
Doran's way and peace, or my way...  and war.

我追随你 永远
I'm with you. Always.

我小时候 奥柏伦找到我 说要带我进宫
When I was a child, Oberyn came to take me to court.

我从来没见过他 他却自称是我父亲
I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father.

我母亲哭着说 我还小 又是女孩
My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.

奥柏伦把他的矛扔在我脚下 说
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said

我父亲指了指自己的长矛 又指了指母亲的眼泪
My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears.

很久以前我就做出了选择
I made my choice long ago.

没有酒我可睡不着
I can't sleep without wine.

你走反方向了
You're going the wrong way.

我姐姐在维斯特洛
My sister's in Westeros.

我们正往东走…
We're heading east...

我没打算带你去见你姐姐
I'm not taking you to your sister.

那你说带我去见陛下
You said you were taking me to the Queen.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安陛下
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

她才是我效忠的女王
She's the Queen I serve.

真是白瞎了这么成功的绑架
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

刚巧我正要去那里
So happens I was heading there myself!

你找女王要干什么? 
What business would you have with the Queen?

你要是见过我老姐 自然明白
If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand.

这么说… 我们显然是一边的
So...  now that it's clear we're on the same side.

一位来自维斯特洛北境的出身高贵的骑士 沦落到厄斯索斯
A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos.

胸甲上却是熊的家徽
Bear sigil breast plate.

你是乔拉·莫尔蒙
You're Jorah Mormont.

我必须得问问… 你在千里之外的妓院里厮混 怎么算是效忠你的女王了? 
I have to ask...  how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away?

有没有可能 你正在逃亡? 
Is it possible, that you were running?

你为什么要逃亡? 
Why would you be running?

她为何要赶你走呢? 
And why would she have sent you away?

你原本是在监视她 对不对? 
You were spying on her, weren't you?

这下我想起来了
It's all coming back to me!

尽管每次御前会议我都醉醺醺的 但是我全想起来
I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back.

你给瓦里斯的小小鸟递消息
You passed notes to Varys's little birds.

被她发现了 是吗? 
She found out, didn't she?

发现之后就把你流放了
Found out, and exiled you.

现在你希望带一件礼物 讨回她的欢心
And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift.

甚至可以说是孤注一掷
One might even say, desperate.

你认为丹妮莉丝会处决我 然后宽恕你? 
Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you?

我觉得很可能正好相反
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

从这看去 人人都很开心
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

我想起了你哥哥
I was thinking of all the times your brother

巴利斯坦·赛尔弥 他总是走出红堡 到君临街头 要我跟着
'无畏的' 女王铁卫 made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.

为什么?  他喜欢到人民之中 他喜欢为他们唱歌
Why? He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.

雷加会在钩巷或者种子街 找块地方演唱
Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and he'd sing.

就跟其他歌手一样
Just like all the other minstrels.

我确保他不会被暗杀
I made sure no one killed him.

啊… 我还会收钱
And... I collected the money.

他想看看自己能挣多少钱
Well... he liked to see how much he could make.

他唱得好吗?  非常好
He was good? He was very good.

韦赛里斯没跟你说过? 
Viserys never told you?

他说雷加武艺高强
He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people.

但雷加不喜欢打打杀杀
Rhaegar never liked killing.

收来的钱用来做什么呢? 
And what did you do with the money?

有一次我们把钱给了街头的另一个歌手
Well, one time, we gave it to the next minstrel down the street.

又一次给了跳蚤窝的一个孤儿
One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

还有一次… 我们喝得烂醉
One time...  we got horribly drunk.

西茨达拉来了 正在觐见室等候
Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber.

有多少人在等? 
How many others are there?

你跟我一起吗 巴利斯坦爵士? 
Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?

我想您接见西茨达拉·佐·洛拉克的时候 我可以保护您
I think I can protect you from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.

接见西茨达拉·佐·洛拉克的时候我能保护自己
I think I can protect me from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.

但并非所有人都能死的光荣 光荣? 
But not all can die in glory. Glory?

不然人们为何战斗? 
Why else do men fight?

您的先祖为何会跨过狭海 征服七国? 
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

为了名垂青史
So their names would live on.

那些在竞技场上获胜的人 虽然不会成为国王… 但他们也会名垂青史
Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings...  but their names will live on.

竞技场是他们最好的机会
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

你们为了取乐 让人们自相残杀的时候 也是这么对他们说的吗? 
Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?

陛下 依照传统 今天是竞技场赛季开幕日
Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.

我不承认这一传统
I do not recognize this tradition.

传统是唯一把这座城市 您的城市 团结起来的根基
Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city... your city, together.

没了传统 前奴隶和主子们没有任何共同语言
Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common.

除了数百年的猜忌 和仇恨
Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment.

竞技场不一定能解决所有问题 但这是个很好的开始
I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems...  but it's a start.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
'无畏的' 女王铁卫

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

我由衷地哀悼 女王陛下
I'm so sorry, my queen.

'无畏的'巴利斯坦 他们这么称呼他
'Barristan the Bold' they called him.

他横跨了整个大陆来向我效忠
He crossed a continent to serve me.

他是个忠诚的朋友
He was a loyal friend.

却死在小巷里 惨遭蒙面懦夫们的毒手
And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.

我们可以后撤到金字塔区 把那清场 将之作为行动的大本营
We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate.

然后我们肃清整个城市 逐街逐巷搜个底朝天 直到鼠辈们无处藏身
Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.

我更喜欢你之前的建议
I prefer your earlier suggestion.

把弥林城所有大家族的族长都抓起来带给我
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.

但我是我们家族的族长
But I'm the leader of my family.

我与此毫无瓜葛, 
I had nothing to do with this.

不想让他们吃得太饱
Don't want to overfeed them.

'尽管丹妮莉丝仍然控制着奴隶湾
'And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay,

山姆威尔・塔利 城内城外的敌对势力已暗流汹涌
'杀手' 守夜人事务官 forces rise against her from within and without.

在被解放的奴隶能够永葆自由前, 她拒绝离开弥林'
She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure.'

听上去她是个不简单的女人
She sounds like quite a woman.

她孤立无援 被围攻 没有家人引导她或保护她
And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her.

她最后的亲人在千里之外 毫无用处 濒临死亡
Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.

别这么说, 伊蒙学士
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

世上唯一一个坦格利安 太可怕了
A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing.

山姆, 我需要和学士私下谈谈
Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

感觉就像个百岁老人 在慢慢地冻死
Oh, like a hundredyearold man slowly freezing to death.

有一件事我想去做, 一件… 我必须做的事情
There's something I want to do, something I...  have to do.

但是它会分裂守夜人军团
But it'll divide the Night's Watch.

一半人会从我下令起就恨我
Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.

有一半人已经恨你了, 总司令大人
Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander.

但是你还不知道我说的什么事
But you don't know what it is.

你会发现担任司令不会有什么舒心的事
You will find little joy in your command.

但是运气好的话 你可以得到力量来完成必须做的事
But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.

杀死心中的男孩, 琼恩・雪诺
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

冬天几乎就要降临了
Winter is almost upon us.

杀死心中的男孩 成为一个真正的男人
Kill the boy and let the man be born.

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人

余下的自由民都在哪? 
Where are the rest of the free folk now?

他们去哪了? 
Where have they gone?

他们不会听命其他任何人
They won't follow anyone else.

戴着镣铐很难领导别人
Hard to lead when you're in chains.

如果我解开你的镣铐呢? 
What if I unchained you?

你为什么这么做? 
Why would you do that?

因为你不是我的敌人
Because you are not my enemy.

杀死我的朋友时 你无疑就是我的敌人
You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.

八千年来 守夜人宣誓成为 守护王国的坚盾
For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men.

八千年来我们一直没完全理解这个誓言
And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath.

你们就是人类王国的一部分
You belong to the realms of men.

现在一切都不同了? 
And now everything is going to change?

因为现在我是守夜人军团的总司令
Because now I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

你想让我干什么
What would you have me do,

我要你去长城以北
I'd have you go north of the Wall.

召集所有余下的自由民 不管他们在哪 都把他们带到这里来
Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here.

我会打开城门 让他们通过
I'll open the gates for them and let them through.

我会找到土地给他们在长城以南定居
I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.

他们不会为你下跪 我也不会
They won't kneel for you and neither will I.

我不要他们向我下跪
I don't want them to kneel for me.

我要他们当决战到来时 能与我并肩战斗
I want them to fight with me when the time comes.

我要叫我们的人给乌鸦卖命 就会被开膛破肚 扯出肠子 再被逼着吃下去的
The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.

你们有多少人没法作战
And how many of your people can't fight?

女人, 孩子, 老人, 病人… 他们会怎样? 
The women, the children, the old, the sick what happens to them?

你任由他们遭受死亡
You're condemning them to death.

甚至比死亡更悲惨的命运 只因自己太过骄傲 不愿讲和
Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace.

又或许你并非骄傲
Or maybe you're not proud.

只是懦弱罢了
Maybe you're just a coward.

说一个被锁着的人懦弱倒是容易
Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

你们的人需要领导
Your people need a leader.

他们需要尽早到达长城以南, 不然就太晚了
And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late.

我们的时间所剩无几, 而他们更少
We don't have much time and they have less.

异鬼将至 你们的人首当其冲
The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first.

我没要你讲和来保住自己的皮囊
I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin.

想救同胞 就讲和
Make peace to save your people.

他们大多数人在艰难屯
Most of them are at Hardhome.

你知道这是哪吗? 
You know where that is?

在斯托德之角的尖端
Up on Storrold's Point.

我可以给你 10 匹马, 9 个人和你同行
I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.

一周之内就可以到达
You can get there in a week.

我会和史坦尼斯国王商讨借船一事
I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.

你得和我一起来
You're coming with me.

你是守夜人军团的总司令
You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

他们需要听你亲口说
They need to hear it from you.

他们需要知道登上的船 不会在大海中被烧毁
They need to know the ships they are boarding won't be torched in the middle of the sea.

和我一起来 不然我不走
You come with me or I don't go.

你要让野人通过我们的城墙? 
You'd bring wildlings here through our gates?

如果我们不这么做, 数千男女老幼就会死去
Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

让他们去死吧 我们有自己的事要操心
Let them die. We got our own to worry about.

戴佛斯・席渥斯

听着, 在赠地有不少良田
Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift.

没有人耕种的良田
Land that no one uses now.

只是十数座小村庄
A dozen abandoned villages.

你以为农夫们为什么遗弃村庄? 
And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?

因为野人常年累月的劫掠那里
Because the wildlings raided them for years.

就像他们残杀这个孩子的家人那样
Just like they did this boy's people.

我们与野人打了几千年
We've been fighting them for thousands of years.

他们屠戮村民
They've slaughtered villages.

残杀我们的弟兄
They've slaughtered our brothers.

我们也杀了他们的兄弟
And we've slaughtered theirs.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

你知道的 无论你去哪 我都追随你
I will follow you anywhere, you know that.

但他们杀了葛兰 是的
But they killed Grenn. Yes.

杀了派普 没错
And they killed Pyp. Aye.

杀了 50 个弟兄
They killed 50 of our brothers.

你去过先民拳峰
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

你知道如果我们对野人弃之不顾 他们会变成什么
If we abandon them, you know what they become.

我们要么学着与野人共处 要么就眼睁睁地看着他们变成尸鬼
We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead.

不管他们现在怎样 总比尸鬼好
Whatever they are now, they're better than that.

有什么想说的 就说吧
If you have something you want to say to me, say it.

你不是认真的 对吧? 
You don't mean it, do you?

和野人讲和
Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.

只是个圈套
You're just doing it to trick them.

他们烧了我的村子
They burned my village.

一箭射穿了我爸的脑袋 我眼睁睁地看着
They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me.

他们杀了我妈 杀了所有我认识的人
They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.

我明白失去心爱之人是何滋味
I know what it's like to lose the people you love.

我明白这对你不容易
I know this is hard for you.

但凛冬将至
But winter is coming.

我们都知道随之而来的是什么
We know what's coming with it.

我们无法独自面对
We can't face it alone.

您还需要什么 总司令大人? 
Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?

她距兰尼斯特千里之遥
She's far away from the Lannisters.

或许珊莎小姐在这里更好
Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

更好?  波顿杀了她的哥哥和母亲
Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother?

珊莎身处险境 而她未必明了
Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.

您在这里生活了很久吧? 
You've lived here a long time?

您认得艾德大人么? 
Did you know Lord Eddard?

我认得他 也认得他父亲
I knew him and his father before him.

史塔克们早就不在了
The Starks are gone now.

我知道城堡里的是谁
I know who's inside that castle.

我说的不是波顿
I'm not talking about the Boltons.

我需要给她带个信
I need to get a message to her.

某个发誓要护她平安的人
Someone who swore to keep her safe.

但这并不能解除我的誓言
That doesn't release me from an oath.

我向凯特琳夫人效忠
I served Lady Catelyn.

我瞧见你怎么看她了
I saw you staring at her.

我要娶她
I'm going to marry her.

所以时不时看看很正常
That will involve looking at her from time to time.

你说过要娶我!
You said you'd marry me.

但那时我是个姓雪诺的私生子
When I was a bastard named Snow.

如今我可是波顿了
But I'm a Bolton now.

不能为所欲为
What I want is no longer the primary consideration.

我有一个王朝要延续呢
I'm furthering a dynasty.

你觉得她长得好看? 
Do you think she's pretty?

你也觉得她长得好看
You think she's pretty, too.

我可期待我俩的新婚之夜呢
I'm looking forward to our wedding night.

但别担心 我还有大把的时间能陪你
But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.

或许我也会结婚
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

你是狗舍总管的女儿
You're the kennel master's daughter.

你能嫁给谁? 马厩总管的儿子? 
Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son?

你哪都不准去
You're not going anywhere.

除非我听够了你吃醋的话
Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy.

嫉妒让我无聊 你知道让我无聊的人都是什么下场
Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me.

你不会让我嫌烦吧 米兰达? 
You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?

我是来添水的
I've come to refill the wash basin.

你在北境还有朋友
You still have friends in the North.

如果遇到麻烦 就在残塔最高的窗户上点一支蜡烛
If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.

但是谁…  你并不孤单
But whoYou're not alone.

我叫米兰达 狗舍总管的女儿
I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.

是谁教你的?  我母亲
Who taught you? My mother.

对她的遭遇我很遗憾
I'm sorry for what happened to her.

她教你这些真好
It's good that she taught you.

每次你穿着自己做的衣服 都能想起她
Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.

我宁愿母亲还活着
I'd rather have a mother.

我知道 这不一样
I know. It's not the same.

但是 有个念想总是好的
Still, it's good to remember.

记得过去的事情
Remember the way things were.

有个东西 大概能帮你记起点什么
There's something else to help you remember.

就在最里面
Down there at the end.

提前说出来就不是惊喜了
That would spoil the surprise.

往前走 很安全的
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

你一定想不到会见到什么
You won't believe it when you see it.

你不该来这
You shouldn't be here.

你今晚挺好闻的嘛
You smell particularly ripe this evening.

有什么事要和我说? 
Do you have something to tell me?

她来了狗舍
She came to the kennels.

是的 老爷 我很抱歉
Yes. I'm sorry, master.

原谅我 我没想…
Forgive me. I didn't think

你绝不能瞒我什么 臭佬
You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek.

小姐 您的房间住的还习惯吧
I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.

是的 谢谢您 大人
Yes, thank you, my lord.

小姐 我们是一家人了 我们北境人
My lady, we are all a family, we northerners.

几千年前便血脉相连
Our blood ties go back thousands of years.

所以让我们为婚礼喝一杯
So I'd like to drink to our wedding.

愿我们的欢乐从卡林湾 一直洋溢到最后壁炉城
May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.

来到一个陌生的地方 应该挺不适应吧
It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.

这不是陌生的地方 这是我的家
This isn't a strange place. This is my home.

陌生的是人
It's the people who are strange.

我听说你俩见面了
I heard you two had reunited.

地方不错
A fitting place for it.

我猜你俩上次见面 就是在这个屋子里
I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room.

你还在生他的气么?  在他… 做出那些事情之后? 
Are you still angry with him after he...  what he did?

我惩罚过他了
I punished him for it.

他现在已经不是个铁种了
He's not ironborn anymore.

再也不是席恩・葛雷乔伊了
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

这么说吧 一个全新的人
A new person, anyway.

喏 臭佬就是他的新名字
That's his new nameReek.

你为何要这样做? 
Why are you doing this?

关于这个嘛 我想让臭佬自己说比较好
Because Reek has something to say to you.

为你所做的向珊莎小姐道歉
Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did.

为你谋杀她两个兄弟的事情道歉
Apologize for murding her two brothers.

如果你没有用目光看着一个人 道歉就毫无意义
An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.

对不起 为什么? 
I'm sorry. Sorry about what?

因为我杀了您的兄弟
For killing your brothers.

好了 这事儿告一段落
There, over and done with.

有人好受点了么? 反正我有
Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.

刚刚气氛是有点儿紧张
That was getting very tense.

您发现了么 小姐? 
You know what, my lady?

当他杀害了您的两个弟弟 您其他的家人也都去世了
What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone...

现在 臭佬可是世上活着的 最像是您的血亲的人了
Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left.

你来主持婚礼吧
You will give away the bride.

总有人这样做吧 有更好的人选么
Someone has to. What better person?

趁着大家都在 瓦妲和我也有点儿好消息告诉大家
Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.

我们要有孩子了
We're going to have a baby.

我由衷地为你们感到高兴
I'm very happy for you.

沃尔坎学士说 从她怀孕的症状来看
From the way she's carrying,

应该是个男孩
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

我的意思是 你怎么判断出来的
I mean...  how can you tell?

沃尔坎学士向我们保证万无一失
Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.

所以你到底是怎么做到的
So how did you manage it?

让她怀孕
Getting her pregnant.

我想你对这种事情应该很清楚
I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

当然 但你是如何...  做到的
Of course, but how did you...  find it?

晚宴上你的表现非常丢脸 在史塔克家的女孩面前把那个怪物牵出来
You disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the Stark girl.

你担心他会抢了你的位置吧
You're worried about your position.

我很清楚自己的位置
My position is quite clear.

我还是你儿子 除非有个更好的替代品
I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.

你从未向我问过你母亲的事情
You've never asked me about your mother.

她怀了我 然后她死了
She had me, she died.

她是个农家女孩
She was a peasant girl.

有几分姿色
Pretty in a common sort of way.

她同时也是一个磨坊主的老婆
She was the miller's wife.

显然 他们在我不知情的时候结了婚
Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent.

所以我吊死了那个男人 并把她带到吊死那个男人的树下强奸了她
So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying.

期间她一直在反抗
She fought me the whole time.

当然 我没把她吊死算是她的运气
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

一年后 她来到了我家门前 手中抱着一个哇哇大哭的小婴儿
A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms.

她说那是我的孩子
A baby she claimed was mine.

我差点抽了她一顿 想着要不要把那个孩子扔进河里
I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river.

但那时我看了你一眼 那眼神跟你现在一模一样
But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩在黑城堡有一支驻军
Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black.

但他不会在那里停留太久的
But he won't stay for long.

他最终还是要去争夺铁王座 临冬城可是前往君临的必经之路
He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell.

他想要夺取北境
He means to take the North.

但北境是我们的
But the North is ours.

你会帮我击败他吧?
Will you help me defeat him?

所有的书都在这里了吗?
Is this every book there is?

世界上所有的书 唔 当然不是
In the world. Well, no.

世上的书可有千千万万
There are thousands and thousands of books out there.

实际上 这座图书馆算非常小的了
This library is rather small, actually.

在你小的时候 你家的书比这里还多? 
Where you grew up, were there more books?

我父亲不算是很有文化那种
My father's not the most literate man.

他们说学城有世界上最大的图书馆
They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.

不好意思 我知道的东西太少了
I'm sorry I don't know things.

你比我会做的事情多太多了
You know how to do a hundred things I can never do.

你可以用湿木头生火
You can build a fire with wet wood.

你会煮饭 会缝合伤口
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

我现在只能洗床单还有扫地
I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

好吧 为什么学城会有世上最大的图书馆呢?
Well... Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?

因为那是训练学士的地方
It's where they train the maesters.

我年轻的时候也想成为他们中的一员
I wanted to be one when I was young.

不过我现在是守夜人的汉子了
Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.

不管怎么说 这儿的冒险多太多了
Far more adventure up here anyway.

而只有在这里我才能遇见你
I wouldn't have met you.

你是山姆威尔・塔利么?
You're Samwell Tarly?

你父亲是蓝道・塔利
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

他在岑树滩之战里击败了我的兄长
He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.

劳勃只输过这一仗
Only battle Robert ever lost.

那时我警告他不要急于西进 可他没听进去
I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened.

你父亲是个伟大的战士
Fine soldier, your father.

你看起来倒是一点儿也不像个战士
You don't look like a soldier.

不过我听说你杀了一个异鬼
But I'm told you killed a white walker.

用一把龙晶做的匕首刺穿了它
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

就是学士们称之为黑曜石的那种东西
What the maesters call obsidian.

我知道那是什么 龙石岛到处都是
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.

为什么黑曜石能杀死异鬼呢?
Why would obsidian kill a walker?

我翻遍了所有古老的手稿 想要从里面找到点儿什么 唯一知道的 就是森林之子曾经用龙晶来狩猎
I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.

梅丽珊卓女士告诉我 亡者向长城上进军
The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.

我看见过 陛下
I've seen it, Your Grace.

亡者的军队
The army of the dead.

如果他们真的来了 我们得知道怎么打败他们
And when they comeWe have to know how to fight them.

接着读书吧 山姆威尔・塔利
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

再等一下会不会更好? 
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

等琼恩・雪诺带着野人回来 我们会多出几千个人
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.

就算琼恩・雪诺真能带野人回来
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.

我们也等不了那么久
We can't wait that long.

目前我们有优势… 人多 马多 给养充足 休息得不错
We have the advantagemore men, more horses, all fed and rested.

但我们每多等一天 胜利的天平就会向波顿倾斜一点
But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

冬天随时都会到来
This could turn to winter at any moment.

我们现在得马上行动
We have to act now. Give the order.

我会挑点人留下的 保护王后和公主
I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.

不用了 她们随我们一同南下
No need. They're coming with us.

前路漫漫啊 陛下
It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace.

她们在这儿难道不会更安全?  这里? 
Won't they be saferHere?

一半的守夜人是杀手和强奸犯
Half these watchmen are killers and rapists.

她们得和我们一起走
No, they march with us.

如您所愿 陛下
As you wish, Your Grace.

你觉得我父亲会让我去地窖里玩么? 
Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?

所有北境之王都被埋葬在那里
All the Kings in the North are buried there.

'筑城者'布兰登 多伦王 还有…
Bran the Builder and King Dorren and

到时候再说 这可是漫漫长路
First things first. It's a long march ahead.

到时候我们就得拿下城堡
And then we have to take the castle.

在那边要打一场大仗吗? 
Is there going to be a battle?

是的 公主殿下 但是你不会出现在战场上的…
Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near

关于战争我们已经谈的太多了 戴佛斯爵士
That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos.

你会吓到她的
You'll scare the child.

我不害怕 我害怕
I'm not scared. Well, I am.

你要保证等他们打仗的时候来保护我
When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.

我希望你清楚你和这帮野人在干什么
I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings.

你会拿回这些船的 我发誓
You'll get them back, I swear it.

一路平安 陛下
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

你还很虚弱
You're still too weak.

你们是被伏击的 而且寡不敌众
You were ambushed, outnumbered.

你也无法知道敌人会在哪里
There was no way you could have known.

在战斗中受伤 不会让人羞愧
Wounded in war, there is no shame for this.

我羞愧 是因为我被刺伤 倒地的时候
I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground,

再也见不到纳斯岛的弥桑黛
I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.

您已经给了伟主们该有的下场
Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.

如果每个伟主都得到该有的下场
If I give everyone what they deserve,

那我就是光杆司令了
I'll have no one left to rule.

巴利斯坦爵士一开始就劝我施行仁政 直到他牺牲的那天早上也是这样说的
Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died.

达里奥 纳哈里斯说我应该杀掉伟主们 让这座城市自谋生路
Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself.

陛下 我想我没资格对这些事 发表意见
Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.

你跟别人一样可以建言献策
You are as fit as anyone I know.

你知道我是为了解放奴隶而来
You know why I'm here.

你也知道如果事态失控谁会受到灭顶之灾
And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart.

所以 告诉我你的忠告
So what do you think?

我只能告诉您我看到了什么 陛下
I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace.

我看见您从善如流
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

我也看见您不断地学习他人经验 仔细地权衡利弊得失
I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you.

但是为了更好的选择 您可以坚持到底 一意孤行
And I have seen you ignore your counselors...  because there was a better choice.

您能看到我们看不到的
One that only you could see.

陛下… 女王陛下 我求您了
Mymy queen, please do not do this.

你不是说'凡人必有一死'吗? 
What about 'valar morghulis'?

我不想死的像个懦夫
I did not want to die a coward.

我其实根本不想死
Apparently I do not want to die at all.

承认恐惧是需要勇气的
It takes courage to admit fear.

承认错误也是如此
And to admit a mistake.

我来是想告诉你 我犯了个错误
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

关于弥林的传统
I was wrong and you were right.

你的意见是正确的
About bringing the people of this city together.

我要重开竞技场
I will reopen the fighting pits.

只要我还活着 弥林就没有奴隶制
Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.

为了和弥林人建立长期可靠的关系
And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people,

我会下嫁给一位弥林的世家大族
I will marry the leader of an ancient family.

幸运的是一个求婚者已经在地上跪着了
Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 被放逐的骑士

我没事 没地方骨折 应该没有吧
I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.

整天阴着脸不说话 不高兴了照着脸来那么一下
Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face.

我为之前的事向你道歉
I apologize for before.

我有时候确实管不住自己的嘴
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

咱一路上没必要闹的不愉快
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

离弥林还有好大一段路呢 我们得一起走
We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

什么能让我们的旅途更加愉快呢 酒
What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.

我是个酒鬼啊拜托
I am a person who drinks.

酒鬼就是要不停地喝啊
People who drink need to keep drinking.

要不然怎么叫…
Otherwise, they're not...

你要带我穿过瓦雷利亚的废墟
You're taking us through Valyria.

你以前走过这条路吗
Have you sailed this route before?

你是觉得我这个礼物不够大 还得给你的女王陛下带一个她祖先之地的纪念品? 
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?

你这礼物已经够大了
I think you'll be plenty.

你知道那句话是怎么说的对吧
You know what they say.

末日依然笼罩着瓦雷利亚
The Doom still rules Valyria.

那恶魔和火焰呢? 
What about the demons and the flames?

你不怕末日阴影吗
Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

我们是在几百年前才学会 建造这样宏伟的城市的? 
How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again?

瓦雷利亚人在几千年的时间里 掌握着几乎一切东西
Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything.

那些东西全没了
And then they weren't.

全部没了
And then they weren't.

末日降临时他们紧紧相拥着回转过身
They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.

山峰被撕碎 天空被黑色遮盖
The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies;

灼热的火焰直冲天际 连龙也被焚化
The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned;

这些还不是他们 在最后一刻看到的东西
Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes.

黑影遮蔽城墙 狂风卷起巨浪 翻江倒海…
A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned'

千年的古城 智慧的结晶
The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned;

末日浩劫一视同仁 什么都改变不了
The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.'

我想 这就是了
I suppose this is it, then.

瓦雷利亚的遗迹
This is what remains.

别让他们碰到你!
Don't let them touch you!

莫尔蒙 快把我解开!
Mormont, cut me free!

你比你看起来的要重啊
You're heavier than you look.

他们有没有触碰到你? 
Did any of them touch you?

我之前看到过灰鳞病人 没一个有那么严重
I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.

所以他们才会被送到这儿来吧
I suppose that's why they send them there.

给他们心口来上一刀才是对他们的仁慈
It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it.

谢谢你救了我
Thank you for saving me.

当然 你要是一开始就没绑架我 你也用不着救我
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.

我们要沿着海岸线走
We walk up the coast.

运气好的话 我们能找到个渔村
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

老老实实走着去
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

我去找点柴火生个火
I'll get some wood for a fire.

然后休息一下 怎么样? 
Try to get some rest, huh?

你一整天就这一句话说点子上了
That's the best idea you've had all day.

他们要把尸体怎么样? 
What are they doing with the bodies?

不 我已经在这待了好几周
No. I've been here for weeks.

不想再擦死人了 除非你告诉我为啥要这样做
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.

什么时候?  合适的时候
When? When it's time, not before.

我什么时候才能玩那个游戏? 
When do I get to play the game?

就那个 那个变脸的游戏
The game. The Game of Faces.

你玩过 没玩好
You tried already. You failed.

我当时不知道游戏已经开始了
I didn't even know I was playing.

你在这里干什么? 怎么到这儿来的? 
What are you doing here? How did you get here?

我来自维斯特洛 和你一样
I'm from Westeros just like you.

我是贵族小姐 和你一样
Daughter of a lord just like you.

但我是独生女
Except I was an only child.

父亲续弦后 新妻子 给他生了个女儿
My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

我的继母想为宝贝女儿铺平道路 试图毒死我
My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter, so she tried to kill me with poison.

向无面者求助
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

于是我父亲又成了鳏夫
And my father was widowed again.

从那时起 我便侍奉他们
I've been serving them ever since.

这是真事 还是个谎言? 
Was that true or a lie?

我刚才说的你全都信了? 
Did you believe every word I said?

你从哪里来? 
And where did you come from?

我的家在临冬城
My family home is Winterfell.

我是公爵的小女儿
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,

他被处死后 我逃离首都
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

还不得不杀了一个马童

从背后一剑捅死了他
Drove my sword through his back.

我捅的是他的肚子
I stabbed him in the gut.

我想去找母亲和哥哥 可一直没有找到
I tried to find my mother and brother, but I never did.

他们都被瓦德·佛雷谋害了
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

一个恶棍绑架了我 他叫波利佛
An outlaw kidnapped me, a man called Polliver.

他叫猎狗 桑铎·克里冈
A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

他想用我换赎金 但在一次打斗中受了重伤
He tried to sell me, but was wounded in a fight.

乞求我杀了他 我不愿这么做
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.

把他留在山里等死
I left him in the mountains to die.

我想让他受罪 我恨他
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

女孩对我撒谎 对千面之神撒谎 对她自己撒谎
A girl lies to me, to the ManyFaced God, to herself.

她真的想成为无名之辈么? 
Does she truly want to be no one?

我不想再玩这个白痴游戏了!
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

游戏没有停下那一天
We never stop playing.

喂 不是说好能在这找到村子么? 
So, those villages we were supposed to find?

光靠果子和树根活不下去的
We can't live on berries and roots.

当然饿
Of course I'm hungry.

你这旅伴非常差劲 知道么? 
You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that?

恐怕是我见过最差劲的
Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.

我不是你的旅伴
I'm not your travelling companion.

我俩互相陪伴一起旅行 因此…
We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore

我蹲在一个小箱子里从君临来到潘托斯 路上一句话没说
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate without ever saying a word.

到现在你才想来要问为什么? 
It never occurred to you to ask why until now?

你就从没想过为什么提利昂·兰尼斯特 决定去瓦兰提斯逛窑子? 
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

我敢肯定你去过许多城市 逛过许多窑子
I'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities.

他想要因为我没犯下的罪行处决我
He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit.

还上了我深爱的女人
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

你过得确实惨 莫尔蒙 但至少你父亲还是个好人
As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.

你又知道我父亲了? 
What do you know about my father?

我去过长城 见过他
I met him. I visited the Wall.

问起他手下的时候 他对每个人都了如指掌 无一遗漏
When I asked him about his men, he knew all their stories, every one of them.

真真切切地把下属放在了心上
He actually cared about the people under his command.

守夜人怎么悼念他来着? 
How do they put it in the Watch?

我只听到一些传闻
I only know what I heard.

他率队远征长城以北
He was leading an expedition beyond the Wall.

被自己的手下杀死了
He was murdered by his own men.

我们出发吧
We better keep moving.

我已经无处可去了
I have nowhere else to go.

我带她拜访了布拉佛斯的所有大夫
I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.

花掉了所有的钱
I've spent every penny I had.

可她还是天天遭受病痛折磨
She suffers every day of her life.

我只是想结束她的痛苦
I just want it to end.

我曾经和你一样
I used to be like you.

但我父亲从没有放弃我
But my father never gave up on me.

他爱我 胜过世上的一切 就像你的父亲爱着你一样
He loved me more than anything in the world, just like your father loves you.

于是他带我来到这里
So he brought me here.

我父亲向千面之神祈祷
My father prayed to the ManyFaced God.

然后我喝下泉水
And I drank the water from his fountain.

现在我已将自己奉献给了千面之神
I've devoted my life to him now.

想摆脱痛苦么? 
You don't want to hurt anymore?

放弃她的双耳 她的鼻子 她的舌头? 
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

放弃她的希望与梦想 她的爱与恨? 
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?

放弃一切表明她身份的事物? 
All that makes a girl who she is?

女孩还没有准备好成为无名之辈
A girl is not ready to become no one.

但已经准备好成为别的人
But she is ready to become someone else.

为什么是丹妮莉丝? 值得为她付出这么多吗? 
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

我记得在劳勃叛乱期间 莫尔蒙家族可是与坦格利安家族作对的
As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.

你有信仰么? 
Do you believe in anything?

我信仰很多东西
I believe in lots of things.

我是指一些超越我们存在的东西
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.

你相信命中注定这件事吗? 
Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

和你一样愤世嫉俗
I was a cynic just like you.

直到我目睹一个女孩 带着三枚石蛋步入熊熊烈火
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs.

火焰熄灭后 我原以为只能看到她烧焦的骨架
When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

结果 她就在那 丹妮莉丝 安然无恙 怀抱着幼龙
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

你听过幼龙的叫声吗? 
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

目睹这一切之后 人很难再愤世嫉俗下去
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

但这并不代表她会成为一位伟大的女王
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

坦格利安家族那股疯劲是出了名的
The Targaryens are famously insane.

就算她征服了世界 之后会怎样? 
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

一千年的太平盛世吗? 
1,000 years of peace and prosperity?

先等我们征服了世界再说
First we have to conquer the world.

好吧 就算你梦想成真
All right, let's assume your dreams come true.

她见你带回这个出身仇家的侏儒 欣喜若狂
She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf.

砍掉我的脑袋 让你官复原职
She hacks off my head and restores your position.

你统领着她的大军 驶向维斯特洛 击败所有敌人 目送她拾阶而上 坐进铁王座
You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the Iron Throne.

好耶 女王万岁 然后呢? 
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

也就是说 一个成年后从未在维斯特洛生活过哪怕一天的女人 成为维斯特洛的统治者 这公平吗? 
So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?

她是合法的继承人 为什么? 
She's the rightful heir. Why?

就因为她老爹 那个把活人烤着玩的家伙是国王? 
Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?

那是艘奴隶船  他们为什么在这儿下锚? 
That's a slave ship. Why are they anchored?

可能是来找…
They probably came ashore for

看起来你打过不少仗啊 是吧? 
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

可以 或者做划桨的奴隶
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

看起来还挺结实的
He looks strong enough.

那个侏儒呢? 
What about the dwarf?

等等 等等 等等 等等 等等! 有话好说
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.

再剁掉他的命根子
And then chop off his cock.

卖掉还能赚上一笔
We'll sell it for a fortune.

侏儒的命根子可是有魔力的
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

你不能随随便便把风干的命根子交给商人 就指望他会付钱
You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it.

他必须得确信这玩意来自侏儒
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

不见到侏儒本人的话 又如何确信呢? 
And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?

命根子尺寸也是侏儒型号的就行
It will be a dwarfsized cock.

先别杀这侏儒 等找到收购命根子的人再说
The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

丹妮莉丝女王已经禁止了奴隶贸易
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

我们要去瓦兰提斯 不是奴隶湾
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

另外 她重新开放了角斗场
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

我从没听说过自由人在角斗场里拚斗
I've never heard of free men fighting in the pits.

弥林的竞技场? 
The fighting pits in Meereen?

那你可真是走运了 很快就能一夜暴富
You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich.

你面前可是七大王国最伟大的战士之一
You are looking at one of the great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

他? 看起来都六十了
Him? He's got to be 60 years old.

没错 他面相可能显老 还有点憔悴 那是因为在太阳底下晒久了
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

这点人人都能看出来 但他是个身经百战的老兵
We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

歌手还为他写过歌谣
They wrote songs about him.

他赢得过兰尼斯港的比武大会
He won the tournament at Lannisport.

把詹姆·兰尼斯特击落马下
Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

长枪比武 你说的是长枪比武
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

贵族老爷们打闹着玩罢了
A fancy game for fancy lads.

弥林竞技场的角斗士会把他生吞下去
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen will swallow him whole.

我单挑杀死过一个多斯拉克血盟卫
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.

我没胡说 他叫柯索
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

卓戈卡奥的血盟卫
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

带我去奴隶湾 给我一把剑
Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand,

为了我的孩子 赏点钱吧
For my children. Money.

培提尔·贝里席
'小指头' 峡谷守护者

我们已经抛弃了姓氏
We abandon our family names.

好一个抛弃的姓氏
Quite a family to abandon.

这座城市已经和您离开时不一样了
The city has changed since you were here last.

我们把酒倒进了下水道 摧毁了对伪神的崇拜 放逐了无信之人
We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and set the godless on the run.

我来是和太后商议要事
I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother.

要不要知会她我有事耽搁了? 
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

一路当心 贝里席大人
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

你会发现在焕然一新的君临里 贩卖肉体的人没有容身之处
You'll find there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

我们其实都在贩卖幻想 蓝赛尔兄弟
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

我卖的碰巧能供娱乐罢了
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

陛下 您觉得逮捕高庭继承人 是明智之举吗? 
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?

逮捕高庭继承人的是教会
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

当然了 但教会是听从您的命令才武装起来的
Of course, and the Faith were armed on your orders.

洛拉斯爵士的伤风败俗该怪罪到国王头上吗? 
Is the king to blame for Ser Loras's perversion?

提利尔家族不会容忍这次侮辱的
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

提利尔家族不会容忍? 
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

我才是受到侮辱的一方 贝里席大人
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

洛拉斯爵士和我订了婚
Ser Loras was promised to me.

但仍选择与男人为伴
Instead he chose the company of boys.

人们会选谁做伴侣这事还真不好说
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

就拿莱莎·艾林来说
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

从头到脚令人生厌
Thoroughly repellant woman.

我知道您还在为她哀悼
I know you're still in mourning.

莱莎是个好女人
Lysa was a good woman.

她根本配不上这两个词 你我都明白
She was neither of those things. We both know it.

不过 我还是同情她的儿子
Still, I pity her son.

谷地的年轻领主能有一位新的父亲来辅佐 真是再幸运不过了
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.

我明白在这等幼龄就失去双亲 是多么艰难
I know how hard it can be to lose both your parents at such a young age.

如果维斯特洛燃起战火 谷地的骑士们会为国王而战吗? 
If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

年轻的罗宾大人需要我的建议
Young Lord Robin needs my advice.

而我一直在忠实地为铁王座服务
And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.

没有别的事情就退下吧
If there's nothing else.

还有一件事 陛下
There is another matter, Your Grace.

一件非常紧急的事情 必须当面告诉您
Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

您曾经派我去寻找艾莉亚·史塔克
You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.

我失败了 非常惭愧
To my shame, I failed you.

但是我找到了珊莎·史塔克
But I have found Sansa Stark.

她还活着 活得好好的 而且已经返乡 现在就在临冬城
Alive and well and home again living at Winterfell.

我的眼线不会有误
My sources are well placed.

他们告诉我卢斯·波顿 打算把她嫁给他儿子拉姆斯 一个不久前才被托曼国王授予合法身份的私生子
They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.

卢斯·波顿多亏我父亲开恩才成为北境守护
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.

是啊 靠捅死他的国王赚来了奖赏
Indeed, his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.

我们竟然愚蠢到会信任这条变色龙
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

相比和南方的仇敌家族结盟 让他儿子娶史塔克家的遗孤为妻 会让他在北境赢取更多的合法权力
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.

我要剥了他和他那野种的皮 就像他们家徽上那个可怜虫一样
I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

要耐心 陛下
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

珊莎合伙杀了我儿子
Sansa helped murder my son.

卢斯·波顿是个叛徒
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩也是个叛徒 他正向临冬城进军
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his armyon Winterfell.

让史坦尼斯和卢斯打吧
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

让我们的敌人打得两败俱伤
Let the enemies of thethrone slaughter each other.

然后不管哪个叛徒惨胜 我们都可以拿下临冬城
And when they're done, seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

临冬城距我们千里之遥
Winterfell is 1,000 milesaway from here.

天气转冷
The weather has already begun to turn.

所以我们要尽快发兵 趁得势一方元气大伤之际 一锤定音
That is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds.

您的凯冯叔叔肯定能召集一支军队
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

我的凯冯叔叔胆小如鼠
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.

詹姆正在执行一项敏感的政治任务
Jaime's away on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

不知何时才能归来
I have no idea when he'll be back.

谷地的骑士在维斯特洛也是数一数二的 久经风雪考验
The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

恕我直言 贝里席大人 你是个放贷人 是妓院老板 却并非行伍之人
Forgive me, Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a moneylender and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

兰尼斯特家不用出一兵一卒 国库也不用出一分钱
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury.

您会损失什么呢
What do you have to lose?

我要北境守护的任命状
Name me Warden of the North.

今晚我会向国王进言 让陛下签署一份王家敕令
I'll speak to the king this evening, have him issue a royal decree.

金狮旗飘扬在临冬城之前 不敢稍有懈怠
I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.

等珊莎·史塔克的人头插上枪尖 我便知道您信守诺言了
And I'll know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

我明天去求他
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

他不同意怎么办? 他不会的
What if he says no? He won't.

我们等得太久了
We've waited long enough.

我想娶你
I want you to be my wife.

你是因为我们两家的安排才要娶我的吗? 
Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it?

还是你…
Or do you…

你知道的 别人会看到的
You know why not. Someone will see.

我将娶你
You are going to be my wife.

你将嫁我
I am going to be your husband.

我们漫步在这流水花园是天经地义
We're allowed to walk through the gardens together.

你跟多少姑娘在这儿漫步过了? 
How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?

我喜欢你嫉妒的时候斜眼看我的样子
I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.

我才没有斜眼 而你没回答我的问题
They do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question.

他们是很可爱的一对儿
They make a lovely couple.

兰尼斯特和马泰尔家族的一对儿
A Lannister and a Martell.

但他们不知道这有多危险
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

我们得保护他们
We must protect them.

你很久没有使过你的斧子了
You haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time.

但愿你还记得怎么用
I hope you remember how.

多恩人的妻子像艳阳一样美丽
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

她的亲吻比阳春还暖意
And her kisses were warmer than spring

多恩人的刀剑
The Dornishman's blade

却是由黑铁制成
It was made of black steel

它们的亲吻则恐怖无比
And its kiss was a terrible thing

多恩人的妻子洗浴之际会唱歌
The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed

像蜜桃一样甜美的声调…     行了 够了
In a voice that was sweet as a peach... All right, that's enough.

我正要唱到高潮部分
I'm coming to the best part.

我们是要偷偷潜进流水花园
We're trying to blend in.

我不想让多恩人认出你的口音
Don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.

这首歌的精华就在结尾 真的
This song really is all about the ending.

流水花园到了
That's the Water Gardens.

我们救出公主之后呢
And once we've got the princess, then what?

金手接白刃也是临场发挥咯
That explains the golden hand.

不屈不挠
Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.

看 她在这儿倒挺自在
Well, she's made herself at home.

我不明白 你怎么到这儿来了? 
I don't understand. What are you doing here?

我们私下谈吧
Let's speak in private.

我是崔斯丹·马泰尔 崔斯丹是我的未婚夫
I am Trystane Martell. Trystane is my intended.

好极了 很高兴见到你
Excellent. Good to meet you.

我们没想到您会现在来 詹姆大人
We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.

为什么不让他们私下谈谈呢 孩子? 
Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?

咱别做傻事 成吗
Let's not do something stupid.

这么着就叫做傻事
That was something stupid.

我们必须离开这儿 弥赛菈 现在就走
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

你伤着他了! 他会没事的 我保证
You hurt him!  He'll be fine, I promise.

快跟我走  我不想跟你走
You're coming with me. I don't want to.

我没打算征求你意见 公主殿下
I wasn't asking, princess.

啊! 放下武器!
Ah! Drop your weapons!

奥柏伦·马泰尔的女儿
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

我为多恩而战 你为谁而战? 
I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

你双手健全的话 我们本可以大打一场
When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.

小姑娘打得不赖
You fight pretty good for a little girl.

哦 老远就闻到君临的烂臭味儿了
Oh, you can smell the shit from five miles away.

奥莲娜·提利尔
'荆棘女王'玛格丽的祖母

我们怎么停下来了?  继续走啊
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

谣言和嚼舌头 他们只会这个
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.

君临就是个戏园子 没别的
It's theater, nothing more.

如果他们每一个同性恋都抓 地牢里就装不下别的犯人了
If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing, there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.

所有人都知道他跟蓝礼的事
Everyone knew about him and Renly.

蓝礼·拜拉席恩上过七大王国里一半的马僮
Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

所有人都知道 但没人过问
Everyone knew, no one cared.

但他是国王的兄弟
But he was the king's brother.

洛拉斯现在是王后的兄弟
And Loras is the queen's brother.

不 不 不 这完全不可接受
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

瑟曦是幕后主谋 哦 她当然是的
Cersei's behind it.Yeah, of course she is.

她想让我们家名誉扫地 自己滚回高庭去
She wants to drag our name through the dirt, put us in our place.

去休息吧亲爱的 你看上去被吓坏了
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.

让我来对付瑟曦·兰尼斯特
Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

陛下 我赶了很远的路来的
Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.

你一定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

放下笔吧 亲爱的 你我都知道你什么也没写
Put the pen down, dear. We both know you're not writing anything.

啊 好的 鼎鼎大名 伶牙俐齿的荆棘女王
Ah, yes. The famously tarttongued Queen of Thorns.

不敢当 鼎鼎大名 牙尖嘴利的瑟曦太后
And the famous tart Queen Cersei.

我知道你是逮捕我孙子的幕后主谋
I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

你如果为这诽谤道歉 或许我可以
If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll

我会道歉的 在洛拉斯被释放之后
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

得知洛拉斯爵士被教廷逮捕的时候 我和其他人一样震惊
I was as shocked as anyone when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.

我对这些宗教狂也没有好感 但一个王太后能做什么呢? 
I have no love for these fanatics, but what can a Queen Mother do?

难道王室一夜之间就不需要 我们提利尔家的军队 金子 和麦子了吗
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?

我向你保证 王室与提利尔家的联盟依然
I can assure you, our alliance with House Tyrell remains

你们把提利尔家的继承人下了大狱 还指望这联盟维持下去吗? 
Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?

我没有逮捕任何人
I didn't imprison anyone.

至于你暗示的威胁
As for your veiled threats

兰尼斯特和提利尔的联盟给饱受战火的国家带来了和平
The LannisterTyrell alliance brought peace to a wartorn country.

你真的想让国家重回战乱之中吗? 
Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

我并没有相信过你父亲
I didn't trust your father.

我也并不很喜欢他
I didn't particularly like him.

但我尊敬他 他才智过人
But I respected him. He was no fool.

他知道有时候得和对手合作 而不是赶尽杀绝
He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.

兰尼斯特家族没有对手
House Lannister has no rival.

总主教大人只是要进行询问 而非审判
The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial.

只是一个小小的听证 来查明对洛拉斯爵士的指控是否属实 当然 我相信是不属实的
Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't.

洛拉斯爵士会被无罪释放 我们的联盟会继续下去 我们当然也会忘了这次不愉快的谈话
Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue...  and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened.

日安 奥莲娜夫人
Good day, Lady Olenna.

你是否注意到关于你和蓝礼的谣言? 
You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?

我不屑于听信谣言
I don't pay attention to rumors.

有人说你在他遇刺身亡后十分沮丧
You were said to be despondent when he died.

证人说你拒绝离开他的棺床旁边 甚至史坦尼斯的军队逼近之时也是如此
Witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside even as Stannis's army closed in.

他是我的朋友 是我的国王
He was my friend. He was my king.

难道乔佛里不是你的国王? 
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

乔佛里是七神加冕的国王 蓝礼不是
He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.

我不该支持蓝礼称王 这我知道
I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that.

可乔佛里已经原谅了我
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

我在黑水河为他而战
I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.

没错 还穿着蓝礼的盔甲
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

我穿什么重要吗? 
Why does it matter what I wore?

你否认所有对你的指控吗? 
Do you deny all the charges against you?

我当然否认
Of course I deny them.

你从未和蓝礼·拜拉席恩同床共枕? 
You never lay with Renly Baratheon?

就这样吧 洛拉斯爵士
That will be all, Ser Loras.

行了 我想就到此为止吧
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

教廷召玛格丽皇后上前
The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

是的 我们有问题要问你
Yes, we have some questions for you.

我是王后 没错
I am the queen. You are.

按照七国律法 在教廷审判上 不管是国王还是王后 都不能拒绝出席作证
And according to the law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.

你对你哥哥的指控有何看法? 
How do you respond to these charges against your brother?

全是? 全是
All of them? All of them.

玛格丽王后 你是否能在诸神面前起誓 证明就你所知而言 你哥哥清白无辜 从未犯过上述罪行? 
Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge?

谢谢 殿下
Thank you, Your Grace.

你认识这人吗? 
Do you know this man?

他是洛拉斯·提利尔爵士 高庭的继承人
He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

你们怎么认识的? 
How did you come to meet?

他喜欢我
He took a liking to me.

第一天见面 他就召我去他的房间
He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.

在他房间里发生了什么? 
And what occurred in his chamber?

我们发生了亲密的关系
We engaged in intimate relations.

除了那一夜外还有很多次
That night and many others.

还有其他人能为你的话作证吗? 
Is there anyone else who can support your claim?

不久前她曾撞见我们在一起
She walked in on us once not long ago.

她看起来一点都不惊讶
She didn't seem surprised.

这证词是对一个大家族的侮辱
This testimony is an insult to a great house.

凭什么教廷或其他人要相信一个侍从的话 而不是高庭的继承人? 
Why should the Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?

他有个胎记 夫人
He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

在大腿根上
Quite high on his thigh.

酒红色 形状像多恩
Winecolored and roughly the shape of Dorne.

你们想怎么样? 让我们过去
What are you doing? Let us pass.

教廷确信已有足够证据 对洛拉斯爵士 及玛格丽王后 进行正式审判
The Faith is satisfied there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery.

在七神面前做伪证 同样是一项重罪 夫人
Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

你们不能这样对我 我是王后
You can't do this. I am the queen.

我是你的皇后 你竟敢犯上? 
I am your queen. How dare you?

别碰我!
Take your hands off me!

拉姆斯大人派我来为您梳洗 小姐
Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you a bath, my lady.

您要洗得白白净净 好迎接自己的丈夫 不是吗? 
You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband, don't you?

您真美 但您得学会取悦他
You're so beautiful, but you need to keep him happy.

拉姆斯很容易感到厌烦
Ramsay gets bored easily.

你不会想要变得… 呃 变得和其他人一样的
You don't want to end up like well, like the others.

哦 能看到原本的红发 真是太好了
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

用不着再躲躲藏藏
No point hiding anymore.

让我想想 有个叫凯菈的 铁匠的女儿
Let's see, there was Kyra the blacksmith's daughter.

她和你一般高 身材很好
She was tall like you,lovely figure.

可她不停地说啊说 说啊说 说得拉姆斯不耐烦了
But she talked and talked and talked and Ramsay grew tired of that.

还有芙蕾特
Then there was Violet.

她长着一头漂亮的金发
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

但她怀孕了
But she got pregnant.

然后呢 好吧 就招人厌了

Your mother's worried about you.

有人威胁我们要你的命
Threats have been made.

多恩对你来说太危险
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

我来带你回家 这儿就是我的家
I've come to take you home. This is my home.

好几年来 这儿都是我的家
This has been my home for years.

当初我并不想来 但她让我来
I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.

我履行了我的责任 现在她又要逼我回去? 
I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?

这是为了你好 事态太复杂了
It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.

不 一点儿也不复杂 很简单
No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple.

我爱崔斯丹 我要嫁给他 然后我们就呆在这里
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here.

我不明白 您当然不明白
I don't understand. Of course you don't.

兄弟啊 兄弟 我的末日临降
Brothers, O brothers, my days here are done

多恩人夺走了我的身子
The Dornishman's taken my life

没有关系
But what does it matter

我却尝过多恩人的妻子
And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

我却尝过多恩人的妻子
I have, I've tasted the Dornishman's wife.

他嗓子还不错
He's got a good voice.

算我们幸运 他是个歌手
We're lucky he's a singer.

如果他是个战士 我们大概就有麻烦了
If he were a fighter, we might have been in trouble.

伤害女人有违我的原则
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

太神奇了 不知多少个被我们打败的男人都有这个原则
It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.

我可没觉得你们打败了我
I wouldn't say you beat me.

如果离开多恩的时候身上没多个疤 那我浑身都会觉得不对劲
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.

你觉得你会离开多恩
You think you're leaving Dorne?

多恩女人是世上最美的女人
Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.

我说多恩女人 没说你
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

我难道不是你见过的最美的女人吗
I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?

七大王国里 我见过不少女人
I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.

说说 有哪一个比我更美
Name one more beautiful than I am.

嗯 在君临 有个天仙一样的…
Well, now, in King's Landing, there was an absolutely gorgeous...

你刚刚说 在君临
In King's Landing, you were saying?

你说有个女人比我更美
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

我不记得这么说过
My memory's not what it was earlier.

你很关心嘛
You seem concerned with it.

看来很钟意我咯
You must really like me.

你的脑袋呢? 
And how about your head?

你不会想知道我脑袋里在想什么...
You don't even want to know what's going on in

你的鼻子在流血
Your nose is bleeding.

没什么 空气太干燥了
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

我的匕首涂有一层亚夏的毒药
My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshai.

他们叫它漫长告别
They call it the Long Farewell.

起效的时间比较久 但只需在皮肤上沾上一滴 死
It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.

世上最美的女人是谁? 
Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?

我也觉得你长得很英俊
I think you're very handsome as well.

培提尔·贝里席
'小指头' 峡谷守护者

我很抱歉 挑了这么个地方 你才不抱歉
I'm sorry about the locale. No, you're not.

这里感觉上是最安全的地方
It felt like the safest place.

但显然对你的主顾们来说并非如此
Not for your clientele, clearly.

这跟其他地方不一样
It was an establishment like no other.

它是为了迎合欲望而生的
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

而如果我们不把它言明的话 欲望就不算存在
Desires that didn't even exist until we invented them.

你总是自我感觉相当良好 是不是
You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?

过去的就过去了
The past is the past.

未来才有讨论价值
The future is all that's worth discussing.

提利尔家族的未来
The future of House Tyrell.

别假惺惺的关心我的家族 或者我的孙辈还有我
Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren or me.

我早该想到 一旦事情变糟 你就会回到都城
I should have known you'd return to the capital as soon as things started to go wrong.

我向你保证 我向你保证 贝里席大人 我们的命运紧密相关
I promise youI promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined.

我们合谋杀死了国王
Together we murdered a king.

一旦我的家族倾覆 我就无需掩饰任何事情
If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide.

而一旦我在你这破烂妓院里 遭遇什么事故的话 你的尸骨将无人问津
And if I should meet with some accident here at your broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you.

所以 你对此有什么异议么
So...  do you deny a part in all this?

瑟曦召我到君临
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

我可不敢抗命
I dared not refuse her.

她想要什么
And what did she want?

一个消息 她清楚我有这个消息
A piece of information she knew that I had.

我既不能保持缄默 更不能说谎
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

不过我也有一些别的消息 对她来说就是意料之外了
But I have other information of which she is unaware.

正如您所说 我们的利益是一致的
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

我这里正好有一件礼物送给您
I have a gift for you.

跟我送给瑟曦的一样
The same kind I gave Cersei.

一个年轻的帅小伙儿
A handsome young man.

许多伟大的角斗士 倒在角斗大会的门边
Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games.

今天下午 你们这群无能废物里的大多数将走向死亡 这或许已经是你们人生中最光彩的一刻了
When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon, it will represent a significant rise in your station.

不过要是你们谁能够得胜的话 就能去达兹纳克大竞技场 在女王陛下前面战斗
But if you do happen to triumph here, you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen.

所以 不管发生了什么 众神今天已经在对你们微笑了
So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today.

今天起 你们的生命开始真正有了意义
This is the day your lives actually start to mean something.

Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.
Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.

看完最终的角斗大会必然糟糕透顶
Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.

历朝历代 在最终的角斗大会即将来临之际 在一些小的会场里四处巡视 并将君王驾临的荣耀赐予那里的角斗者 对于我们的统治者来说可谓惯例
For generations in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds of the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.

站直溜点儿 那可是他妈的女王
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

我等为您的荣誉而战 万死不辞
We fight and die for your glory,

我等为您的荣誉而战 万死不辞
We fight and die for your glory,

我觉得我看够了
I think I've seen enough.

陛下 这是传统 女王应当亲眼目睹胜利者的诞生
Your Grace, it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.

我为你们的传统已经牺牲得够多了
I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.

还没轮到你上场呢 你这烂渣
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.

不要让我看到他
Get him out of my sight.

我只占用您一点时间
I just need a moment of your time.

我为您带来了一件礼物
I brought you a gift.

很荣幸能见到您 陛下
It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.

我名叫提利昂·兰尼斯特
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

他们有给你足够的吃的么
Are they feeding you enough at least?

我给你带来了这个 鹿肉
I brought you this. Venison.

味道还不错哦
I had it myself for supper only last night.

从他们带走你哥哥之后我们便竭尽全力
We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother.

托曼甚至亲临圣堂 与大麻雀对峙
Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the High Sparrow.

但恐怕七神教会已然不问缘由了
But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.

我们已经为你尽了一切努力
We are making every effort on your behalf.

七神在上 我发誓
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

你的谎言来得太容易了
Lies come easily to you.

但是纯洁 正派 仁爱 恐怕你并不擅长这些
But innocence, decency, concern, you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

或许这就是为什么你的儿子如此渴望 为了我而疏远你
Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.

你脑子也不太清醒了
You're not thinking clearly.

当你冷静下来 我会再来探望的
I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.

我可不想再见到你了
I don't want to see you again.

我诚挚地期望看到你改主意
I do hope you change your mind about that.

我听说在红堡地下的黑牢里 人们往往会被逼疯
I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

不过我认为审判一旦开始 你的牢狱生涯就会结束
Though I suppose your isolation will end when your trial begins.

我的儿子现在比任何时候都更需要我
My son needs me now more than ever.

滚出去 你这个可憎的婊子
Get out, you hateful bitch!

然后?  她住的地方还算宽敞
And? Her accommodations seem sufficient.

接下来她会怎么样
What happens to her now?

唔 她和她哥哥 都有明确的嫌疑
Well, she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion.

我们将审判他们 并断定他们的某些行为 是否构成对七神信仰戒律的违背 进而获罪
A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they're guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith.

谁会主持审判呢
Who will stand judge?

七大主教 这在坦格里安王朝之前就是惯例了
Seven septons as it was in all trials before the Targaryens.

你会是其中之一么
Will you be one of them?

如果他俩中间有人 在审判之前忏悔的话
If one or both of them were to confess before the trial...

那么他们就会得到圣母的慈爱
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

圣母的慈爱意味着什么
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

这得看情况
It depends upon the situation.

得看他们到底做了什么 以及忏悔的程度
The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.

谢谢您 大主教 希望您能在七神注视之下 对他们的行为作出公正的判决
Thank you, High Septon, for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.

您可知道这座小教堂 是君临最古老的几座建筑之一么
Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?

我想我略有耳闻
I think I may have heard at one point.

圣贝勒在其之上建造了他的圣堂
Baelor built his sept around it.

但更早以前 人们就在这里祭拜七神了
But men worshipped here long before him.

这座圣坛是谁建造的
Who carved this altar?

您知道么?  恐怕不知道
Do you know? I'm afraid I don't.

这座祭坛上没有写着任何名字
There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel.

的确 建造这个地方的人们 并没打算向后人展示自己的虚荣 他们没有像圣贝勒那样留下一座镀金的畸形怪物
No, the people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on those who came after them the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

他们的信仰很纯净
Their faith was clean.

揭掉了金银和虚饰 拆除了雕像和石柱 而这留存下来的东西
Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains.

简单 牢固 而且真实
Something simple...  and solid and true.

提利尔们的矫饰将被揭去
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

他们的谎言将被拆穿
Their lies knocked down.

他们的真心将昭然于天下
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

而我等将得此教训
And so it will be for all of us.

如果把你的矫饰也揭开 我们会发现什么呢
What will we find when we strip away your finery?

不久之前 一个身心俱疲的年轻人
A young man came to us not long ago.

来找过我们
Broken in body and spirit.

他承受的太多 不堪重负
He had so much to strip away.

因而要把他们抛弃
So much weighing him down.

不过 最终他一点点的卸去了重担
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

抛弃了虚荣 傲慢 和罪恶
Let go of vanity, pride, sin.

现在他的灵魂十分轻灵 他将化作鸟雀飞向七重天
Now his soul is so light, he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird.

对于你 他有不少话想说
And he has much to say about you.

快点让我走
Let me go immediately.

快命令她让开我的路
You will order her to let me go.

我是太后 我可是太后
I am the queen! I am the queen!

你们疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?

把你们的脏手放远点儿
Get your filthy hands off me!

你们疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?

我是太后 放我走
I am the queen! Let me go!

这是你死前看到的最后一幅画面
It's the last thing you'll see before you die.

陛下 我想说的是
Your Grace, I want to say

我怎么确定你就是提利昂・兰尼斯特? 
How do I know you are who you say you are?

我还能是谁
If only I were otherwise.

如果你就是提利昂・兰尼斯特 我就应该杀了你 这是你的家族对我的家族的补偿
If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine?

你想向兰尼斯特家族复仇吗? 
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

我的妈妈乔安娜・兰尼斯特 因为生我而死
I killed my mother Joanna Lannister on the day I was born.

我用一把十字弓 杀了我爸爸泰温・兰尼斯特
I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart.

这个时代我是当仁不让的兰尼斯特克星
I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

那我是不是应该因为你杀了自己的家人 而把你招入我的麾下? 
So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?

提利昂・兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 被通缉的贵族

乔拉・莫尔蒙
'大熊' 被放逐的骑士

陛下 我们才刚刚见面
Your Grace, we have only just met.

还不能确定你是不是值得我为你效劳啊
It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.

你要是想回角斗场也行
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安 马上就送你回去
'风暴降生' 弥林的女王 just say the word.

我还年轻的时候 听到过一个故事 说在有史以来最恶劣的风暴中 有个婴儿降生
When I was a young man, I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory.

她没财产 没土地 没军队 只有一个高贵的姓氏和屈指可数的几名追随者 而且那些追随者大多是想用她的名号来捞上一笔
She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves.

她常有性命之虞 追随者带着她东躲西藏 往往前脚刚走 后脚来杀她的刺客就到了
They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

她最后被卖给了世界尽头的一个什么部落首领 故事到这里看起来差不多要结束了
She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that.

然而好些年过去了 世上最消息灵通的那个人告诉我 那个财产 土地 军队一无所有的女孩 没过多久便拥有了这三样东西 再加上三条龙
And then a few years later, the most wellinformed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time, along with three dragons.

那人说 她是当今最有机会 也是最后一个能改天换地的人
He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world.

我以为您至少值得一见
I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.

那你又为什么值得我一见? 
And why are you worth meeting?

我又为什么要花时间听你讲呢? 
Why should I spend my time listening to you?

因为您仅凭自己无法改天换地
Because you cannot build a better world on your own.

您身边没有人知道应该怎样统治维斯特洛
You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule.

各大家族的优势和弱点 他们是敌是友
The strengths and weaknesses of the houses that will either join or oppose you.

我将得到一支大军 还有身躯庞大的魔龙
I will have a very large army and very large dragons.

杀戮与政治不尽相同
Killing and politics aren't always the same thing.

我当国王之手的时候
When I served as Hand of the King,

国王醉心于虐待动物更甚于关心他的臣民 治国理政全凭我一人之力
I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people.

若您真能名副其实 我为一名称职的统治者出谋划策
I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.

还能表现得更好
If that is indeed what you are.

所以你想做我的顾问? 
So you want to advise me?

你认为我该如何处置他? 
What would you have me do with him?

我发过誓 他胆敢回来我就处死他
I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

女王言而无信 何以取信于人民呢? 
Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?

无论乔拉爵士在出卖您的消息时是何许人也 他已经痛改前非了
Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man.

我从没见过有人能像他侍奉您一样 那么忠心耿耿 至死不渝
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.

他说 他将为您而战 为您而死 我的所见所闻让我对他毫不怀疑
He claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him.

然而他的确背叛过您
And yet he did betray you.

他是否有过机会向您自首? 
Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?

没有 他是被逼之下不得不招认的
No, not until forced to do so.

我想他还爱上了您
He is in love with you, I think.

但他不相信您能接受那个事实
But he did not trust you with the truth.

那事实对您很重要 但无疑也令人不快
An unpleasant truth to be sure, but one of great significance to you.

他不相信 他说出口之后您能原谅他
He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.

那我应该杀了他? 
So I should kill him?

杀忠臣者 将无人为之效忠
A ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

而您需要人效忠 如果您要统治维斯特洛的话 还需要很多人的效忠
And you're going to need to inspire devotion, a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea.

然而您不能让他在您左右
But you cannot have him by your side when you do.

将乔拉爵士逐出弥林
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

我会看着你被处…
My face will be the last thing you see

我叫拉娜 是个孤儿
My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

我八岁的时候 讨到了足够的钱 买了第一篮牡蛎
When I was eight, I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters.

然后我卖了那篮牡蛎 挣到的钱再买了两篮
I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more.

过了一段时间 我攒够了钱 买了一辆手推车来卖牡蛎
It took a while, but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart.

每天早上我都会去运河边
I make my way down to the canals.

经过鱼贩和面包师的铺子
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

我通常会看见劳拉 她回家的时候会买我的牡蛎 每天都是第一个买
I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on her way home.

然后我左转进入月咏者巷…
Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane

左转进入旧货巷 我的大部分买卖都在那里做
Turn left onto Ragman Lane where I do most of my trade.

拉娜令人印象深刻
Lanna is very impressive.

她会成为千面之神的好仆人
She will make a fine servant for the ManyFaced God.

她将如何侍奉千面之神? 
How will she serve him?

她将不再左转去旧货巷
She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane.

她会右转 去旧货码头
She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

她要在那里做什么? 
What will she do there?

某人怎么会知道? 
How can a man tell a girl this?

如果某人知道女孩将会看到什么 女孩就不需要去了
If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝!
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝!
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝!
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

你不会骗老人家吧? 
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

很好 给我来四个 再加点醋
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

每次我都平安归来 毫发无伤
Returned from all of them without a scratch on me.

求你了 我有三个孩子
Please, I've three children.

这是钱 您拿着 求您了
Here, take it. You have to.

他们怎么办?  快走吧
What will they do? Come on.

他们只有我了
They've nothing without me.

求您了 你不了解!
Please, you don't understand!

这人是个赌徒
The man is a gambler.

他赌的是船 赌船只能不能平安到达目的地
He wages that a sailor's ship will make it to its destination.

对船长来说这个赌很奇特
It is a strange wager for the captain.

他们只有丢了性命才会赢得赌局
He only wins if he loses his life.

那为什么一开始船长要打这个赌呢
So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?

女孩告诉某人她见到的
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

如果船长死了 这个瘦瘦的人就会付给船长的家人很多钱
If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

可如果赌徒输掉了赌局 最后却决定不付钱
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides he does not have to pay after all.

如果他执意如此 那些无依无靠的女人和孩子又能怎么办呢? 
A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself?

她们能向谁求助? 
To whom can they turn for recourse?

你说过你不知道我在码头会看见什么
You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.

某人不知道女孩在码头会看见或看不见什么
A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not.

名叫拉娜的女孩会回到码头
A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.

她会继续观察这个赌徒
She will watch the gambler.

直到对他像对自己一样了如指掌
She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.

给这瘦瘦的人一个礼物
A gift for the thin man.

她可能还没准备好 也可能准备好了
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

对千面之神来说都一样
It is all the same to the ManyFaced God.

审判很快会举行
The trial will take place soon.

大麻雀会提出 大量针对您的指控
The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.

通奸 叛国 乱伦 谋害劳勃国王
Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.

当然 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

我担心的是教会并不像世俗王权那样 凡事讲求证据
My concern is that the Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown.

恕我直言 常常是教会想让谁死 谁就得死
I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.

我倒是希望你早点说出来
I wish you had said it sooner.

有詹姆的消息吗? 
Is there any word from Jaime?

陛下 派席尔大学士 已将您叔叔凯冯 从凯岩城召来 出任国王之手一职
Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King.

他现在主持御前会议
He now presides over the small council.

告诉他 我有话要跟他说
Tell him I need to speak to him.

我恳请他来看您 但是他不肯
I implored him to visit you, but he would not.

那我儿子呢? 国王呢? 
What about my son, the king?

如果你能来探视我 那国王必然也能…
If you can visit me, then surely the king...

您被监禁 玛格丽皇后也被监禁 国王还无法接受这一切
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken them well.

他把自己关在房间里
He remains in his chambers.

仆人们常常发现送去的食物丝毫未动
His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched.

你必须跟他说
You need to talk to him.

你必须告诉我儿子来见我 来见他的母亲
You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me, come and see his mother.

他…  我试过了 陛下
HeI tried, Your Grace.

他不见我 他谁都不见
He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone.

倒是有个办法 陛下
There is a way, Your Grace.

我亲手提拔的他
I rose him up from nothing.

我不会向某个光着脚的贱民下跪 乞求他的饶恕
I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.

我不是席恩 世上已没有席恩
I'm not Theon. There is no Theon.

你为什么要告诉他 臭佬? 
Why did you tell him, Reek?

你想要逃跑
You wanted to escape.

席恩・葛雷乔伊试图逃跑
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

主人追捕他 抓住了他 把他捆在十字架上 然后一片一片剥他的皮 直到再没有席恩这个人
He hunted him and caught him and strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.

要不是因为你 我也不会家破人亡
If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family.

如果我能像拉姆斯一样 此时此地 我一样会剥你的皮
If I could do what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.

我罪有应得
I deserved everything.

我活该成为臭佬
I deserve to be Reek.

我罪孽深重
I did terrible things.

杀死了那两个孩子 他们不只是'那两个孩子'
Killed those boys. They weren't 'those boys.'

他们是布兰和瑞肯 是你的弟弟
They were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers.

从他们出生开始你就认识他们
You've known them since they were born.

他们不是 他们只是…
They weren't. They were only

我不能说 除非主人允许
I can't, not unless the master says.

告诉我 他们不是什么?  他们不是―
Tell me. They weren't what? They weren't

告诉我为什么布兰和瑞肯就该死 而你却还活着
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone while you still breathe the air.

看着我的脸 席恩
Tell me to my face, Theon.

告诉我他们不是你的兄弟
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

他们不是布兰和瑞肯!
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

我找不到他们
I couldn't find them.

那只是两个农家男孩
It was two farm boys.

我杀了他们 烧了他们的尸体 这样就没人能看出来
I killed them and burned them so no one would know.

你知道他们去哪儿了吗 布兰和瑞肯? 
Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?

我不能再说了
I can't talk to you anymore.

席恩 你必须告诉我 你是否知道他们…
Theon, you have to tell me. Do you have any idea where

我们的斥候回报 他的兵力约有六千人
Our scouts tell us he's got no more than 6,000 men.

但一半以上都是骑兵
More than half of those are mounted, however.

那史坦尼斯的马能蹦多高? 
And how high do Stannis's horses jump?

我们的城墙已经全面整修过了
Our walls have been fully repaired.

城门也已加固
The gates have been reinforced.

我们的粮草足够支撑六个月
We have enough food for six months.

这场围城战我们比他们更有胜算
We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be.

我们要做的就是等他们冻死 饿死 哗变
All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

史坦尼斯不是北境人
Stannis isn't from the North.

我认为你错过了让人们好好瞧瞧的机会 瞧瞧北境 瞧瞧波顿家族 是如何惩罚南方入侵者的
I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

那你建议如何? 
And what do you recommend?

我们不应该在这干坐着 把战局的主动权拱手让给史坦尼斯
That we not sit and wait for Stannis to decide what sort of fight this is going to be.

我们应该先发制人 迎头痛击 让他们成为群鸦的盛宴
That we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows.

一个聪明的指挥官不会白白放弃防守优势
A smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage.

只要我们待在城墙后面 他们就伤不到我们分毫
As long as we stay behind these walls, they can't touch us.

更何况积雪这么深 即使我们想要与之一战 也无法派出军队
Not to mention that the snow is so deep, we couldn't get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to.

我不需要一支军队
I don't need an army.

那么 你想好了吗? 
So, have you decided yet?

我是否值得你效命? 
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

你想好是否要杀我了吗? 
Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?

杀你大概是最稳妥的选项
It's probably my safest option.

我明白你为何这么想
I can see why you would think so.

要是你父亲的话也会做同样的选择
It's what your father would have done.

那你父亲又会如何选择呢? 
And what would your father have done?

我父亲 那个当众判我死刑的父亲? 
My father, who publically sentenced me to death?

我敢说他一门心思要置我于死地
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.

你因此杀了他吗? 
Is that why you killed him?

等你哪天决定饶我性命
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

我就把杀死父亲的来龙去脉讲个清楚
I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.

而那一天 如果会有那一天的话 我还得多喝两杯
And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.

我知道我父亲是什么人
I know what my father was.

我知道'疯王'并非构陷之辞
I know the Mad King earned his name.

两个可怕父亲的两个可怕孩子
Two terrible children of two terrible fathers.

那你为何要跑到天涯海角来见这么个可怕的人? 
Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible?

来看看你是不是那种正确的可怕 那是哪一种? 
To see if you were the right kind of terrible. Which kind is that?

不让你的臣民变的更加可怕的那种
The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.

嗯 我确实重启了竞技场
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

在我的统治之下 谋杀再一次成为娱乐项目
Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment.

你还同意嫁给某个你特别厌恶的人
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good.

我姐姐也嫁给了个她十分厌恶的人 不过那并非她自己的选择 更非为了什么崇高目的 诸神在上
My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, gods forbid.

她最后把他杀了
She ended up having him killed.

但愿事不致此
Perhaps it won't come to that.

到头来 瓦里斯可能真的没有看错你
It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.

瓦里斯?  劳勃国王的情报大臣? 
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

没错 就是他说服我来投奔你的
Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you.

一路上我们二人同行 直到乔拉爵士把我抓住
He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

乔拉出卖我的情报给瓦里斯
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

二十年来八爪蜘蛛到处打探 要置我于死地
For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

他是为了生存而为之
He did what he had to do to survive.

他同时也做了很多其他的事 很多他没有必要做的事
He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do.

我猜正因为他的关系你才免于被杀死在襁褓之中
I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

他也许是我唯一信任的人
He may be the only person in the world I trust.

你那个杀死了我父亲的哥哥? 
The brother who killed my father?

或许我还该杀了你
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

身为女王你自然有这个权力
Your queenly prerogative.

我早就不想活喽 直到瓦里斯让我觉得您还算个盼头
I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for.

要是您砍了我脑袋 嗯嗯 我临死前那几天过得可就太有意思了
If you chop off my head, well, my final days were interesting.

我不打算杀你
I'm not going to kill you.

这么说来您既不杀我 也不驱逐我…
So if I'm not going to be murdered and I'm not going to be banished

你可以为我谏言
You're going to advise me.

前提是别醉得说胡话
While you can still speak in complete sentences.

如何得到我想要的
How to get what I want.

或许您该要点别的
Perhaps you should try wanting something else.

要想听笑话 我会找个称职的弄臣
If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.

那不光是句玩笑话
I'm not entirely joking.

世界很大 并非只有维斯特洛
There's more to the world than Westeros after all.

在这里您让多少人日子更好过了? 几百? 几千? 
How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here?

也许您就属于这里 在这能发挥最大的作用
Perhaps this is where you belong, where you can do the most good.

我希望奴隶湾出生的每个孩子 都不再体验被买来卖去是什么滋味
I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold.

无论身在何处 我都会继续为之奋斗
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

但我的故乡不在这
But this is not my home.

若重回故土 谁会支持您? 
When you get back to your home, who supports you?

那就姑且如此吧
Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen.

在奴隶湾 平民百姓是您的后盾 却也是唯一的后盾
Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people and only the common people.

这感觉如何? 撇开贵族进行统治? 
What was that like? Ruling without the rich?

坦格利安家族已经覆灭
House Targaryen is gone.

没一个活着的亲人能来支持您
Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you.

史塔克家族也完了
The Starks are gone as well.

拜咱们的两个糟糕老爹一手所赐
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

剩下的兰尼斯特 不会支持你 永远不会
The remaining members of House Lannister will never back you, not ever.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩也不会
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

他全靠抢您的位子 才有机会坐上铁王座
His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours.

那么就剩提利尔家族了
That leaves the Tyrells.

可能性存在 但也不够
Not impossible, not enough.

兰尼斯特 坦格利安 拜拉席恩 史塔克 提利尔
Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

他们无非是车轮上的辐条
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

轮流登顶
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

彼此倾轧 碾碎身下的尘埃
And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.

想停下车轮 这梦想挺美
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

可惜您不是头一个这么做梦的
You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.

我无意阻止它行进
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

我要粉碎这车轮本身
I'm going to break the wheel.

你说过 谁打赢了 就能在大角斗场为女王献艺
You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

你打了我 那就抽我几鞭子消消气
You struck me. Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

但你最出色的角斗士是我
But I'm the best you've got.

要是我在大角斗场赢了 你转手能卖上多少钱? 
If I win at the Great Pit, how much can you sell me for?

想去哪都行
You could have gone anywhere.

干嘛要回来? 
Why did you come back?

让我为她而战 我就归你了
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

你知道 我总有一天能出去
I'll get out of here, you realize, before long.

我能让你一夜暴富
I can make you a wealthy woman.

也能让你死得惨不忍睹
Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable.

我坐在这 满脑子想的 都是能干掉你的种种酷刑
And all I do is sit here imagining hideous ways for you to die.

山姆威尔・塔利
'杀手' 守夜人事务官

挨人揍还被踩脸的又不是我
I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.

你明白我在说什么
You know what I mean.

你害怕么? 有一点
Are you scared? A little.

我听说了你的事
I heard what happened.

男人嘛 时不时就得打一架 很正常
Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.

我猜你大概想吃点东西
Figured you were hungry.

啊 真是个好小子
Oh, you're a good lad.

如果方便的话 我想问你点事情
Wanted to ask you something if you've got the time.

我得去看一眼小山姆
I need to check on baby Sam.

那么 有什么能帮到你的么? 
Now then, how can I help?

关于司令大人的事情 嗯? 
It's about the Lord Commander. Yes?

他到艰难屯救野人去了
He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings.

野人杀了我父母
Wildlings killed my mom and dad.

还把我村子里的人杀光了
They killed everyone in my village.

我们和他们打了很多年
We've been fighting them for years.

我们只是农民 他们还下手屠杀
We were farmers and they slaughtered us.

所以这些家伙有什么好救的? 
So why is he saving them?

野人也是人
Wildlings are people.

和我们一样 有好 也有坏
Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones.

和他一起走的 红胡子的那个 带头屠村的就是他
The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.

奥利 司令怎么能相信他? 
Oh, Olly. How can he trust him?

我见过死人军团
I've seen the army of the dead.

见过异鬼
I've seen the white walkers.

它们的目标是我们 是世上所有生灵
And they're coming for us, for all the living.

到那时 每一个人的力量都是必须的
And when it's time, we'll need every last man we can find.

但要是野人进了长城 趁我们睡觉把我们全杀了 怎么办? 
But what if we let the wildlings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?

琼恩确实在冒险 但不得不这样
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.

别无选择
We don't stand a chance otherwise.

有时侯 人必须做出艰难的抉择 他人看来或许觉得有错 但当事人明白 长远地看 这个抉择是对的
Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.

别担心 奥利
Try not to worry, Olly.

我为琼恩操心好多年了
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

但他总会平安归来
He always comes back.

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人

你相信我么 琼恩・雪诺? 
You trust me, Jon Snow?

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人事务官

要说信的话会不会显得我在犯傻? 
Does that make me a fool?

现在咱俩都在犯傻喽
We're fools together now.

上回见面 小乌鸦还是你的囚犯
Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner.

现在倒过来了 咋回事? 
The other way around now. What happened?

打仗? 你管那叫打仗? 
War? You call that a war?

北境从未见过的大军 被个南方国王打得稀里哗啦
The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by some southern king.

咱们还是召集长者 找个安静的地方好好谈谈吧
We should gather the elders, find somewhere quiet to talk.

这里由不得你下命令
You don't give the orders here.

我也没下命令
I'm not giving an order.

你的镣铐呢? 
Why aren't you in chains?

他不是我的囚犯
He's not my prisoner.

跟乌鸦一伙了? 
You fight for the crows now?

我没和乌鸦一伙
I don't fight for the crows.

我们来这不是为了打架 是来谈判的
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

托蒙德 你和那俏乌鸦话挺多的嘛? 
You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?

等话说完了 是不是还要跪下来含他老二? 
And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock?

召集长者 咱们来谈谈
Gather the elders and let's talk.

是守夜人的总司令
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

过去从未当过朋友
We've never been friends.

今天更不会变成朋友
We won't become friends today.

我今天不谈友谊
This isn't about friendship.

只谈生存
This is about survival.

谈的是用 700 尺高的长城 将你我与那一侧的邪物隔开
This is about putting a 700foot wall between you and what's out there.

建长城把我们关在外面的是你们
You built that wall to keep us out.

什么时候起乌鸦倒关心起我们死活来了? 
Since when do the crows give two shits if we live?

平时当然不会 但当下可是非常时刻
In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times.

异鬼才不管对面的是自由民还是乌鸦
The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow.

对他们来说都一样 亡者大军的养料而已
We're all the same to them, meat for their army.

但若我们联手 便可击败他们
But together we can beat them.

还想击败异鬼? 
Beat the white walkers?

祝你好运喽 说不定还能逃掉
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

加入我们的人会得到这份礼物
It's a gift for those who join us.

一个守夜人的汉子曾用这种匕首 杀死一个异鬼
A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.

古老的传说里提到过这些龙晶
There are old stories about dragonglass.

传说里还有猎犬大小的冰蜘蛛呢
There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.

就我们的经历来说 你不相信? 
And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them?

跟我走 我会把这些武器分给你们
Come with me and I'll share these weapons.

长城以南土地丰饶
There are good lands south of the Wall.

守夜人会放你们穿过隧道 允许你们在那片土地耕耘生息
The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.

他从未真正想过同守夜人开战
He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.

只想为子民 为你们开辟新的生活
He wanted a new life for his people, for you.

而这正是我们准备带给你们的
We're prepared to give you that new life.

条件是你们得发誓在真正的战争打响之后加入我们
If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.

我一箭射穿他的心脏
I put an arrow through his heart.

嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

依我说 咱们剜掉司令官大人眼珠子 送他回黑城堡去
I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.

喂 你们都没看到曼斯是怎么死的
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

那个打垮我们军队的南方国王 史坦尼斯 想活活烧死曼斯 来吓唬我们
The southern king who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send us a message.

琼恩・雪诺没听那贱人的话
Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.

他的行为充满勇气
What he did took courage.

现在要的就是这个 有勇气放下恩怨 与世仇讲和
And that's what we need today, the courage to make peace with men we've been killing for generations.

我父亲 我叔叔 还有两个兄弟 都死在狗日的乌鸦手上
I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers fighting the damn crows.

我可没要求你们忘掉血债
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

我心里也有一笔血账
I'll never forget mine.

曼斯攻打长城那晚就有五十个弟兄牺牲了
I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall.

我只是请求你们 想一想自己的孩子
But I'm asking you to think about your children now.

要是我们不能联手 他们再没机会有自己的孩子了
They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together.

长夜将至 亡者紧随其后
The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it.

没有哪个部族能够阻挡它们的脚步
No clan can stop them.

自由民拦不住
The free folk can't stop them.

守夜人拦不住
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

南方国王们也拦不住
And all the southern kings can't stop them.

只有我们一起 所有人联手才行
Only together, all of us.

就算这样可能也不够 但好歹能战上一场
And even then it may not be enough, but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.

托蒙德 你要为这家伙担保么
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

这小子模样比我俩闺女都俊俏 但一身好武艺
He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight.

年轻是年轻 但懂得怎么领军
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

他本来没必要来艰难屯的
He didn't have to come to Hardhome.

但还是来了 因为他需要我们 而我们也需要他
He came because he needs us and we need him.

我的祖先要是知道我跟乌鸦联手 肯定会唾弃我
My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.

我的祖先也会 不过管那么多 他们早就死了
So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.

我永远不会相信黑衣佬
I'll never trust a man in black.

但我相信你 托蒙德
But I trust you, Tormund.

你说怎么办 我们听你的
If you say this is the way, we're with you.

留在这儿 就是死路一条
We stay here, we're dead men.

跟乌鸦大人走 至少还有机会活
At least with King Crow, there's a chance.

那些新生活的屁话留你自个得了
Keep that new life you want to give us.

那些龙晶也是 乌鸦大人
And keep your glass, King Crow.

你们一登上他的船 他们就会割掉你们的喉咙 然后把尸体丢进颤抖海
As soon as you get on his ships, they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

永远都是
That has always been our enemy.

瑟恩人真他妈讨嫌
I fucking hate Thenns.

快让他们往前挪 解开缆绳
Move 'em along, now. Castoff time.

跟我们南下的一共多少人? 有五千吗?
How many are with us? 5,000?

我不太擅长数数
I'm not good at counting.

很多人没一起来
We're leaving too many behind.

自由民们顽固得很
The free folk are stubborn.

你知道曼斯用了多久才把他们聚起来么? 
You know how long it took Mance to band them together?

况且他比我更了解这些人
And he knew them better than I ever will.

他们吃的快没了 猎物也快没了
They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt.

各就各位 是
Get yourselves ready. Aye!

乔娜会照看你
Johnna is gonna look after you.

她来负责 你得听话
She's in charge. You listen to her.

看好她 站稳了
Take her. There you are.

我要和你一起走
I want to go with you.

我得和那艘船上的老人们一起
I need to get the old folks on the boats.

我稍后就来 说话算话
I'm right behind you. I promise.

快点儿 我们到时候再会合
Keep moving. We'll meet you out there.

那东西不能上船 太大了
Won't be able to take that on the boat. It's too big.

最后一个 还有三个 快点儿
That's the last one!  Three more! Move on!

到处都还有龙晶没收拾
There's more dragonglass everywhere.

这也有龙晶
I've got some more daggers over here.

这把匕首收他包里
Put that dagger in his bag.

开门啊 放我们进去
Open the gate! Let us in!

停下 停下 排好队 都排队
Wait! Wait! Keep in line! Keep in line!

停下 停下 邓肯 维持秩序 队列别乱
Wait, wait! Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line!

把他们都弄上船再回来找我
Get them to the ship and come back for me!

但你可怎么 快去
But you'll never makeNow!

让我上船 让我上船
Let me on! Let me on!

快他妈让开 快出发
Bloody fucking move! Let go!

你应该上船的
You should be on one of those boats.

你不也是 我的丫头们已经上船了
So should you. My little girls got on.

要是你不在场 他们会让我们穿过长城么
They're gonna let them pass the Wall even if you're not there?

我说到做到 已经下过命令了
You have my word. I've given orders.

估计到时你也不会在场敦促他们
Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders.

要是它们攻破防线 大伙都得死
If they get through, everyone dies.

守夜人的汉子们 随我来
Night's Watch, with me!

托蒙德 拿雪橇过来 好的 好的
Tormund, the sleigh! Okay, okay!

别管什么狗屁龙晶了 命都要没啦!
Fuck the glass! We are gonna die here!

快点 快点 快跑 跑啊
Faster, faster!  Run, run!

快点 用力划 走啊 快点
Quickly, row! Row! Go, go, come on!

小心啊! 着火了! 着火了!
Look out! Fire! Fire!

大概二十个人 也许还不到这个数
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

就这么潜入撤出 无人察觉
They were in and out before anyone spotted them.

烧尽了我军的粮草 焚毁了我军的攻城武器
Burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons destroyed.

数十顶营帐被…  马呢? 
Dozens of tents wereHorses?

我们还在清点中 但死了有好几百匹
We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.

二十人骑马闯入我军营帐 卫兵都没有警示? 
20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?

北方佬一直比我们更了解他们的地盘
The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.

把昨晚的卫兵给我铐起来
Put last night's guards in chains.

他们要么就是贪睡偷懒玩忽职守 要么就是内奸通敌
Either they fell asleep or they conspired with the enemy.

查明真相后悉数绞死 陛下
Find out the truth and then hang them. Your Grace.

除非冰雪融化 不然我们无法向临冬城推进
Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell

戴佛斯·席渥斯 我们也没有足够的粮草撤退回黑城堡
'洋葱骑士' 史坦尼斯的首相 and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.

我们不会撤退回黑城堡
We're not returning to Castle Black.

恕我直言 陛下 我虽然打仗不在行 但如果我军没法前进 又不愿后退…
Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters, but if we can't march forward and we won't march back...

让人把死马剁了吃肉吧
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

托蒙德
'巨人克星' 野人

艾迪森·托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪'  守夜人事务官

山姆威尔·塔利
'杀手'   守夜人事务官

我本是去营救他们 结果却失败了
I went to save them. I failed.

全靠你 这些人才幸免于难
Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else.

我想他们可不会忘了这一点
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

你挺好心的嘛 琼恩·雪诺
You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

好到会把我们都害死
It'll get us all killed.

您召见我 陛下? 
You sent for me, Your Grace?

你去选几匹良驹 甄选骑士作为护卫
Find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you.

我要派你回黑城堡
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

传令给守夜人总司令 叫他运送粮草 补给 跟新饲养的马过来
Tell the Lord Commander his king commands him to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

作为回报 待我夺回铁王座
In return, when I take the throne,

定会保证守夜人如愿以偿 有足够的人力
I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires.

守卫长城边上的的十九座城堡
He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall if he so wishes.

陛下 您已任命我为国王之手
Your Grace, you named me your Hand.

国王之手应不离御前 尤其在战争时期
The King's Hand should never abandon the king, especially in time of war.

你这并非离弃君主 而是奉命行事
You're not abandoning me. You're obeying a command.

这个指令派个小男孩拿着卷轴就能传达
A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.

但倘若琼恩·雪诺拒绝来使 这个小男孩该如何应对? 
And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll, what does the boy say?

你被任命国王之手并非因为能征善战
I didn't name you Hand for your expertise in military matters.

策马前往黑城堡 别空着手回来
Ride for Castle Black. Don't come back emptyhanded.

陛下 或许赛丽丝王后 和席琳公主能与我同行
Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

我的家人与我同在
My family stays with me.

至少让我带走席琳公主
At least let me take Shireen.

小女孩在战场上太危险了
A siege is no place for a little girl.

我的家人与我同在
My family stays with me.

在看什么书?  由大学士慕昆撰写
What's this one now?  by Grand Maester Munkun.

听起来挺适合这个时候看的
Now that sounds like a proper story.

拜伦·史文爵士试图杀死巨龙瓦格哈尔. 
Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.

他用一周把盾牌打磨得光滑如镜
He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror.

他蹲伏在盾后 悄然前行 寄希望于巨龙只能看到自身的倒影
And he crouched behind it and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.

那头龙却看到了一个手持镜盾的蠢蛋
But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.

就把他烤成了肉卷
And burnt him to a crisp.

拜伦·史文爵士的屠龙冒险 到此为止了
Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann.

我做了东西给您 公主殿下
I made you something, Princess.

谢谢 乐意为您效劳
Thank you. You're very welcome.

您能再做个母鹿的给我吗? 这样他就能有个伴了
Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company?

但为什么要送我礼物? 
But why am I getting a present?

因为我本来就应向您道谢
Because you deserve it.

我儿子以前总是催我 想教我识字
My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read.

七神在上 我太顽固了不肯学
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

我到了现在的地位却不识字
Made it this far without reading.

本以为我可能到死前都不认字了
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

多希望我当初听了他的话
Wish I'd listened to him.

这是我唯一能向您表示感激的方法
This is my own poor way of saying thank you.

让我不再盲目无知
For teaching me to be a grownup.

我会离开几天 公主殿下
I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.

等我回来时 想听您给我讲《魔龙狂舞》的所有故事
I want to hear all about 'The Dance of Dragons' when I'm back.

您得自己读啦
You'll read it yourself.

不好意思 我们不等你来就先开动了
Forgive us. We started without you.

您不喜欢它?  你一定挺冷的吧
You don't like it? You must be cold.

完全没有 多恩的天气很适合我
Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.

您来多恩有何贵干? 
What are you doing in Dorne?

来确保我外甥女弥赛菈的安全
Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella.

不派渡鸦送信 也不直接给我报告 就这么直接潜入多恩领土 强行掳走我们的贵宾? 
And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly, you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force?

我们接到了恐吓信
We received a threatening message.

公主的项链放在蛇的颚上被送来
The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.

项链是从我的房里被偷走的
That necklace was stolen from my room.

斩首前最后的盛宴? 
A last meal before the beheading?

噢 我不能斩了你
Oh, I can't behead you.

众多多恩子民想要向铁王座宣战
Many in Dorne want war.

曾直视沙场上横尸遍野
I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields.

曾眼见孤儿挨饿濒死
I've seen the orphans starving in the cities.

我并不想把我的子民卷入这样的人间地狱
I don't want to lead my people into that hell.

你当然不想 你想与兰尼斯特家族同餐共饮
No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.

正是如此
And that is precisely what we are doing.

让我们举杯 敬托曼一世
Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name,

安达尔人和先民的国王
King of the Andals and the First Men,

七国统治者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

托曼陛下坚持 要他姐姐回君临吗? 
King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?

国王下令 我惟有听命
I cannot disobey my king's command.

她会随你回到君临
She will return with you to King's Landing.

还有崔斯丹王子陪伴左右
And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both.

若要确保铁王座和多恩的盟约不破 联姻必须维持
If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue, their engagement must stand.

还有一事 我弟弟在世时 在御前议会曾有一席之地
One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death.

令尊深知拉拢多恩 是多么重要
Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the fold.

死者已矣 崔斯丹应该接替奥柏伦进入御前议会
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.

弑君者的诺言
The word of a kingslayer.

怪不得你没法站起来 你压根儿没有脊梁
No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.

你是我四个侄女的母亲 我很爱他们
You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much.

因此我希望你的人生也长寿美满
For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life.

再敢这么跟我说话 你就不会拥有这样的人生
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

我能问问随我同来的波隆会有怎样的命运么? 
May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn?

告诉我 詹姆爵士 在君临 草民袭击王子该当何罪? 
Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?

他说那只是被跳蚤咬了一口
He said it was just a fleabite.

波隆只是个听命办事的马前卒罢了
Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders.

如果非要罚的话 就罚我吧
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

崔斯丹王子日后若要统御就该学会识人断事
Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day.

我从父亲那里学到了仁慈的可贵
I have learned the value of mercy from my father.

我给你的人自由 你心真善
I'll set your man free. You're a good man.

还玩什么呢? 我比你厉害
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

永远比你厉害
I'll always be better than you.

我有哪次打不中的? 
Have I ever missed once?

据我所知 一次都没有哦
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

你一定很喜欢被羞辱 要么就是喜欢疼
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

你更爱哪个 羞辱还是疼? 
Which do you love most, humiliation or pain?

那一下肯定很痛 对不对? 
That one hurt, didn't it?

放弃吧 小妹
Give up, little sister.

你马上就要打空了 我从不打空
You're going to miss. Oh, I never miss.

你会的 你想得太多了
You will. You're thinking too much.

现在你紧张了 她要是说对了怎么办? 
Now you're nervous. What if she's right?

运气罢了 现在轮到我了
Luck. Now it's my turn.

总是那么慢
You've always been too slow.

走了这一遭 我能如愿吗? 
Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk?

你很快就知道了
You'll find out very soon.

再说一遍 帅哥
Say it one more time, handsome.

世上最美的女子
The most beautiful woman in the world.

你说的一点没错
And that's the truth.

黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

我没听说过还有什么黑水河的爵士
I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater.

我想你早已见过崔斯丹王子
I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.

那天多有冒犯了
Sorry about the other day.

崔斯丹王子宅心仁厚
Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.

他同意赐你自由
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

但还有个条件
There was one condition.

还是喝点汤吧
Perhaps some soup instead.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇...
Oysters, clams, and cock

你的小蛤蜊卖几个钱啊? 
How much for your little clam?

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

作为铁银行的代表 我先行前来欢迎您 来到自由贸易城邦布拉佛斯
On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the Free City of Braavos.

希望您的旅途没有太多劳顿
I hope your journey was troublefree.

前两天碰上了点小麻烦
A bit of chop the last few days.

看到老伙计还镇守着港湾我就放心了
Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor.

河湾地的收成怎样? 
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

啊 酒商们说今年大概是 半个世纪以来红葡萄收成最好的一年了
Ah, the vintners say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century.

如果我们能达成协议
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

我一定送上一桶青亭岛最好的佳酿
I'll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

恐怕我得谢绝
I'm afraid I don't partake.

有人说高利贷生意沾满铜臭 下流不誉
Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable.

当然是一派胡言
Pure nonsense, of course.

很高兴我们看法一致
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

你知道吗? 梅葛三世曾一度 想在七国全境立法禁止高利贷
Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

还想逮捕借贷谋利的人 砍掉他们的双手
Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.

手套商们可要冤死了
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

要是谁借款不收利息 那么他的账上只会有出无进 谁会冒这险? 
If a man charges no interest on a loan, then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why chance it?

而正是付息的承诺 让人愿意放手一赌
Whereas the promise of reward makes a man willing to gamble.

提利尔公爵 我们铁银行可不是赌徒
We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

你们是这世上最厉害的赌徒
You are the world's best gamblers.

你们赢下的每一注最终造就了这个
And all those bets you won built this.

恐怕我还有诸多要事在身
I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.

噢 算了吧 别管工作了 你会唱歌吗? 
Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?

我没有那一项天赋 那可不是什么天赋
I don't have that gift. Oh, it's not a gift.

那是技能 大家都能学会的
It's a skill. Anyone can learn it.

这老东西好像永远不知道闭嘴似的
Thought that old shit would never stop singing.

提利尔家的人都可以在地狱里腐烂发臭了
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

他们原本还要让那个基佬蓝礼当国王呢
They were going to make that boyfucker Renly king.

就是这儿了 小子们
This is the place, lads.

布拉佛斯最漂亮的貂皮
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

你要买吗?  哦 我当然要买
You buying? Oh, I'm buying.

但我从来不擅长和人分享
But I never was good at sharing.

到别处卖你的鱼去
Sell your fish somewhere else.

噢 让她进来 布鲁斯科 我饿死了
Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

到这儿来 小甜心
Come here, sweetness.

人们都说牡蛎能让人汁水横流呢
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

我们买半打
We'll take half a dozen.

就冲小姐喜欢你这点 给你一枚银币
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

我有最佳人选了 安娜拉
I have just the one. Anara.

我们这里最贵的小姐了
Our most expensive girl.

但绝对值了 我向你保证
But well worth it, I assure you.

你到底有没有我想要的? 
Do you have what I want or not?

当然 当然
Of course. Of course.

来吧 伙计们都饿坏了
Come on, the lads are hungry.

牡蛎用来壮阳再好不过了
Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters.

给 谢谢你  我要一个
Here. Thank you. I'll have one.

谁让这女孩儿进来的? 去! 去!
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

等我们完事我会通知你
I'll tell you when we're done.

明天你还有新的吗? 
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

再不走我就打你了 小姑娘
I'll have you whipped, girl.

走 走开 去 出去
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

那个瘦男人今天不饿
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

或许这就是为啥某人那么瘦
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

女孩还有事要做
A girl has work to do.

你的叛乱结束了
Your rebellion is over.

你现在可以向我宣誓效忠… 也可以选择去死
You can swear your allegiance to me now...  or you can die.

我相信人能改过
I believe in second chances.

但事不过三
I don't believe in third chances.

你写东西像七岁小孩
You write like a sevenyearold.

你们的学士非常乐意为我抄一份
Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.

他没要你钱? 
He didn't try to make you pay?

皇后陛下得知你想带她的女儿回家定会十分激动
The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home.

你非常爱她 不是么? 
You love her very much, don't you?

当然 他可是我外甥女
Of course, she's my niece.

我不是说她
I wasn't talking about her.

你觉得我会反对吗? 
You think I disapprove?

就因为你们那儿的人都会反对你那档子事儿吗? 
Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from?

他们会反对的是奥伯伦和我
They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from.

这里的人才不会管这些
Here no one blinked an eye.

一百年前 如果你姓坦格利安 没人会正眼瞧你
100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you'd been named Targaryen.

我们应该去爱谁 我们不该去爱谁 总是在变
It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.

而唯一不变的 是我们究竟爱着谁
The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.

我知道发生在我所深爱的男人身上的可怕事情 和你女儿毫无关系
I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I love.

或许这件事上连你都是无辜的
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

不冷 你在读什么? 
No. What are you reading?

'魔龙狂舞 ' 讲什么的? 
'The Dance of Dragons.' What's it about?

讲的是发生在雷妮拉·坦格利安 和他同父异母的弟弟伊耿之间为争夺七大王国控制权的战争
It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her halfbrother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.

他们都认为铁王座属于自己
Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne.

当人们开始宣誓效忠其中的一方或另一方时 他们的战争将七大王国一分为二
When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

同胞相残 魔龙狂舞
Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.

当这一切结束的时候 几千人人死于非命
By the time it was over, thousands were dead.

而这对坦格利安家族来说同样是一场灾难
And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well.

他们从未真正恢复元气
They never truly recovered.

人们就是这么叫的
It's just what they call it.

嗯 这不太合情理
Hmm, doesn't make much sense.

如果你一定要在雷妮拉 和伊耿之间做出选择 你会选择谁? 
If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon...  who would you have chosen?

我两边都不选
I wouldn't have chosen either.

就是选边站队才让事情发展得如此可怕
It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.

有时一个人必须做出选择
Sometimes a person has to choose.

有时整个世界逼迫他做出选择
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

如果这个人知道自己是谁...  并听从自己的内心...  那么对他而言就根本不存在什么选择
If a man knows what he is...  and remains true to himself...  the choice is no choice at all.

他必须完成他的使命… 并成为他注定要成为的人
He must fulfill his destiny...  and become who he is meant to be.

不管他对此有多痛恨
However much he may hate it.

没事的 父亲
It's all right, Father.

你根本不知道我在说什么
You don't even know what I 'm talking about.

我有没有帮助你的方法? 
Is there any way I can help?

我是拜拉席恩家族的公主席琳
I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

我是你的女儿
And I'm your daughter.

我父亲在哪里? 我要见我父亲
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

一切都会很快过去的 公主殿下
It will all be over soon, Princess.

你不能这样做 父亲 您在哪儿? 
No, you can't do this. Father, where are you?

让我见见他 求您了
Please, let me see my father.

父亲 您在哪儿? 快阻止她
Father, where are you? Don't let her do this.

我要见我的父亲! 您在哪里? 求求您!
Let me see my father! Where are you? Please!

这就是光之王想要的 别这样
It's what the Lord wants. No.

求求您 放开我! 别这样! 这是一件善举
Please! Let go! No! It's a good thing.

伟大之举 停下来 停下来!
A great thing.  Stop. Stop!

求您了! 光之王 倾听吾等
Please! Hear us now, my Lord.

你不能这样做! 我们为您献上这名女孩
You can't do this! For you, we offer up this girl

求您了! 请您用火焰净化她 使其光芒为我们指引道路
Please! ...that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.

求求您别这样 让我见见我的父亲
Please! No, please let me see my father.

如果不这样做 我们都会饿死在这里
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.

但是一旦我们进行了这次献祭…
But if we make this sacrifice...

光之王 请您接受我们的奉献 引领我们走出黑暗
Accept this token of our faith, my Lord, and lead us from the darkness.

光之王 请您为我们指明道路 母亲!
Lord of Light, show us the way. Mother!

母亲 求求您 母亲!
Mother, please! Mother!

没有别的办法 她身上流着国王之血 求您别这样做!
There's no other way. She has king's blood. Please don't do this!

光之王 保护吾等
Lord of Light, protect us.

求求您 父亲 求求您! 因为长夜漫漫 处处险恶
Please! Father, please! For the night is dark and full of terrors.

父亲 别这样 求您了!
Father, don't do this! Please!

母亲 求求您 求求您 救救我!
Mother, no! Please! Please, help!

求求您们 父亲 母亲 救命!
Please, Father! Mother, help!

不要 别这样 求求您!
No. No, please! Don't do this!

别这样 母亲 求您了!
Don't do this, please, Mother!

母亲 求求您 母亲 救命!
Please, Mother! Mother, help!

求您别这么做 母亲!
Please don't do this, Mother!

求求您 母亲 求求您!
Please, Mother! Please!

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 弥林的女王

我只是去确保一切都井然有序
Just making sure everything is in order.

他们在等您
They're waiting for you.

那边那个 小个子的家伙
That one, the smaller man.

毫无疑问你们应该下注赌他赢
No question, that's where you should put your money.

这儿可就有个小个子呢
The smaller man it is.

我没打算下注赌任何人赢
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

国王和王后从不参与角斗的下注
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

或许你应该去找个会赌的人说
Perhaps you should go find someone who does.

当我还在角斗场竞技的时候 人们总会赌我输
People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.

他肯定也会这样做 常见的新手错误
He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.

我在这竞技场里待得够久了
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

在我的经验里 大块头战胜小个子 可比相反的状况要常见得多
And in my experience, large men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not.

你的经验包含了任何实战经历吗? 
Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting?

你尝试过与另一个人生死相搏吗? 
Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you?

每当我在竞技场里遇上像这种野兽的时候
Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one,

提利昂·兰尼斯特 观众们看到那时还皮包骨头的我 然后又看到那一坨打算干掉我的愤怒的肌肉
'小恶魔'  丹妮的顾问 the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me.

全都争先恐后地一股脑下注去了
They couldn't get their money out fast enough.

但是那坨肌肉往往在这里 或者… 这里是没有肉的
But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or... here.

而且他们往往都太慢了 来不及阻止我的匕首刺进他们没有肉的地方
And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't.

没错 只要我看到站在我对面的是这样一头 摆着恐怖表情的野兽 我就知道我可以回去好好休息了
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.

以我的标准来看 我见证过的死亡实在是有点多过头了
There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.

我希望在闲暇时间里能少见证一些
I can do without it in my leisure time.

有道理 尽管这是一个不太令人愉快的问题 但哪一项伟大的成就不是伴随着残忍和杀戮而达成的呢? 
Fair enough. Yet it's an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?

'是什么'和'应该是什么'总是容易混淆 特别是当这种混淆对你的观点有利的时候
It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor.

我所说的和我自己无关
I'm not talking about myself.

我在讨论的是成就伟大的必要条件
I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.

那是弥林这座伟大的城市中至关重要的一部分 在你我诞生之前它就早已存在 而在我们化归尘土后仍会屹立不倒
That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

我父亲肯定会喜欢你
My father would have liked you.

有朝一日 你那伟大的城市也会化归尘土的
One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

在你的命令之下?  如果有这个必要的话
At your command? If need be.

如果这事发生 又有多少人会死呢? 
And how many people will die to make this happen?

如果事情真的发展至此 他们至少算是死得其所
If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

那些人都认为他们自己死得其所
Those men think they're dying for a good reason.

他们得的是其他人的所
Someone else's reason.

所以您的理由是正确的 而他们的是错误的? 
So your reasons are true and theirs are false?

他们并不像您了解他们一样了解自己? 
They don't know their own minds, but you do?

说得好 你狡辩的本事不错
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

这并不代表你说得不对
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

根据我的经验 会狡辩的人和蠢货一样 都是分寸不让 永远正确的呢
In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
'大熊' 被放逐的骑士

陛下…  住嘴
Your GraceShut your mouth.

你可以终止比赛 她不能
You can end this. She cannot.

陛下! 陛下!
Your Grace! Your Grace!

跟我来 我知道一条出去的路
Come with me. I know a way out.

国王陛下 光之王实现了他的诺言
The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king.

他的火焰将积雪融化
His fires have melted the snows away.

前方的障碍已经扫清
The way ahead is clear.

我们将奔袭临冬城
We ride for Winterfell.

而你将赢得战斗
And you will take it.

光之王让我看见波顿家的旗帜在燃烧
The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning.

您会得到您理应得到的
You will receive what is yours by right.

好多人在天亮以前逃跑了
The men, many deserted before dawn.

雇佣兵都逃了 还带走了所有的马
All the sellswords with all the horses.

说吧 总不见得能比兵变更糟
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

刚刚有人看到梅丽珊卓女士骑马从营地里面出去了
The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

让剩下的人列成行军队列
Get the men into marching formation.

他举起双手 他们就全都站了起来
He raised his hands and they all stood up at once.

这些怪物是全世界最庞大的军队 成千上万 无穷无尽
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

所以你打算怎么办? 
So what are you gonna do?

山姆威尔·塔利
'杀手'  守夜人事务官

我只能祈祷他们不知道怎么爬上长城
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

我们不是有龙晶…
But the dragonglass...

没人能把它们带回来
No one's ever getting that back now.

而且这无济于事
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

除非我们有一座山那么多的龙晶
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

但是你杀了一只异鬼
But you killed a white walker.

我看见他们击碎钢斧就像打碎玻璃一样
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

但长爪…  是瓦雷利亚钢做的
But Longclaw... Is Valyrian steel.

七大王国还剩下多少把瓦雷利亚钢剑
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

我大概是历史上首任 为了保护野人 而牺牲兄弟们的司令官了
The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings.

跟黑城堡里面最被人讨厌的人交朋友是什么感觉
How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

我一到这儿你就是我的朋友了
You were friends with me when I first came here.

那时候我也不见得讨人喜欢
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

我想求你件事
I wanted to ask you something.

求你下一道命令
To ask something of you.

命我 吉莉 还有孩子前往旧镇 然后我可以去学着成为一个学士
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a maester.

那才是我该做的 而不是像现在这样
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

山姆 我需要你留下
I need you here, Sam.

如果你走了 我还能信任谁的建议呢
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

何况如果我能成为学士 对你的帮助更大
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

也能接替去世了的伊蒙学士 帮助大家
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

学城有着这个世界上最大的图书馆
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

我将在那里学习历史 战术 医术
I'll learn about history, strategy, healing.

还有其他各种知识 异鬼们兵临城下的时候 这些知识会有用的
And other things, things that will help when when they come.

如果吉莉留在这里 她必死无疑
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

那个以我为名的孩子也会死
And the baby that she named after me will die.

而我会为了保护她们 也一样死去
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

这意味着 我死前看到的最后画面 是她失望的眼神
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

相比之下 我宁愿看见成千上万的异鬼
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

你要知道 在学城 你也需要发誓不碰女人的
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

得了吧 让他们试试
Oh, they'll bloody try.

你不是才被打了个半死么 你是怎么...
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you

我很欣慰 在这世界的尽头 还是有人过得不错啊
I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的大军攻过来了
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

你怎么知道是史坦尼斯
How do you know it's Stannis?

他们拿的是烈焰红心旗
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

我在黑水河之战见过 永生难忘
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

离城墙三百尺的地方再挖一道
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

好的 克鲁 我在这儿
Right, Curlew. Yes, sir.

在这两个坡地之间挖一道战壕
Dig between those two rises.

分散队形 我跟你一起
Spread out. I'm with you.

快点派征粮队出去
And send out a foraging party immediately.

日出时正式围城
Siege begins at sunrise.

不会有围城战了 陛下
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

原来还有女人给波顿卖命
Bolton has women fighting for him?

我并不为波顿作战
I don't fight for the Boltons.

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

蓝礼·拜拉席恩的御林铁卫
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

他被刺杀的那天晚上 我看到了个跟你长得一样的影子
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

你用了血魔法谋害了他? 
You murdered him with blood magic?

以安达尔人, 先民的正统国王
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,

七国的统治者 暨全境守护者
First of His Name, rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

拜拉席恩家族的蓝礼一世之名
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,

我 塔斯的布蕾妮 在此宣判你死刑
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

你有何遗言么
Do you have any last words?

看来已经结束了
Looks like we're done here.

我投降 我投降
I surrender! I surrender!

我奉命送您回您的闺房
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

我知道拉姆斯是什么东西
I know what Ramsay is.

我知道他接下来要对我干什么
I know what he'll do to me.

就算我必须死 至少我现在还死得像个人
If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's still some of me left.

有人说过您要死么
Who said anything about dying?

您的父亲可是北境守护
Your father was Warden of the North.

虽然我觉得他大概不需要一个完整的您
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

只需要您能为他生下继承人的那个部分 您给他生下一两个男孩以后 就完全没用了
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir, until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

那时候他大概会有些别的好计划吧
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

所以 我们要等他回来呢 还是现在直接开始
So, shall we wait for him to come back or should we begin now?

您让我自己选择吗
You're leaving it to me?

看来有合适的人选了
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

你在我名单首位 知道么
You were the first person on my list, you know.

因为你杀了西利欧·佛瑞尔 记得他么? 
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

我还有其他人要杀
I've gotten a few of the others.

但千面之神从我这里偷走了他们
The ManyFaced God stole a few more from me.

不过好在它留下了你
But I'm glad he left me you.

知道我是谁么? 
Do you know who I am?

知道你是谁么? 
Do you know who you are?

女孩拿走了一条命
A girl has taken a life.

我说对了
I was right about her.

那个人的生命不归你取
That man's life was not yours to take.

女孩从千面之神那里偷走了一条命
A girl stole from the ManyFaced God.

唯有死亡能偿还生命
Only death can pay for life.

不, 你… 你不能死! 不能死!

不 他不是 你为什么不听他话? 
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

但如果你… 这又是谁? 
But if you're who's this?

正如从大厅里偷走脸庞的女孩本该成为的
Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.

这些脸属于无名之辈
The faces are for no one.

而你仍是有名之辈
You are still someone.

对有名之辈来说 这些脸是毒药
And to someone, the faces are as good as poison.

祝您一路顺风 谢谢
I wish you a safe journey home. Thank you.

愿世间所有快乐与您相伴

或许什么时候我会来看你

就等你了 大人
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

这次别再弄丢了
Try not to lose it this time.

我绝不会再摘下它
I'll never take it off again.

我知道你不想离开多恩 但你回家挺好
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne, but I'm glad you're coming home.

你母亲特别想见你
Your mother's desperate to see you.

崔斯丹和我们一起走挺好
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

他看着是个好小伙
He seems like a nice boy.

政治婚姻的结果很少会如此… 不政治
Arranged marriages are rarely so so well arranged.

您觉得母亲会喜欢他么? 
Do you think Mother will like him?

如果她看到你开心 我想她会喜欢的
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

您真这么想? 
You really believe that?

除了她孩子 你母亲什么时候喜欢过别人? 
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?

这我可不好说
I'm not so sure about that.

听着… 有些事情我想告诉你
Listen...  there's something I wanted to tell you.

有些我早就该和你说的事情
Something I should have told you long ago.

所以… 既然你见过世面了 你应该能明白 事情会很复杂 人也是
So...  now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be, people can be.

兰尼斯特家族和马泰尔家族是世仇 但你和崔斯丹相爱了
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

这很意外 真的 我的意思是 这种事情发生的几率多大? 
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

你爱上了 你被指定要嫁的未婚夫? 
You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry?

我的意思是… 我们无法选择会爱上谁
My point is...  we don't choose whom we love.

这只是 额… 不是我们能控制的
It just, well it's beyond our control.

我听上去就是个傻瓜 不 您不是
I sound like an idiot. No, you don't.

我想说的是 想说的是… 该怎么说…
What I'm trying to saywhat I'm trying and failing to say

我知道您想说什么
I know what you're trying to say.

不 你不知道
No, I'm afraid you don't.

关于您和母亲
About you and Mother.

我想我早就知道
I think a part of me always knew.

您是我父亲 我很开心

But we always want the wrong woman.

他话一直这么多? 
Does he always talk so much?

他不应该在这
He should not be here.

女王放逐了他
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

要不是他 女王早死了
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

我没在那里为女王而战
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

你错过了一架
You missed a good scrap.

但没关系了
None of that matters now.

我们在这里说多久 丹妮莉斯就要在荒野里多呆多久
The longer we sit here bantering, the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

他说得对 龙往北边飞了
He's right. The dragon headed north.

如果要去找她 我们得往那走
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

女王意欲剥夺你们家族的权力
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

而我准备帮她这么干
And I intend to help her do it.

你才来几天? 
You've been here for how many days now?

我为她战斗了好几年
I've fought for her for years.

那时她还是个半大的小姑娘
Since she was little more than a child.

你背叛了她 注意言辞
You betrayed her. Careful now.

然后她放逐了你 没记错的话 还放逐了两次
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

第二次还不是你害的
The second time thanks to you.

别拿你自己的罪过责怪我 莫尔蒙
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

他没错 女王放逐了乔拉
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

他也没错 乔拉救了女王一命
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

那或许她现在对他的感觉有所改变
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

又或许没有 只有问问她才知道
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

行 行 我想他现在可以加入我们了
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

只要他保证不会夜里割了我喉咙就行
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

我要杀你也是正大光明地杀
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

不好意思 只不过 我们为什么要带上你呢? 
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

你在野外追踪过动物吗?

I don't claim to be a great warrior.

你的马术好吗? 
Are you good on a horse?

我也酗酒  但是我也活了这么长啊
And drink. I've survived so far.

这倒让人钦佩 但你对这次搜寻没什么帮助
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

不过你可以留在弥林发挥作用
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

我们之中没人管理过一座城市 除了这位
None of us have experience governing a city except for him.

你不是想向女王证明自己的价值吗? 
You want to prove your value to the queen?

在弥林城证明吧
Prove it right here in Meereen.

他是个异域侏儒 而且还说不好本地的语言
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

弥林人凭什么要听他的? 
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

但是灰虫子会让他们听话
They will listen to Grey Worm.

你不能乱跑 你还没有恢复好呢  我恢复好了
You are not strong enough to go anywhere. I am.

他恢复了 他是我见过的没有卵蛋的人里最有种的
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

但是你还是不能一起去
But you still can't go.

自由民相信你
The people believe in you.

他们知道你可以代表女王
They know you speak for the queen.

只有无垢者才能维持城内秩序
Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

如果你走了的话 城里一半的人会群起而杀掉另一半
If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.

女王陛下最相信的人就是弥桑黛
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

一个是女王最亲密的知心人 一个是无垢者的统帅 还有个外国侏儒 脸上有道疤
The queen's closest confidante, the commander of the Unsullied, and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

祝你们好运 我的朋友们
Good fortune, my friends.

Meereen is ancient and glorious.

看来就是我俩了 安达尔人乔拉
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

走 咱们去找两匹好马
Let's find some good horses.

这一路可有的聊了
We have so much to talk about.

在你离我而去之前 我认为我们结伴的旅途还是很愉快的啊
I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.

我就不问你是怎么找到我的了
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

小小鸟或鸣在西 小小鸟或鸣在东 全看人们是不是会聆听
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east, if one knows how to listen.

他们告诉我你已经获得了 龙之母的赏识
They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.

至少她没砍掉我的头 这是个好的开头
Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start.

而现在英雄去救美了 我却不能离开这里 还要尽力安抚一个处在内战边缘的城市
Now the heroes are off to find her and I'm stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

老战友有何建议啊? 
Any advice for an old comrade?

情报是关键
Information is the key.

你要弄清楚敌人的势力和策略
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

还要学会区分出你所谓的'朋友'中的敌人
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

要是我认识一个情报网密布的朋友就好咯
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

一座伟大的古城 充斥了暴力 腐败和阴谋
A grand old city choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

但谁又有经验去驯服这一个 庞大而笨拙的野兽呢? 
Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 弥林的女王

哦 我可怜的小东西啊

载我回弥林吧? 
Can you take me back to Meereen?

你带我飞了多远? 
How far did you carry me?

卓耿 我们得回去
Drogon, we need to return.

没有吃的
Well, there's no food.

最起码 你可以给我们捉些猎物当晚饭
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

我怎么会一直都如此盲目呢? 
How can I have been so blind for so long?

我想洗净我的罪恶

他的罪抵消不了你的罪行
His sins do not pardon your own.

七神宽恕我
May the gods forgive me.

在七神面前说谎是极大的罪恶
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

有人说你的孩子们 不是你和劳勃国王所生 而是通奸和乱伦产下的私生子
There are those that say your children were not fathered by King Robert, that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

这是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的谎言
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

他图谋篡位 但是他兄长的嫡子挡了他的路
He wants the throne, but his brother's children stand in his way.

所以他才编造谎言说孩子不是他兄长的
So he claims they are not his brother's.

这里面没有一丝一毫的真实可言
There is not one shred of truth to it.

但这些是骇人听闻的指控
But these are terrible charges.

七大王国的人民必须知道真相
And the realm must know the truth of them.

陛下若是做了诚实的证词 审判便会还您清白
If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.

审判?  我已经认罪了
Trial? I have confessed.

其余的你否认掉了
Others you have denied.

对您的审判将剥离谎言与真相
Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

谨遵总主教大人的英明见解
I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.

但如果可以恳求 圣母一丝的怜悯
But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.

我求求您让我见见儿子

求求您了 我想见他
I need to see him, please.

她承认犯下欺骗 以及通奸的大罪

是谁帮助了你? 史坦尼斯
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

戴佛斯·席渥斯
'洋葱骑士' 史坦尼斯的首相

我已经告诉过他 你救了他们该死的性命
I told him before. You saved their bloody lives.

如果他们还想居住在七国的土地上 安全地躲在我们的长城背后 他们就得为这个地方战斗!
If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.

他们不属于这场战斗 打开大门!
It's not their fight. Open the gates!

席琳呢? 公主在哪儿?

您带回来的一名野人
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.

说他认识您的叔叔班扬

你确定他指的是班扬? 
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

他说那个人是首席游骑兵
Said he was First Ranger.

他知道在哪儿能找到他
Said he knows where to find him.

那个男人声称在艰难屯见到过你叔叔 在上一次满月的时候
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome at the last full moon.

他可能在撒谎 可能是

有办法查明白
There are ways to find out.

还有波文·马尔锡和奥赛尔·亚威克 以及这座城堡里的其他军官

我们都是叛徒
We've committed treason, all of us.

琼恩·雪诺是我的总司令

我对他没什么好感
I had no love for him.

但我从未违抗过命令
But I never once disobeyed an order.

忠诚 是守夜人的基石
Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night's Watch is built.

守夜人就是我的一切

我献出了生命 我们都向守夜人军团献出了自己的生命
I have given my life, we have all given our lives  to the Night's Watch.

琼恩·雪诺准备毁了守夜人军团
Jon Snow was going to  destroy the Night's Watch.

他让野人通过我们的大门 之前从来没有总司令这么干过
He let the wildlings  through our gates as no Lord Commander  has ever done before.

反倒把那些饱受他们摧残的土地 给予了他们
He gave them the very land  on which they reaved and raped and murdered.

雪诺总司令做了他认为对的事情
Lord Commander Snow did  what he thought was right,

对此我不怀疑
I've no doubt about that.

他认为对的事情可能会害死我们
And what he thought was right  would have been the end of us.

是他逼我们做出这个糟糕的决定
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

他知道我们没有去
He'll have seen we didn't come.

我认识雪诺总司令的时间不长 但我相信他不会让朋友们白白送命
I didn't know Lord  Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn't have  wanted his friends to die for nothing.

如果你想活到明天 你就来错地方了
If you were planning to see tomorrow,  you picked the wrong room.

要死 也拉着索恩垫背

只要有人帮我们谁会帮我们? 
Not if we have help.  Who is gonna help us?

不是只有你们欠琼恩·雪诺一条命
You're not the only ones who  owe your lives to Jon Snow.

我会尽快回来

狗舍总管的女儿
The kennelmaster's daughter.

我比她大不了多少 但大家都已经很怕我了
I wasn't much older, but everybody  was already afraid of me.

但米兰达却不怕
Myranda wasn't, though.

我能对她做的事比那些猎狗能好多少? 
What could I do to her  that those hounds couldn't?

没有她做不了的事
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

你所受的痛苦将会千倍偿还
Your pain will be paid for  a thousand times over.

我真希望你能亲眼看到
I wish you could be here to watch.

大人 要为她掘一座坟吗? 
Shall I have a  grave dug for her, my lord?

还是让人为她堆起一座柴火堆? 
Or would you rather  the men build a pyre?

拿去喂狗
Feed it to the hounds.

你对骑兵的指挥挺不错
Your command of the  cavalry was impressive.

正得益你的指挥 伪王史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩死了
Thanks to you, the false king  Stannis Baratheon is dead.

你知道谁完成了致命一击吗
Do you know who struck  the killing blow?

不管怎么说 这仍是一次伟大的胜利

你觉得自己是胜利者吗? 
Do you feel like a victor?

我跟王室作对 安排了你和珊莎·史塔克的婚事
I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage  to Sansa Stark.

你觉得夜袭敌人的马车 杀死疲劳 已经没多少人的拜拉席恩军队 和面对有备而来 供给充足的兰尼斯特军队是一回事吗? 
Do you think that  burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired,  outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared  and provisioned Lannister army?

清算之日早晚会到来
A reckoning will come.

我们需要北境的支持
We need the North to face it.

没了珊莎·史塔克 他们不会支持我们

因为我们手上没有珊莎·史塔克
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

你和她玩你那些游戏

你和铁群岛的继承人玩你那些游戏 现在他俩都跑了
You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

我已经派人去追他们了 还派出了我最好的猎狗
I have a team of men after them  with some of my best hounds.

没了珊莎 你就没法生出继承人了
Without Sansa, you won't be  able to produce an heir.

没了继承人 那…… 希望学士们是对的 希望瓦妲夫人确实怀了个男孩
And without an heir, well...  let's hope the maesters are right and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

我们得过去
We have to cross here.

我不行 只有这样才能甩掉猎狗
I can't.  It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

可太冷了 我不能 我过不去 我会死的
But it's too cold. I can't.  I won't make it. I'll die.

我见过他的猎狗是怎么对付人的
I've seen what his hounds  do to a person.

让他们安生一点
Tell them to settle down!

呆在这儿 我去把他们引开

如果没有你我肯定逃不掉的
No, I won't make it without you.

往北边逃 一直向北
Go north, only north.

I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.

她并未受苦 她已经去了
She's not suffering. She's gone.

没有人能够再伤害她了
No one can hurt her anymore.

从降生那天起 她就那么甜美可爱
From her first breath, she was so sweet.

我不知道这点她继承了谁
I don't know where she came from.

她一点都不像我
She was nothing like me.

不冷漠刻薄 不心怀嫉妒 只有善良
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

我想 如果我能培养出如此善良 如此天真的女孩 可能这意味着我并不是个怪物听着 听我说
I thought if I could  make something so good, so pure...  maybe I'm not a monster. Listenlisten to me.

她是我的女儿 但我让她失望了
She was my daughter and I failed her.

不 我知道她的死注定会发生
No, I knew this would happen.

多年以前 一位女巫告诉我
The witch told me years ago.

她预言说我将有三个子女 但都将在我之前而死
She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.

她跟我说的事情全都成真了
Everything she said came true.

你无法违抗命运
You couldn't have stopped it.

这些预言就是我的命运
It's prophecy.  It's fate.

你别去相信它们就好我怎能不信
You don't believe that.  Of course I do.

父亲死的那天 你亲口对我说
You told me yourself  when Father died.

你说我们将永远在一起
You said we had to stay together.

你说其他人想让我们分离 想把属于我们的东西夺走
You said people would try to  tear us apart, take what's ours.

这也是一个预言
That was a prophecy, too.

我没有在意你所说的 但一切都成了真
I didn't listen to you and  everything you said came true.

去他妈的命运和预言
Fuck prophecy.  Fuck fate.

去他妈的其他人
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

只有我们彼此才是 这个世界上唯一值得关注的事情
We're the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world.

所有他们从我们这里夺走的 我们将讨回来更多
And everything they've taken from us, we're going to take back and more.

我们将夺回一切
We're going to take  everything there is.

'七层地狱的周围都是圣人的灵魂
'The Seven Hells brim  with the souls of saintly men.

他们痛苦地嚎叫 他们的罪孽深重 无法感觉到下方的火焰 如果他们现在不再隐藏自己曾犯下的罪 他们便可得救'
They scream in agony  and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see  if not for a single sin they concealed,  they were saved.'

I'd like to see my brother.

他现在究竟如何? 至少告诉我这个
How is he?  At least tell me that.

我是王后 我要求见我弟弟一面
I am the queen and I  demand to see my brother.

罪人没有提要求的资格

大麻雀
总主教

乌尼亚修女有时候会狂热过头

并不是洛拉斯爵士让我来的
It isn't Ser Loras  that brings me here.

你的丈夫现在很想你
Your husband misses you dearly.

男人与女人之间的婚姻是神圣的
The love between a man  and wife is sacred.

这是众神对凡人爱的证明
It reflects the love  the gods have for all of us.

但罪恶让我们远离了神圣之路
But sin leads us away  from the sacred.

唯有忏悔能够洗除罪恶
And only confession can purge sin.

我没有可忏悔的
I have nothing to confess.

所以你觉得你清白无辜?
So you believe you are pure?

你本应在出发之时就开始忏悔

奥柏伦生来就是个冒险家
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

而我则是为统治而生的
And I was born to rule.

诸神不是傻瓜
The gods are not fools.

你会是个差劲的冒险家

至于奥柏伦 呃 他会是个糟透了的统治者
And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.

你不配做多恩人
You're not a Dornishman.

你不配做我们的亲王
You're not our prince.

你的儿子和你一样软弱

多恩再也不会由软弱的人来统治了

崔斯丹·马泰尔
道朗之子

我说了我不饿

We're never going to fix  what's wrong with this city from the top  of an 800foot pyramid.

我们穿得和普通的商人一样
We're dressed like common merchants.

可你走路的方式像个有钱人
You walk like a rich person.

你曾经用过很长时间来研究有钱人走路的方式吗?

你走路的样子就好像这些铺路石都是你的私人财产一样

这是谁写的?  那可不好说
Who wrote it?  Hard to know.

我们的女王在弥林城里没有以前那么受欢迎了
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.

鹰身女妖之子? 
The Sons of the Harpy?

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安夺走了他们最宝贵的财产 她一开始就告诉他们人是不能作为财产的
Daenerys Targaryen took away  their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't  even property to begin with.

你能想象他们为什么不高兴
You can see why they're unhappy.

不过 当然 这也有可能是获得自由的人所写的
Of course, it could also be the freed men.

很多原本的奴隶觉得丹妮莉丝抛弃了他们
Many of the former slaves feel  that Daenerys has abandoned them.

她确实骑龙飞走了 至今也没有回来
She did fly away on a  dragon and not come back.

恐惧让弥林陷入了停滞

不管你是谁 不管你到哪儿去 这城市里总有人想杀你
Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you.

我们没法对抗未知的敌人
We can't fight  an enemy we don't know.

鹰身女妖之子精心谋划了 那场竞技场中的袭击 这意味着有一个人在给他们发号施令
The Sons of the Harpy  planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take   orders from someone.

那你开始寻找这个人了吗? 
And have you started  looking for that someone?

很快他们就会回来 唱着关于戴金面具的人的歌

我不知道这世上还有什么能融化掉绵羊的角
Don't know anything else  that can melt a ram's horn.

达里奥·纳哈里斯
丹妮莉丝的情人

那就是说我们走对路了
We're on the right path, then.

也许她就是厌烦了当女王
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.

我觉得她不太喜欢这差使
I don't think she likes it very much.

她还没傻到会喜欢当女王
She's too smart to like it.

搞不好她飞到别的地方去了 一个远离像咱俩这样的人的地方
Maybe she's flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.

我曾游遍世界
I've been all over the world.

到哪儿都躲不开咱俩这样的人
There's no escaping men like us.

也躲不开她 哈? 
There's no escaping her, eh?

每次你都会回来的 为什么? 
You keep coming back. Why?

这感觉难道不会很糟吗 渴望着一个根本不想让你回来的人? 
Isn't it frustrating wanting someone  who doesn't want you back?

我知道 但你和他说过吗? 
I know, but have you tried telling him that?

在那个御林铁卫出事后 谁还会去哪儿啊? 
Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?

可能是他自找的 可能吧 但我不会冒险的
Probably had it coming. Maybe so, but I'm not risking it.

就是做不到 好吧
Just can't do it. All right.

实话说 他活该
Honesty as well. He gets it.

你在听吗 瞎女孩? 
Are you listening, blind girl?

听见他们说话了吗? 
Do you hear them talking?

有人和你说话吗? 
Do any of them talk to you?

起来打啊 瞎女孩
Stand and fight, blind girl.

这是你的问题 与我无关
That's your problem, not mine.

戴佛斯爵士 我们没有理由开打

我们都是受封的骑士
We are both anointed knights.

大家听见了吗? 没什么可怕的
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

I will grant amnesty to all brothers who throw down their arms before nightfall.

至于你 戴佛斯爵士 我会放你去南方 以自由之身 骑着新马
And you, Ser Davos, I will  allow you to travel south a free man with a fresh horse.

我想要些羊肉
I'd like some mutton.

什么?  我算不上猎人

如果你想的话 可以带走红袍祭司
You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.

或者把她留给我们 随你
Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.

但是要在黄昏前投降 否则将兵戎相见
But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.

谢谢你 艾里沙爵士
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

我们先自己讨论一下 然后给你个答复
We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.

兄弟们 我这辈子都在避免与这种人打交道
Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.

根据我的经验来看 一旦我们打开这扇门——
In my learned opinion, we open that door

他们会把我们杀个精光
And they'll slaughter us all.

他们想进来 就进来
They want to come in, they're gonna come in.

是的 我们不能让他们轻易得逞 艾迪是我们唯一的机会
Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them. Edd is our only chance.

忧郁的艾迪居然是我们最后的希望 这实在太他妈的惨了
It's a sad fucking statement if  Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

这不还有红袍祭司嘛
There's always the Red Woman.

一个红发女要怎么对付 40 个全副武装的守夜人? 
What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?

你还没见识过她的本事 我见过
You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.

再跟他打一轮 奈德
Give him another go, Ned.

抬高盾牌 不然我会把你的脑袋敲得嗡嗡响

I've seen her statue in the crypt.

父亲从不谈论她
My father never talked about her.

你别在这儿碍事行吗? 我们正练武呢
Benjen:  Would you get out of here? We're sparring.

等奈德去了鹰巢城 看你和谁练武
Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

不知道
Benjen:  I don't know.

可他有巨人的血统
Benjen:  But he's got giant's blood.

而你训练有素 依我看是场公平对决
And you've got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.

班杨冲锋前总会扬起下巴
Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.

他躲避时则会收回下巴 小姐
And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.

让少爷们去练武 威利斯
You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis.

赶紧过来 那不是你该待的地方
Come along, now. It's no place for you.

噢 奶妈 看看他的体格
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

他要是好好练武 一定所向披靡
If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable.

哎, 他不会练的, 他只是个马僮罢了
Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy.

拜托 再等一会儿
Please, a little longer.

你终于向我展示了我真正在乎的东西 却又将我带走
You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.

海底的风景纵然美丽 但若待得太久 你会被淹死

布兰登・史塔克需要你
Brandon Stark needs you.

要我干什么? 我坐在那里 看他坠入幻梦 然后什么都没有发生
For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.

他不会永远留在这里
He isn't going to stay here forever.

等到出去的那一天 他会需要你
And out there he needs you.

时间到了 戴佛斯爵士
Alliser:  It's time, Ser Davos.

打开门 让里面的弟兄 和平地出来
Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace.

微笑着对我说: '怎么样? '
Gives me a little smile like, 'Well?'

接下来 你们知道的 我从不害羞 我那话儿大得很, 我把它掏了出来
So, all right, you know, I've never been shy and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out.

她从没见过这么好的家伙
( laughing ) She's never seen anything like it.

我是说 她习惯了她弟弟的 可我听说
I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear,

詹姆・兰尼斯特那话儿还不如这根指头
Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.

她看到我的 我对天发誓她舔了舔嘴唇

Of course not. Then why didn't you let her come?

她完全有权来这儿
She has every right to be here.

我听说她不能出现在圣堂
They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.

不会再有人把你母亲关起来了
They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.

你为什么没去看过她? 
Why haven't you gone to see her?

她所承受的一切都是为了你
Everything she endured, she did it for you.

你以为我不知道吗? 
Don't you think I know that?

教团武装抓走她和玛格丽 我做了什么? 
When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do?

他们让她像妓女一样游街 我又做了什么? 
When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?

我们都有无能为力的时候
We all fail sometimes.

国王本该是全境守护者
The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.

If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?

去看看你母亲 请求她原谅
Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.

我想见我妻子
I want to see my wife.

诸神在等待玛格丽王后 忏悔罪行 请求宽恕
The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.

我要怎么赎罪
What atonement do I deserve?

你要血染圣堂? 
You would spill blood in this holy place?

噢, 诸神才不会在意
Oh, the gods won't mind.

他们制造的鲜血比我们凡人多得多
They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.

我罪有应得 我们都一样

她的下葬礼服是红色还是金色?

我不该这样, 但我……

我知道……我应该早点来
I know I should have come sooner.

我想来的 我错了
I wanted to. I was wrong.

我早该把他们全部处死

在大麻雀他们侮辱你之前 我就该把教会掀个底朝天 为了我 你就会这么做
I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me.

您教我变得坚强… 我没能做到

我们一直在清查下手的人, 迄今为止毫无线索

但我相信 继续下去一定会有所收获
Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.

阿斯塔波和渊凯已不再向我们求助
Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.

也许是他们的小阴谋
Perhaps they can tell us their secret.

奴隶主夺回了那两座城市

Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers.

我们的龙呢? 金字塔下还有两条龙啊
What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.

丹妮莉丝女王离开后 它们没碰过任何食物
They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.

丹妮莉丝是龙女王
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

显然 让龙饿着是不好的
Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious.

如果龙不想吃 你如何强迫它吃? 
If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?

龙不适合关起来
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

你怎么知道?  我就是知道
How do you know this? That's what I do.

我不仅好酒, 知道的事也不少
I drink and I know things.

伊耿用来征服维斯特洛的巨龙 它们一飞冲天 扶摇万里
The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles.

可到了后来 丹妮莉丝的先辈们 把它们用铁链锁在坑里
Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens.

短短几代之后 最后几条龙还没猫大
A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats.

必须卸掉锁链 否则它们就废了
They must be unchained or they'll waste away.

弥桑黛 你接近那些龙多少次了? 
Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?

很多次  它们可曾伤害你?

龙是智慧生物
Dragons are intelligent.

某些学士声称它们比人还聪明

它们对朋友友好 对敌人则是满腔怒火

我可是他们的朋友  它们会明白这个?

我是你们妈妈的朋友
I'm friends with your mother.

不能把帮忙的人吃掉哟

我小时候 叔叔问我命名日想要什么礼物

我求叔叔说想要一条龙
I begged him for one of you.

我甚至告诉他: '不用太大只的也行. '
'It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,' I told him.

所有人都乐坏了 好像这是他们听过的最滑稽的事
Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.

然后我父亲告诉我 最后的巨龙死在一个世纪之前
Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago.

那晚 我哭着入睡
I cried myself to sleep that night.

下回我再冒出这种念头 务必照我脸上来一拳
Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.

Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?

很明显有人帮他们
They obviously had help.

珊莎小姐当然不可能凭一己之力干掉这些人
I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.

多谢你的报告, 卡史塔克大人
Thank you for this report, Lord Karstark.

我们知道她去了哪里
We know where she's going.

她哥哥在黑城堡
Her brother's at Castle Black.

奈德・史塔克仅剩的儿子? 
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

琼恩・雪诺是个私生子, 不是史塔克
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

只要有一个史塔克尚在人间 您在北境的统治就永无宁日
Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.

黑城堡的南面是不设防的
Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.

而且那里没剩下几个人, 都是些农夫和窃贼而已
And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves.

一支小分队就能攻陷黑城堡 杀掉琼恩 . 雪诺――
With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow

谋杀守夜人军团总司令? 
Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

你是要逼反北境所有的家族
You'd unite every house in the North against us.

我们用不着所有的家族
We don't need every house in the North.

安柏家 曼德勒家 卡史塔克家 他们麾下的军队比北境其他家族加起来还多
The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.

有他们的支持就没人能挑战我们
With their support, none could challenge us.

罗柏国王将我父亲斩首那一天 史塔克就失去了我家族的支持
The Starks lost my house the day King Robb cut off my father's head.

北境是时候更换新鲜血液了
It's time for new blood in the North.

如果你执意像疯狗般行事 别人就会把你视为疯狗
If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you'll be treated as a mad dog.

呼来喝去 最后杀了喂猪
Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.

这儿很冷 拉姆斯 我得给他喂奶
It's cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.

拉姆斯 你父亲在哪儿? 
Ramsay, where is your father?

波顿大人在哪儿? 
Where is Lord Bolton?

我会离开临冬城的  我回河间地去
I'll leave Winterfell. I'll go back to the Riverlands.

我比较喜欢当独生子
I prefer being an only child.

我看见她跟一个男的同行
Brienne:  I saw her with a man.

那人应该不会伤害她
I don't think he hurt her.

他俩彼此都不想分开
She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her.

你不知道她去哪儿了? 
You don't know which way she went?

我花了三天时间找她
I spent three days looking for her.

只是穿着不像个小姐的样子
She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.

临冬城里发生了什么? 
What happened at Winterfell?

我早就该跟你走
I should have gone with you while I had the chance.

珊莎小姐 那是个艰难的选择
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

但我们不能回避
We've all had to make difficult choices.

我们不该生火的
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

他会继续追杀我们
He won't stop hunting us.

我们只需赶到黑城堡
We just have to make it to Castle Black.

只要找到琼恩 拉姆斯就抓不到我们了
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us.

我只要踏进黑城堡 琼恩就会杀了我
Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.

我会告诉他布兰和瑞肯的真相
I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.

还有我杀掉磨坊男孩来代替他们的真相
And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.

还有我把罗德利克爵士砍头的真相
And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

还有我背叛罗柏的真相
And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed.

当你披上黑衣, 一切罪行都会被宽恕
When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.

我不愿被宽恕
I don't want to be forgiven.

我对您的家族所做的一切 永远无法弥补
I can never make amends to your family for the things I've done.

他们本来可以保护你安全无恙
They'll keep you safer than I ever could.

你不和我们一起走? 
You're not coming with us?

我真想把你一路带到长城
I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.

为此我宁愿献出生命
I would have died to get you there.

我可以带走一匹马吗? 
May I take one of the horses?

葛洛佛家族夺回了深林堡
Yara:  The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.

那些守卫它的铁种呢? 
And the ironborn who held it?

他们战至最后一人
They died fighting to a man.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

但他们死了 入侵行动失败了
But they did and our invasion died with them.

深林堡是我们在大陆的最后一个据点
Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.

我们会攻取更多
Then we will take more.

为什么? 为了更多的松果和岩石? 
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

我们在海上不可战胜 但我们守不住城堡和土地 打不过大陆上的军队
We can defeat anyone at sea, but we'll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.

如果我的船长们违抗命令 擅离职守 把部下消耗在愚蠢的任务中 我们当然会输
Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.

我不会为试图营救席恩而道歉
I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.

你的王国又在哪里? 
Where is your kingdom?

我们能拿下那些城堡 是因为北方佬去了南方打仗
We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war.

上一次我们做得过火的时候
The last time we provoked them too far,

我在那窗前眼睁睁看着他们突破了我们的城墙 摧毁了我们的塔楼
I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers.

那天我失去了两个哥哥
I lost two brothers that day.

我失去了三个儿子
And I lost three sons.

他们说, 这是五王之战
The War of the Five Kings, they call it.

好吧, 其他四个都死了
Well, the other four are dead.

等你统治铁群岛时 想怎么和平都随你
When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want.

但现在, 闭上嘴, 服从我 不然我找个听话的来当继承人
But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.

蠢货 给你的国王让路
You fool, move aside for your king.

我一直都是这样做的 不是吗 哥哥? 
Haven't I always, brother?

我以为你早在异乡的海底烂成了骨头
I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

我走以后, 习俗变了? 
Has the custom changed since I've been gone?

你不应该重复这句话吗? 
Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

你不用我掺和也能嘲弄我们的神
You can mock our god without my help.

我没有嘲弄淹神
I don't mock the Drowned God.

我就是淹神
I am the Drowned God.

从旧镇到魁尔斯 无论是谁, 看见我的船帆就会祈祷
From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.

你老了 哥哥
( chuckles ) You're old, brother.

你的时代过去了
You've had your time.

是时候退位让贤了
Now let another rule.

我听说你在玉海的风暴里 丧失了理智
I heard you lost your mind during a storm on the Jade Sea.

他们把你绑在桅杆上以防你跳海
They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.

风暴过去后 你割了他们的舌头
And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.

什么样的铁种 会在风暴中失去理智? 
What kind of an ironborn loses his senses during a storm?

我就是风暴 哥哥
I am the storm, brother.

世上唯一的风暴
The first storm and the last.

而你挡我的路了
And you're in my way.

主 请将您的仆人巴隆收归波涛之下
Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves.

以他的血肉喂养您王国的子民
Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.

将他的骨骸归于深邃的大海 与他的祖先和孩子一同长眠
Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.

逝者不死
All: What is dead may never die.

我会找出凶手
I'm going to find out who did this.

我会把他们活着拿去喂鲨鱼
I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.

我以海盐王座发誓
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

你不能以海盐王座发誓 除非选王会选择了你
The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

我父亲想要我来统治
My father would have wanted me to rule.

你父亲无权这样做 律法讲得清清楚楚
Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.

也许你会成为史上首位统治铁民的女人
Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.

抱歉 夫人 我不是有意打扰
I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.

你没有打扰我
You interrupt nothing.

我想您知道我为何而来
I assume you know why I'm here.

你告诉我我才能知道
I will after you tell me.

是关于总司令
It's about the Lord Commander.

前总司令
The former Lord Commander.

梅丽珊卓
红袍祭司

您是否知道有什么魔法…… 能帮到他? 
Do you know of any magic...  that could help him?

如果你想帮助他 就让他安息吧
If you want to help him, leave him be.

的确存在这样的能力
There are some with this power.

您见过吗? 
Have you seen it done?

我见过一个死而复生的人 但施法的祭司…… 这种事本不该进行
I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it it shouldn't have been possible.

但它确实可行 现在也应该可以
But it was. It could be now.

我见过您喝下致命的毒药
I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.

我见过您生下影子的恶魔
I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.

我曾笃信的一切 我曾在圣火中目睹的伟大胜利 全是谎言
Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie.

你一直都是对的
You were right all along.

光之王从未给予我启示
The Lord never spoke to me.

很显然我不是个虔诚的人
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

七神 淹神 树神 对我来说都是一样的
Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.

我不是在向光之王求助
I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.

我是在向那个曾向我展现奇迹的女人求助
I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.

我从未有过这种天赋
I never had this gift.

白灵
雪诺的冰原狼

梅丽珊卓
红袍祭司

你都记得什么? 
What do you remember?

奥利… 他一刀扎进我的心脏
Olly...  he put a knife in my heart.

红袍女士令你死而复生
The lady brought you back.

后来呢 他们捅了你之后 你死之后 去了什么地方? 
Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go?

什么都没有
There was nothing at all.

真主带你回来必有原因
The Lord let you come back for a reason.

史坦尼斯并非预言中的王子 但总有人是
Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.

能让我俩单独待会儿么? 
Could you give us a moment?

要我看 这件事疯狂到了极点
That's completely fucking mad, seems to me.

我没法想象你自己怎么看
I can only imagine how it seems to you.

我做了自认为正确的事
I did what I thought was right.

结果被人谋害
And I got murdered for it.

或许我们永远不会知道
Maybe we'll never know.

只要一息尚存 就去战斗
You fight for as long as you can.

尽可能摆平这些破事
You clean up as much of the shit as you can.

我不知道该怎么做
I don't know how to do that.

我以为自己知道 可…
I thought I did, but...

忧郁的艾迪
守夜人事务官

他们以为你是神
They think you're some kind of god.

所以才会死而复生
The man who returned from the dead.

神的鸡鸡哪能那么小? 
What kind of god would have a pecker that small?

你的眼睛还是棕色
Your eyes are still brown.

但你还是你吗? 
Is that still you in there?

你得等等才能烧掉我了
Hold off on burning my body for now.

你确定你还是你? 
You sure that's still you in there?

我有没有告诉过你 我曾以为大洋念做'扬' 因为一眼望去全是水波扬起? 
Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?

它们写法不同 发音却一样
They're spelled different, but they sound the same.

当然 这是在我识字之前的事了
It was before I learned how to read, obviously.

山姆 你是不是病了? 
Sam, are you going to be sick?

坚持一下 很快就到南方了
Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.

想想能看到旧镇我就激动
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

船长说旧镇是维斯特洛最美的城市
Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros.

你又想吐? 
Are you going to vomit again?

不不不 只是…
No. No, no, no. I'm...

学城不准女人进
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

你和小山姆不能住在那儿
There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.

黑城堡也不准女人进 我不也住了很久? 
I stayed at Castle Black. There's no women allowed there.

学城跟黑城堡不一样
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

那儿没有琼恩·雪诺或伊蒙学士帮我行方便
I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.

那我住旧镇好了
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

带个孩子 身无分文? 
With a baby and no money?

不去旧镇的话 你要带我去哪儿? 
So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?

我爹… 算了 别指望他了 不过我妈心肠很好 我妹妹人也不错
My father's... well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.

她们会照顾你们母子
They'll take care of you both.

这可是你说的
That's what you said.

我这么说 是因为我希望你和小山姆平安
I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.

这是我唯一的心愿 如果我能当上学士 到时候就能辅助琼恩 你们也就安全了
That's all I want...  to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.

你要帮我们 还要帮世界上其他的…
Us and everyone else in the world.

我才不在乎其他人
I don't care about them.

好吧 我在乎 但不是特别在乎
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

我在乎的是你和他
I care about you and him.

只有你真正在乎我们
You're the only one who ever has.

如果你觉得这么做最好 我们就听你的
If you think it's for the best, we trust you.

我宁可你用东西砸我 然后跑掉
I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.

我绝不会对我孩子的父亲那么做
I'd never do that to the father of my son.

他旁边是霍兰·黎德
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

拂晓神剑
The Sword of the Morning.

父亲说亚瑟·戴恩是他见过最强的剑士
Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.

我在三叉戟河上没见到你们
I looked for you on the Trident.

我们在的话 你的篡夺者朋友就该入土了
Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.

疯王已死
The Mad King is dead.

入土的则是雷加
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

你们为何不去守护你们的王子? 
Why weren't you there to protect your prince?

王子命我们在此守护
Our prince wanted us here.

在未来的战争中 祝你们好运
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

他比我父亲强
He's better than my father.

这故事我都听一千遍了
Heard the story a thousand times.

他在背后捅刀
He stabbed him in the back.

今天看得差不多了
That's enough for one day.

改天继续
We'll visit again another time.

我只想看看他去了哪里  该走了
I want to see where he's going. Time to go.

带我回去那里 我要回去
Take me back there. I want to go back.

也许他只是听到了风声   他听到我了
Maybe he heard the wind. He heard me.

过去已成过去 一切都已盖棺定论
The past is already written. The ink is dry.

谁在塔里? 
What's in that tower?

我要回去看看
I want to go back there.

我告诉过你无数次 在不属于你的时空停留过久 就回不来了
I've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return.

我干嘛回来? 
Why do I want to return?

就为继续当个残废? 
So I can be a cripple again?

跟长在树里的老家伙闲扯淡? 
So I can talk to an old man in a tree?

你以为我愿意在这里坐上一千年 极目远眺这个世界 任由树根长进我的身体? 
You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?

因为我在等你
I was waiting for you.

我可不想变成你这样
I don't want to be you.

你不会永远待在这儿
You won't be here forever.

你不会变成树里的老家伙
You won't be an old man in a tree.

但离开之前 你必须学习
But before you leave, you must learn.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
弥林的女王

真搞不懂 你们居然还穿得住一身皮甲
I don't know how you stand it in all that leather.

能让我们单独谈谈吗
If we could have the room.

你今天好美 亲爱的 真的
You look lovely today, my dear. You really do.

你怎么做到汗都不流就爬完这些台阶的? 
How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.

你要是想拷问我 叫他们回来动手就行
If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.

尽管很多时候有些人活该受虐
Though it so often is what people deserve.

拷打的确也能问出答案
And it does provide answers.

不过通常都是错误答案罢了
But they're usually the wrong answers.

我的任务却是找到正确答案
My job is to find the right answers.

知道我会怎么做吗? 
Do you know how I do that?

我会让人开心
I do it by making people happy.

我也想让你开心 瓦拉
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

这是你的名字 对吧 瓦拉? 
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

我知道你是谁 知道你做过什么
I know who you are and what you've done.

你为达目的献出了你的身体 这就已经比大部分人做得多了
You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do.

你还帮助鹰身女妖之子 谋杀无垢者和次子团的人
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.

无垢者和次子团是外国的战士 由外国的女王带领 毁掉了我们的城市与历史
The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.

从你的立场看 你的行为无可指责
Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective.

当然了 你我立场不同
I have a different perspective, of course.

我觉得 重点是你应该站在我的立场上想想问题 正如我也会试着换位思考
I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours.

因为这是我让你和多姆都开心 的唯一办法
Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy.

是这么发音吧 多姆? 
That is how you pronounce it... Dom?

很抱歉我不太擅长这种语言
I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.

那双棕色的大眼睛 希望不要太招女生喜欢
Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.

呵 你还真是个解放者 对吗? 
Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?

你不会拷问我 只会用我儿子作要挟
You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son.

孩子是无辜的
Children are blameless.

我从没伤害过他们
I have never hurt them.

你儿子目前没危险 我向你发誓
Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you.

至于你呢 亲爱的 你曾密谋杀害女王的士兵
But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.

我们都明白你将面临何种刑罚
We both know the penalty for that crime.

没了母亲 可怜的多姆该怎么活? 
How will poor Dom get on without his mother?

他还有气喘病
And with his breathing problem.

哪怕我招了一个字 他们都会杀了我
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

就算你不杀我 他们也会
So either you kill me or they do.

是啊 站在你的立场 这是个问题
Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.

但你还有第三个选择
There is a third option, though.

明天有艘船去潘托斯
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

我已经帮一个女人和她儿子订了位置
I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.

还留下一袋银币帮你们重新开始
I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.

不过 恐怕我得 喊一个穿皮甲的朋友帮你扛出去
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leatherclad friends back in to carry it.

我觉得袋子太沉了
Far too heavy for me.

明天天一亮就开船
The boat sails at dawn.

你必须马上做决定
You need to decide now.

是你和多姆开始新的生活 还是…
A new life for you and Dom or...

就这么干等? 
What should we do while we wait?

不如干点什么打发时间吧? 
To pass the time, what should we do?

不聊点什么? 
What should we talk about?

你会说十九种语言
You speak 19 languages.

偶尔用它们聊聊天总可以吧
You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.

你们俩 总是待在一起
You two, you spend a great deal of time together.

我不在的话 你们会聊什么? 
What would you be talking about if I weren't here?

聊我带领无垢者一起巡逻的事
When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.

我们巡逻时看到了什么
What we see on patrol.

巡逻时抓住了谁
Who we captured on patrol.

很好 非常好
That's good. That's very good.

我觉得聊天不止如此
I was thinking more of a conversation.

有位智者说过 真正的世界历史 由豪华房间里发生的伟大聊天组成
A wise man once said the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.

好吧 不聊天
All right, no conversations.

你俩不玩游戏吗 从没玩过? 
You don't play games, either one of you, ever?

游戏是小孩玩的
Games are for children.

我曾经的主人克拉兹尼有时会让我们玩游戏
My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.

看 一个好的开始
There, that's a start.

但只有女孩能玩 不不不
Only the girls. No, no, no.

不是 当然不是那种游戏
Not that. Of course not that.

我是说 纯洁又好玩的游戏
Innocent games. Fun games.

好吧 不喝酒
All right. No drinking.

不喝也能玩
We can play without drinking.

这是个很棒的游戏 我发明的
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.

我猜你们的过去
I make a statement about your past.

如果我猜错了 罚酒
If I'm wrong, I drink.

如果我猜对了… 不喝酒可能就玩不下去了
And if I'm right...  maybe we can't play without drinking.

哦 你真够准时的
Oh, you took your time.

我忙着打听究竟是谁资助鹰身女妖之子
I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

有些事情你急不得 你找到了吗? 
Some things you can't rush. You found out?

阿斯塔波的善主 还有渊凯的贤主
The Good Masters of Astapor and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

以及他们的瓦兰提斯朋友
With help from their friends in Volantis.

你根本不用担心本地的叛乱
You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.

我们只需要担心 三个资助他们的富有城邦
We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.

我们曾经征服过阿斯塔波和渊凯
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

我们可再次征服他们 并处决那些奴隶主
We will do it again and execute the Masters.

若无垢者出兵重夺阿斯塔波和渊凯 谁留下保卫弥林的自由民? 
If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai, who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?

如果不出兵 如何阻止流血
If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?

奴隶主只说一种语言
The Masters speak only one language.

多年来他们一直对我说这种语言
They spoke it to me for many years.

我了解它更胜母语
I know it better than my mother tongue.

想让他们听话 我们必须用这种语言回敬
If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them.

让这些话为他们送终
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

所以要打了? 
So we will fight them?

告诉我 你的小小鸟儿能把消息传到 阿斯塔波的善主 渊凯的贤主 以及瓦兰提斯仁慈的奴隶贩子那里去么? 
Tell me, can your little birds get a message to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

当然 人无常善变 但小小鸟们永远值得信任
Of course. Men can be fickle, but birds I always trust.

亚瑟 你的眼睛看起来好多了
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

你母亲的下巴怎么样了? 
How's your mother's jaw?

这结果相当不错
That worked out rather nicely.

瓦里斯大人会回来吗? 
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

他管我们叫小小鸟儿
He called us his little birds.

说起这个可就有意思了
It's funny you should mention that.

猜猜我今天碰巧找到了什么
Guess what I happened to find today.

多恩的梅子蜜饯
Candied plums from Dorne.

记住 如果你们的伙伴 喜欢吃糖果 或者需要帮助 尽管来找我
Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me.

只需跟我说说悄悄话
All I need in return are whispers.

不用害怕
No need to be afraid.

我的朋友就是他的朋友
He's friends with all my friends.

瓦里斯的小小鸟吗? 
Varys's little birds?

现在是您的小小鸟 陛下
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

你到底对他做了什么? 
What did you do to him exactly?

我一直没能弄清楚
I haven't been able to get a clear answer.

哦 我做了很多事情
Oh, a number of things.

他能明白我们在说什么吗? 
Does he understand what we're saying?

我是说 可以像以前那样 理解完整句子吗? 
I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.

完全可以
He understands well enough.

那就告诉他杀去圣堂 把大麻雀的脑袋瓜捏碎
So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon.

大麻雀有数百人的教团武装保护他
The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him.

格雷果爵士没办法对付他们所有人
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

他也不需要
And he won't have to.

他只需要对付一个
He'll only have to face one.

教会提出正式的指控了吗? 
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?

我真期待见证这场比武审判
That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.

别局限于君临
Don't stop at the city.

我要小小鸟去多恩 去高庭 去北境
I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North.

如果有人想看我们的笑话 坐收渔利
If someone is planning on making our losses their gains,

如果有人敢嘲笑他们的太后 说她赤身游街 满身污垢
If someone is laughing at the queen who walked naked through the streets covered in shit,

我要知道他们是谁
I want to know who they are.

他们人在何处
I want to know where they are.

和瓦里斯大人一样坏 科本还要更坏
As bad as Lord Varys was, Qyburn is worse.

我跟他们都说了 我说了
I told them all. I told them.

他傲慢 危险
He's arrogant, dangerous.

他不会无缘无故地就被赶出学城
You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason.

但没有人听我的话
And no one listened to my advice.

他在格雷果·克里冈身上做的事是邪恶的
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination.

我们从未同意这个实验
We never sanctioned this experiment.

我个人认为我们最好 把这个野兽杀…
I for one think it will be in our best interest to have the beast dest...

有什么可以效劳的吗?  你怎么在这? 
Can I help you? Why are you here?

我的母亲…  亲爱的 我被邀请来 帮助解决一些棘手的问题 譬如王后被监禁
My mother... I was invited, my dear, to help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen's imprisonment.

亏你还提起这个
Thank you for bringing it up.

我们早就该讨论如何应对我所受的侮辱了
It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.

玛格丽才是王后
Margaery is the queen.

你不是 因为你没有嫁给国王
You are not the queen because you're not married to the king.

我能明白你们家族里 这些事情搞得有点混乱
I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.

这里是御前会议
This is a small council meeting.

你无权出席御前会议
You have no position on the small council.

我是御林铁卫队长
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

御林铁卫队长 有权出席御前会议
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the small council.

派席尔大学士 你认可吗? 
Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?

杰洛·海塔尔爵士 曾在疯王的御前会议有一席之地
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council.

但当然了 那是疯王
Of course, that was the Mad King.

劳勃国王认为不可
King Robert saw things differently.

弥赛菈的死怎么说 叔叔? 
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

您认为血亲被谋杀 是一个棘手的问题么? 
Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?

谋杀弥赛菈的那个女人 推翻了马泰尔家族 控制了多恩
The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.

我们需要讨论的问题太多了
We've got a lot to discuss.

既然你们无法让我们离开 就继续吧
And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.

的确 我们无法让你们离开
No, we cannot make you leave.

而你们也无法强迫我们留在这
And you cannot make us stay.

除非你让那东西把我们都杀了
Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.

我母亲想来看望她女儿最后的安息之地
My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place.

抱歉 陛下
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

这不可以 现在还不行
That's not possible. Not yet.

那何时可以? 
When will it be possible?

直到她赎清罪孽
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

你已斩下她的头发 令她在众目睽睽之下赤裸游行
You cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city.

这还不够赎罪吗? 
That wasn't the full atonement?!

她必须在七位修士面前接受审判 让我们了解她的全部罪行
She must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extent of her sins.

我要你打开大门 让她来看望弥赛菈的安息之地
I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.

那么这对你意味着什么? 
And what does that mean to you?

这对我意义非凡
It means a great deal to me.

王权与信仰 乃是世界的两大支柱
The Crown and the Faith are the twin pillars of the world.

您知道这话是谁告诉我的? 
Do you know who told me that?

我那个'不洁'的母亲? 
My mother who is unclean?

我那个经受你种种折磨 却仍需赎罪的母亲? 
My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?

您认为圣母首度降临是何情形? 
How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?

世上的男男女女 如何首度感受到圣母的存在? 
How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence?

是通过自己的母亲
It was through their own mothers.

瑟曦非常虚伪 这点您心知肚明
There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei. You know that.

但当她谈及您时 母爱胜过了一切
But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.

她对您的爱 比世上任何东西都要真实 因为这种爱并非来自这个世界
Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn't come from this world.

她对您说话的时候 您看见了圣母的影子
You've seen her when she talks to you.

又一项我应当忏悔的罪孽
One more thing for me to atone for.

哦陛下 您… 我可以坐下吗? 
Your Grace, do you... may I?

您的母亲踏上赎罪之行 是为了回到您身边
When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.

我还是不明白你为什么不依不饶 还要让她承受更多折磨
I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.

并不是我要这样做 是诸神
It's not what I want. It's what the gods want.

诸神向我们传达旨意 是否遵从则取决于我们
They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it.

如果我们一心向善 追求公正 那所有人都得遵从诸神的旨意 包括国王在内
If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings.

真正的领袖会让最睿智者来辅佐他
A true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can.

而没有谁比诸神更睿智
And no one is wiser than the gods.

我祖父跟我说过类似的话
My grandfather once said something similar.

但他并没提到诸神的部分
Except for the part about the gods.

诸神透过他的嘴教诲你 无论他自己有没有意识到
The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not.

正如诸神也透过您的母亲
As they work through your mother.

每个人的内心都充满善意
There's so much good in all of us.

而我们能做的是引导他人向善
The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.

你在来这里之前是谁? 
Who were you before you came here?

跟我讲讲艾莉亚·史塔克的家庭
Tell me about Arya Stark's family.

她的父亲是艾德·史塔克
Her father was Eddard Stark.

她的母亲是凯特琳·史塔克
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

她有一个姐姐 珊莎 还有四个兄弟
She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers.

以及同父异母的哥哥琼恩
And a halfbrother Jon.

他们现在何处? 
And where are they now?

就女孩所知 他们可能已经死了
They may be dead for all a girl knows.

跟我讲讲猎狗的事
Tell me about the Hound.

艾莉亚·史塔克丢下他等死 他在她的名单上
Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.

他不在她的名单上
He was not on her list anymore.

她把他从里面去掉了
She had taken him off it.

为什么? 她不想让他死了吗? 
Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?

她既想又不想
She did and she did not.

还有谁在艾莉亚·史塔克可笑的小名单上? 
Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?

你想杀的人肯定不止这些
That can't be everyone you want to kill.

你确定自己没有忘记谁吗? 
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

你想让女孩说出哪个名字? 
Which name would you like a girl to speak?

如果女孩告诉某人她的名字
If a girl tells me her name,

某人会把眼睛还给她
I will give her eyes back.

如果女孩真的是无名之辈 那她应当无所畏惧
If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear.

安柏家族可是以忠诚著称
The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

以忠诚于史塔克著称
Famously loyal to the Starks.

而你 卡史塔克大人
And you, Lord Karstark.

你的家族与史塔克有共同的血脉 不是吗? 
Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they?

我们却都来到这里 世易时移
But here we are. Times change.

当我父亲成为北境守护的时候 你的家族拒绝向他效忠
When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners.

你父亲是个混蛋
Your father was a cunt.

我亲爱的父亲 北境守护…
My beloved father, the Warden...

你父亲是个混蛋 所以你杀了他
Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.

想来我大概也会这么对付我父亲 如果他没有行行好自己死掉的话
I might have done the same to my father if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.

我父亲是被我们的敌人毒害的
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

你来临冬城做什么 安柏大人? 
Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?

那个野种琼恩·雪诺率领一支野人军队过了长城
The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

我们的领地比你们这帮混球更靠北
We're farther north than any of you fuckers.

每当野人南下 我们总是首先拿起武器
Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.

我喜欢打野人 我一辈子都在干这事
I like fighting wildlings. Been doing it all my life.

但他们人太多了 我们没法单干
But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.

所以你现在是来求助? 
So now you've come seeking help?

我们得互相帮助
We need to help each other.

天气越冷 那些操山羊的蛮子就会越往南迁徙
The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam.

过不了多久就会到这儿
Won't take them long to get here.

你觉得一群野人能攻占临冬城? 
You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?

如果有琼恩·雪诺作他们的头儿 那可说不准
If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.

他远比我们中的任何人更了解这里
He knows this place better than we ever will.

向波顿家族宣誓效忠
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

承认我为北境守护 我就与你并肩作战 除掉那个野种 外加他所有的野人朋友
Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.

我不会吻你的脏手
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

按传统 封臣应向封君下跪
Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.

我也不会这么做
I'm not doing that either.

我凭什么要相信一个不尊重传统的人? 
Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?

你父亲尊重传统
Your father honored tradition.

他向罗柏·史塔克下跪
Knelt for Robb Stark.

拥戴其为北境之王
Called him King of the North.

罗柏·史塔克应当相信你父亲吗? 
Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?

看来 我们陷入了一个小小的僵局
Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.

去他妈的下跪 去他妈的宣誓
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

我有个礼物给你
I've got a gift for you.

希望是个姑娘 我喜欢红发的
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

还有个男孩 年轻又健康
And the boy, nice and young.

卡史塔克大人肯定喜欢
The way Karstark likes them.

你怎么证明这是瑞肯·史塔克? 
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

欢迎回家 史塔克大人
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

有什么遗言 现在说吧
If you have any last words, now is the time.

你不该活着
You shouldn't be alive.

你们也不该谋杀我
Neither was killing me.

我母亲还住在白港
My mother's still living at White Harbor.

告诉她我死在与野人的战斗中
Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

我有过选择 总司令大人
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

背叛你或背叛守夜人
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

你将一支野人军队带到了我们的土地上
You brought an army of wildlings into our lands.

一支杀人犯和掠袭者组成的军队
An army of murderers and raiders.

如果让我知道结局 再重来一次
If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up,

我祈祷自己能再次做出正确的选择
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

我确信你会的 艾里沙爵士
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

可是你 雪诺大人 你将永世不得翻身
But you, Lord Snow, you'll be fighting their battles forever.

我们应该烧掉这些尸体
We should burn the bodies.

你要我做什么? 
What do you want me to do with this?

你拥有黑城堡了
You have Castle Black.

去干什么? 
What are you gonna do?

我和你在艰难屯的时候
I was with you at Hardhome.

我们看到了外面有什么
We saw what's out there.

我们都知道他们往这来了
We know it's coming here.

你怎能在这时抛下我们? 
How can you leave us now?

我能做的我都做了 你知道的
I did everything I could. You know that.

你发过誓 是的 我把我的生命献给了守夜人
You swore a vow. Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

我付出了我的生命 '夜夜皆然'
I gave my life. For all nights to come.

他们杀了我 艾迪! 我的兄弟们
They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.

你还想让我留在这里? 
You want me to stay here after that?

你还记得老奶妈以前常做的腰花馅饼吗? 
Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?

加了豌豆和洋葱的? 
With the peas and onions?

我们一开始就不该离开临冬城
We never should have left Winterfell.

你不希望回到我们离开的那天吗? 
Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?

我真想对着我自己大喊'别去啊 白痴'
I want to scream at myself, 'Don't go, you idiot.'

我花了很多时间回想当初我对你有多么混蛋
I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.

我真希望我能改变一切
I wish I could change everything.

就承认吧 我很讨人厌
I was awful, just admit it.

你偶尔有些讨厌
You were occasionally awful.

但我肯定我是很无趣的
I'm sure I can't have been great fun.

总是在你们一起玩的时候缩在墙角闷闷不乐
Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.

你能原谅我吗?  没什么好原谅的
Can you forgive me? There's nothing to forgive.

原谅我 好吧
Forgive me. All right.

好吧 我原谅你
All right, I forgive you.

你觉得都几千年了 守夜人总该学会怎么酿出好酒吧
You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.

要是我不照看着你 父亲的在天之灵不会放过我的
If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me.

我不能待在这了 在发生了这些事以后
I can't stay here, not after what happened.

我们只有一个地方可以去
There's only one place we can go.

我们是该叫波顿打铺盖卷走人吗? 
Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?

我们会从他们手里夺回来的
We'll take it back from them.

我没有军队
I don't have an army.

你救了多少野人? 
How many wildlings did you save?

他们不是来这为我效命的
They didn't come here to serve me.

他们的命是你给的
They owe you their lives.

你觉得有卢斯・波顿继续做北境守护他们会安全吗? 
You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

珊莎 临冬城是我们的家
Sansa. Winterfell is our home.

是我们的 也是艾莉亚 布兰和瑞肯的
It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.

不管他们在哪 它都属于我们家族
Wherever they are, it belongs to our family.

我们必须为它而战
We have to fight for it.

我已经厌倦战斗了
I'm tired of fighting.

自从离家我就一直在战斗
It's all I've done since I left home.

我杀过守夜人的兄弟
I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.

我杀过野人 我杀过我敬仰的人
I've killed wildlings. I've killed men that I admire.

我绞死了一个比布兰还小的男孩
I hanged a boy younger than Bran.

如果我们不夺回北境 我们永远不会安全
If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe.

我需要你帮助我
I want you to help me.

但如果有必要 我会亲自动手
But I'll do it myself if I have to.

梅丽珊卓
红袍祭司

你会留在黑城堡吗? 
Will you stay here at Castle Black?

我会谨遵琼恩・雪诺的命令
I will do as Jon Snow commands.

你现在效命琼恩・雪诺了? 
You serve Jon Snow now?

他是预言中的王子
He's the prince that was promised.

原谅我 女士 我还以为那是史坦尼斯
Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.

你们那边发生了什么? 
What happened down there?

打了场仗 史坦尼斯被打败了
There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.

公主怎么样了? 
What happened to the princess?

我看到史坦尼斯的大军被击溃
I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field.

女士 我是戴佛斯・席渥斯爵士
My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

我那时是蓝礼・拜拉席恩的御林铁卫
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

直到蓝礼被血魔法暗杀而死
Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.

那已经过去了
That's in the past now.

是的 是过去了
Yes, it's in the past.

并不意味着我忘掉了
It doesn't mean I forget.

他承认了 你知道的
He admitted it, you know.

就在我处决他之前
Just before I executed him.

谷地守护者!
The Defender of the Vale!

我错过了你的命名日 来吧
I missed your name day. Go on.

最名贵最稀有的鸟
The greatest and rarest of birds.

贝里席 上次我见到你的时候 你告诉我你要带着珊莎・史塔克回到五指半岛
Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.

但是不久前我们收到报告 说她嫁给了临冬城的拉姆斯・波顿
And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

去五指半岛的路上 我们遭到了一大批波顿军队的袭击
On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men.

他们似乎明确地知道我们何时出行 也明确地知道我们护送的是谁
Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.

你把我当白痴吗? 
Do you take me for a fool?

告诉我 罗伊斯大人 有多少人知道我与珊莎・史塔克的出行计划? 
Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?

我只把我的打算告诉过你 别无二人
I shared my intentions with you and no one else.

在别人家里诽谤别人 接下来便是兵戎相见
Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him.

你的家属于谷地 而谷地主人就站在我们面前
Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

主人说了算
And only his judgment concerns me.

我们应该把他扔下月门吗? 
Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?

大人 我一直对艾林家族尽诚竭节
My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.

无论是对令尊 令堂 还是现在的您
To your father, to your mother, and now to you.

你相信他吗 培提尔叔叔? 
Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?

罗伊斯大人竭力效忠谷地
Lord Royce has served the Vale well.

戎马多年 战绩彪炳
He's enjoyed a distinguished military career.

如果他的忠诚值得信任 那么在即将到来的征战中他仍是总司令的绝佳人选
If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.

您大可相信我的绝对忠诚 大人
You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.

我认为他值得一次机会 您觉得呢? 
I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?

我在北境的朋友告诉我珊莎・史塔克逃出了临冬城
My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

我估计她已经去往黑城堡了 她的哥哥在那里做总司令
I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander.

但她在那不安全 波顿正在追捕她
But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.

我的第一反应也是这个
That was my instinct as well.

集合谷地的骑士
Gather the Knights of the Vale.

加入战争的时候到了
The time has come to join the fray.

你把敌人请进了我们的城市? 
You invite the enemy into our city?

一位智者曾经告诉我
As a clever man once told me,

我不跟女王的敌人握手言和
I don't make peace with the queen's enemies.

我会杀死他们
I kill the queen's enemies.

对 那是军事手段
Yes, that's the military approach.

在弥林发挥了什么作用? 
And how has that worked here in Meereen?

我表达的是外交手段
I represent the diplomatic approach.

女王试过与伟主们言和 他们却想要杀她
Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.

我们谈判时留点神
We enter these negotiations with open eyes.

相信我 我近期的奴隶经历 已经告诉我这项制度有多可怕了
Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution.

您做了几天的奴隶呢? 
How many days were you a slave?

没有长到够你了解
Not long enough to understand.

我用一个辉币买了这个侏儒
I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.

不知何故你竟飞黄腾达 都住到弥林的大金字塔顶来了
And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

真让人称奇不已
It's most impressive.

现在你还代替阿斯塔波的善主发言呢
And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.

敬时来运转
Here's to reversals of fortune.

我们是来这觐见女王的 结果 迎接我们的是侏儒和太监
We came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.

让我们摊开了说吧 好吗? 说说你们想要什么
Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.

我们想要你们离开奴隶湾
We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.

带上你们的龙和雇佣兵 走人
Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.

丹妮莉丝女王不会永远待在弥林的
Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever.

她的目标在西方
Her path takes her westward.

我们上次见面的时候 我提出给她船只 这样她就可以回到属于她的维斯特洛 但她拒绝了
When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.

她拒绝了 是因为成千上万的 男人女人和孩子还活在链铐之下
She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.

他们自古以来就是如此
As they have since the dawn of time.

不再是了 你觉得你现在就是自由人了吗? 
Not anymore. You think you're a free man now?

你还是在遵令行事
You still follow orders.

你的主人有银发和奶子 并不意味着她就不是奴隶主
Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.

朋友 朋友 朋友 拜托
Friends, friends, friends, please.

世上总是有有钱有势的人和一无所有的人
There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing.

世界的规则就是这样 我不是来改变世界规则的
That is the way of the world. I'm not here to change the way of the world.

奴隶制就是我们世界的规则
Slavery is the way of our world.

你们不是非得用奴隶来赚钱
You don't need slaves to make money.

维斯特洛几百年来都没有奴隶 我却比你们中任何一个都富有
There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you.

不过 我们的女王却发现她错在 只是废除奴隶制 却没有提供一个新的体系来取代它
But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it.

所以这里是女王的提议
So here is the queen's proposal.

奴隶制永不回到弥林 但她会给奴隶湾的其他城市 一些时间来调整到新的秩序
Slavery will never return to Meereen, but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order.

废除奴隶制不必一夜完成 可以宽限到七年
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.

奴隶主将获得补偿 价格公道
Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices.

作为交换 你们要停止 对鹰身女妖之子的支持
In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.

鹰身女妖之子和我们无关
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.

好吧 随意了 总之你们会停止支持
Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.

我希望你们接受 朋友们
I do hope you accept, my friends.

你们不会得到更好的条件了
You will not receive a better offer.

让我们扬帆于自由之潮 而不是被它吞没
Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it.

我还给尊贵的客人们准备了点离别的礼物…
And as a parting gift to our honored guests...

给自由一个机会吧
Give freedom a chance.

它仍与从前一样甜美
See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.

要不我来替你作翻译吧
Perhaps I should translate for you.

我们会说通用语
We speak the Common Tongue.

真棒 今天你和奴隶贩子们见了面
Excellent. You met with the slavers today.

我们的兄弟姐妹们在和这些渣滓抗争的路上前仆后继
Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum.

而你现在却邀请他们登堂入室 共饮美酒
Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.

我想建筑这个大厅的目的 是让统治者威慑被统治者
I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.

但我不是你们的统治者
But I am not your ruler.

不是解放者
I'm not the Breaker of Chains.

更不是龙之母
And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.

你在这里只是一个陌生人
You are a stranger here.

凭什么代表弥林和我们的敌人进行谈判? 
So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?

因为我们的女王选择我作为她的顾问
Because our queen chose me as her advisor.

直到陛下旅途归来
Until she returns from her travels...

她什么时候才能回来? 
When does she return?

很快 我向你们保证
Soon. You have my word.

我们不认识你 更不信任你 我们熟知的是灰虫子
We don't know you. We don't trust you. We know Torgo Nudho.

我们随他抗击伟主 我们信任他
We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.

这正是灰虫子参与谈判的原因
And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.

作为无垢者军团的指挥官 他知道如何打败奴隶贩子 但他同样知道什么时候应该缔造和平
As commander of the Unsullied, he knows how to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.

你和那群奴隶贩子握手言和? 
You have made peace with the slavers?

不要搬我出来圆你的谎话 那些人尊重你
Do not use me for your lies. Those men respect you.

他们尊重我是因为他们对我知根知底
They respect me because they know who I am.

他们深知我的忠诚 我也一样
They know I am loyal. As do I.

我对女王陛下忠诚 而不是对你
I am loyal to my queen, not you.

如果你胆敢背叛她的事业 你就将是我之敌
If you betray her work, you are my enemy.

我没有背叛她的事业 我正试图挽救她的城市
I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.

你向奴隶主承诺他们可以保留奴隶制
You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.

七年对奴隶来说可不是什么短期
Seven years is not a short time for a slave.

奴隶制可怖 应当即刻根除
Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once.

战争可怖 应当马上停止
War is a horror that should be ended at once.

但我没法两头兼顾
I can't do both today.

你不该信任那些人
You are wrong to trust these men.

我信任的不是奴隶主 而是他们为自己打算的心思
I don't trust the Masters. I trust their selfinterest.

如果他们确信与我合作对他们自己有利 那他们就可以被相信
They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their selfinterest.

你不知道他们 你不了解他们
You don't know them. You don't understand them.

我们在他们眼里根本不是人
We are not human in their eyes.

当他们看向我 看到的是一把武器
They look at me and see a weapon.

当他们看向她 看到的是一个娼妓
They look at her and see a whore.

当他们看向我 看到的是一个畸形的小怪兽
They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.

他们的蔑视造就他们的弱点
Their contempt is their weakness.

他们会低估我们 而我们会利用这一点
They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.

他们不可能为你所用
You will not use them.

他们会利用你 这是他们的天性
They will use you. That is what they do.

何不坐下来喘口气呢? 
Why don't you sit and catch your breath?

我觉得你骑不了龙
I don't think you could ride the dragon.

别看她很娇小 你懂的 其实她很狂野
She's wild, you know. Don't let her size fool you.

我这么年轻都难以招架
It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man.

你呢 我担心你的心脏受不了
You, I don't think your heart could take it.

女王陛下选择了我一定让你非常不爽
Must make you angry that our queen chose me.

我很难过 过不了太久你就会辜负她
Makes me sad. You'll disappoint her before long.

她会忘了你 我们都好景不长
She'll move on. We'll all disappoint her before long.

现在我们需要彼此 当我们不再需要彼此的时候…
We need each other right now. After we're done needing each other...

喔 我可不想和你打 安达尔人乔拉
Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal.

我能有什么好处? 
What do I have to gain?

如果我赢了 我就成了干翻一个老家伙的草包
If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man.

万一我输了 我就成了被一个老家伙干翻的草包
If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man.

你小时候没受过多少管束 是吧? 
You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?

这条路直穿马门 他们叫它众神大道
The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway.

东市 西市
Eastern Market, Western Market.

卓戈卡奥死后 她本该来到这里 加入那些遗孀 成为多希卡林的一员
When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen the widows of the dead khals.

那就是他们要带她去的地方 多希卡林神庙
That's where they would have taken her the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

这座马族圣城禁止携带武器出入
It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.

难道潜入城中偷走他们的卡丽熙就不禁止吗? 
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?

如果他们发现了我们 而我们手无寸铁 我们就说我们是要去西市的商人
If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market.

但如果他们看到武器…
But if they see weapons...

你这是在要求一条狗交出它的牙
You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.

下面有十万人
There's 100,000 of them down there.

我们不能硬闯
We can't fight our way out.

我们等到天黑 然后找到她
We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.

这把刀和我有很深的羁绊
I'm very attached to this knife.

别担心 不会碰到你
Don't worry. It didn't touch you.

你知道这意味着什么? 
You know what happens?

我应该投胎成一个多斯拉克人的
I should have been born a Dothraki.

告诉过你这把刀和我的羁绊很深的
Told you, I'm very attached to this knife.

如果他们发现一具被捅死的尸体 全城的人都会出动搜查我们
If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us.

住手 不要伤害她 她会出卖我们
No, don't hurt her. She'll give us away.

我们不可能从维斯・多斯拉克活着出去
We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.

我们所能做的就是奋力一搏
All we can do is try.

我们所能做的比那多得多
We can do more than that.

而你们要助我一臂之力
And you're going to help me.

如果我现在让你离开 你会去哪里? 
If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?

你会去找寻什么? 
What would you seek out?

我会去见我的哥哥 我的丈夫 我的家人
I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family.

那是自然 但对你而言 这就意味着找寻金钱
Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money,

大麻雀 华服 权柄
总主教 finery, power.

找寻家人即是找寻罪恶
Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.

我并不是诋毁你
I'm not maligning you.

我也曾追寻那些东西
I sought those things out, too.

重视他们超过一切
To the exclusion of all else.

我父亲是鞋匠
My father was a cobbler.

他在我年轻时去世  我继承了他的店
He died when I was young and I took over his shop.

他是个简单的人  做的鞋也很简便
He was a simple man and he made simple shoes.

可是我后来发现  我在制鞋上的功夫用的越多 卖的也就越好
But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them.

上好的皮革 装饰 细节设计以及花费的时间
Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time.

花去几十个钟头来制作一双鞋
Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.

我估计你一直都穿着某人花去一整年时间 所制成的鞋
I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back.

贵族喜欢用我的生命去呵护他们的脚 而且他们对此也给予丰厚的报酬
The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege.

我用他们给的钱 去为自己购买机会 享受他们那种生活
I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself.

每当我沉溺于此
Each time I indulged,

我都能感觉自己变得更好了
I felt myself ascending to something better.

后有某日汝穿过墓园 顿悟世事皆为浮云 乃下决心追逐正义
And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness.

陌客之书, 第 25 节
Book of the Stranger, verse 25.

你知道《七星圣经》? 
You know 'The SevenPointed Star.'

乌尼亚修女给我读过   她无时不刻不在读
Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.

是的  是的  她确实喜欢对人宣讲
Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people.

不过那不是墓园
But it wasn't a graveyard.

我买了好酒陈酿 还有很多年轻漂亮的女孩 邀请朋友们前来 一起分享
I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come and share it all.

我们分享美酒  分享女人 陷入了恍惚状态
We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor.

几乎不能站直身
I could barely stand.

其他所有人都在长椅或者地上睡着 乱七八糟地睡在他们昂贵的衣服旁边
Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.

他们的身体一览无余
The truth of their bodies laid bare.

我可以闻到他们 透过熏香和香水 还有美味佳肴已经开始变质的味道
I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn.

我非常清晰地看到了这一切
And I saw it with perfect clarity.

我看到了我的罪
I saw what my sins were.

我拥有的金子  我喝过的酒  我上过的女人 我为保住地位而做出的不懈努力
The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.

这都成了故事的一部分
It was all part of a story.

一个我用来告诫自己'我是谁? '的故事
A story I was telling myself about who I was.

一个在光明之下无所遁形的 谎言的集合
A collection of lies that would disappear in the light.

那些我曾避之唯恐不及的人 街上的乞丐 穷苦人 他们比曾经的我更加接近真实
The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.

我离开过去的生活 前去找寻他们
I left to go and find them.

我甚至连鞋都没穿
I didn't even put on my shoes.

我走出了门就再也没回去
I walked out the door and never went back.

来吧  我们去看看他
Come, let's go and see him.

你必须保持坚强
You need to stay strong.

你是我们家族的未来 我们血脉的未来
You are the future of our house, the future of our family.

我才不在乎那个
I don't care about that.

你难道... 你难道告诉他们那个了? 
Have you... have you told them that?

我只想一切停下来
I just want it to stop.

他们想让我帮你
They want me to help you.

他们想让我帮忙  把你逼疯
They want me to help tear you down.

这就是为什么他让我来看你  我知道会是这样
That's why he's letting me see you. I know it is.

如果我们之中谁屈从于他们  他们就赢了
And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.

在当前的窘境下 如何避免灾难的降临
And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament.

陛下  我应付过各种各样的狂信徒
I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace.

不要激怒他们  这是最重要的事情
Not setting them off, that's the most important thing.

你已经深陷内部和外部的敌人包围了
You are beset with enemies both within and without.

你在这里做什么? 
What are you doing here?

我就当前的窘境来给国王提供谏言
I am advising the king on our current predicament.

出去  我可是御前重臣
Leave. I am a member of the small council.

这是御前会议吗? 
Is this a small council meeting?

我来这是奉献我的智慧和支持
I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.

感谢你的谏言  国师
Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester.

今天就到此为止吧
That will be all for now.

鉴于我错过了之前多次御前会议
Since I've missed the past several small council meetings,

我想与你讨论几件事
I wanted to speak to you about a few things.

我一直在思考大麻雀
I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.

彼此彼此 真不幸
As have we all, unfortunately.

我们和这样一个人打交道时必须小心
We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.

避免事态进一步升级
To prevent things from escalating any further.

避免与其敌对
We have to be careful not to antagonize him.

他手上押着玛格丽  我们不能拿她冒险
He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk.

他很危险  看着我
He's dangerous. Look at me.

他们对我做了什么? 
What did they do to me?

对国王的亲生母亲? 
To the king's own mother?

已经过去了  成了过去时
It's done. It's in the past.

玛格丽的安全是第一位的
Margaery's safety is paramount.

你不喜欢玛格丽  对吧? 
You don't like Margaery, do you?

我喜不喜欢她根本无关紧要
Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.

玛格丽是王后
Margaery is the queen.

王后要有尊严  国王更须如此
Queens must command respect. Kings even more so.

这不仅仅是为了他们  更是为了所有人
Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's.

大麻雀对国王和王后没有尊重
The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.

对世上任何事情都没有尊重
No respect for anything in this world.

他根本不在乎世上的一切存在
He has no use for the things of this world.

他想将一切扳倒  然后用什么来取而代之? 
He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?

用街上的乞丐
With beggars in the street.

母亲… 有些事我想告诉您
Mother...  there's something I want to tell you.

大麻雀告诉我的事
Something the High Sparrow told me.

你和他谈过了? 
You've spoken with him?

我答应过他不会告诉任何人  如果他发现我…
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told...

那就是他不会轻易饶恕的泄密行为了 瞧瞧他天天宣讲做人的真实
It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth.

你永远可以信任我
You can always trust me.

根据国王陛下的命令 御前会议推迟举行
The small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.

我还以为我们第一次会面时已经说得很清楚了
I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time.

你在这里不受欢迎  你说过你尊重我们的父亲 是因为他懂得和对手一起共事的重要性
You're not welcome. You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.

亲爱的  你已经毫无尊严和权威可言 公开羞辱 然后软禁在红堡
My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publically shamed, and confined to the Red Keep.

还有什么共事的资本? 
What's left to work with?

瑟曦是国王的母亲
Cersei is the mother of the king.

国王肯听她的意见 也信任她
She has the king's ear and his trust.

并且国王最近经常和大麻雀一起讨论 玛格丽王后和洛拉斯爵士
And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

大麻雀能够攫取权力 正因为看透了我们只会在内部争吵而不是将其夺回
The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back.

下场如此  我们真不赖
Here we are. Well done to us.

现在七国的未来 全操于他肮脏的农民之手
Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rests in his dirty peasant hands.

几天后  他将对我进行审判
In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.

不过在此之前  玛格丽王后要先进行赎罪之旅
But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement.

是的  玛格丽将要当着全城的善男信女的面 忏悔罪行
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.

不会发生
That will not happen.

你有维斯特洛大陆第二多的军队
You've got the second largest army in Westeros.

你将带他们进城 在玛格丽王后被羞辱之前阻止它发生 并将她带回王宫监护
You'll bring them into the city, stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.

为了王后的安全 国王已命我不要采取任何针对大麻雀 或教团武装的行动
The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.

你无需行动
You will take no action at all.

当提利尔军队来的时候  你让开就是
When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down.

国王的命令严格要求您不能让开吗? 
Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?

是的  不过如果国王…
No, but if the king should call...

整个事件将在任何人要求你做任何事情之前结束
The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.

那时大麻雀已被监禁 最好是死了 玛格丽已回到托曼身边 你觉得国王会对结果生气吗? 
When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?

你和我们一样讨厌这些狂信徒
You hate these fanatics as much as we do.

你恨他们对你儿子的所作所为
You hate what they've done to your son.

你想要蓝塞尔回来吗? 
Do you want Lancel back?

还是说你已经彻底放弃他了? 
Or have you given him up for good?

我当然想要他回来
Of course I want him back.

那就让开吧 让那些将他从你身边夺走的人付出代价
Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.

如果一切没有按计划进行 麻雀们在城里有很多盟友
If it doesn't go as planned, the sparrows have many friends in this city.

内战将会爆发   很多人会死
We'll have civil war. Many will die.

无论我们做什么都会有很多人死去
Many will die no matter what we do.

他们说你回来了 我不信
They told me you were home and I didn't believe it.

我说 '席恩・葛雷乔伊吗? '
'Theon Greyjoy?' I said.

好多人为了救你而死
Men died trying to rescue you.

你是个被宠坏了的混蛋 但你是我弟弟 我为你赌上了一切 你却背叛了我
You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.

我知道 我知道 我对不起你
I know. I know and I'm sorry.

他让我崩溃成了无数碎片
He broke me into 1,000 pieces.

我知道 你不知道
I know. You don't know.

他送了一片给我们
He sent us one of those pieces.

所以我才去救你
That's why I came for you.

你为什么回来
Why did you come here?

我还有什么地方可去? 
Where else could I go?

你听到父亲死了 就想回来争夺王位吗? 
You heard Father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown?

不 不是的  入港之后我才知道他去世了
No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.

恰好在选王会之前回到派克岛? 
You happen to show up on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?

你觉得你搞了那些事情出来后 还会有铁民想要拥戴你? 
You think any ironborn wants you to be king after what you've done?

我不想当国王
I don't want to be king.

我应该听你的话 你是唯一一个…
I should have listened to you. You're the only one...

无所谓了 别哭了
That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying.

告诉我你到底想要什么
Tell me what you want.

你应该统治铁群岛
You should rule the Iron Islands.

他们把你收拾得挺干净
They've cleaned you up nicely.

你见过我的家徽吗? 
You've seen my banners?

你害怕吗? 
Does that worry you at all?

我可是见过人吃人
Then I've seen worse.

你服侍过史塔克家? 
You served the Starks?

是的 他们用链子锁着我 拿剑抵在我的喉咙上 所以我服侍他们
Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I served them.

史塔克家族覆灭已久 但你一直保护着瑞肯
The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.

找得到合适的买家 他能卖个好价钱
He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer.

我服侍他家族那么久
I served his family a long time.

依我看 这是他们欠我的
Way I see it, I'm owed.

瑞肯再也不是你可以卖的了
Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.

所以你现在还有什么用呢? 
So what use could I possibly have for you?

我可以给你你想要的
I can give you what you want.

你真的知道我想要什么吗? 
And you're sure you know what that is?

男人都想要一个东西
Same thing men always want.

男人想要的时候 就会先给她洗个澡
And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.

你真会说话
You're a good talker.

你比席恩・葛雷乔伊会说多了
You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.

让他开口说话真费劲
I had to work hard to get him talking.

他什么都说了
He told me everything.

史塔克家男孩们的一切 谁帮他们逃跑 她是怎么帮的
All about the Stark boys, who helped them escape, and how she did it.

吃的不好 抱歉
Sorry about the food.

我们可不以美食闻名
It's not what we're known for.

没关系 你们有更重要的事
That's all right. There are more important things.

你的信 总司令大人
A letter for you, Lord Commander.

我已经不是总司令了
I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

叛徒及野种琼恩・雪诺

你让数以千计的野人越过了绝境长城
You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall.

你背叛了自己人

你背叛了北境
You have betrayed the North.

临冬城是我的 野种 来看看吧
Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see.

你弟弟瑞肯在我的地牢里
Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

他的冰原狼的皮铺在我的地板上

来看看吧 我要我的新娘
Come and see. I want my bride back.

交出她 野种 我便不找你或你的野人朋友们的麻烦
Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers.

如若不肯 我会向北进军 大肆屠戮 所有在你庇护之下的野人 不管是男人 女人或小孩
Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection.

我会当着你的面活剥他们 我会…
You will watch as I skin them living. You... '

都是类似的话
It's just more of the same.

让你眼睁睁地看着我的士兵轮奸你的妹妹
'You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister.

我会让你眼睁睁的看着我的狗 吃了你狂野的幼弟
You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother.

然后我会挖出你的眼睛 剩下的留给我的狗
Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

来看看吧 拉姆斯・波顿 临冬城公爵和 北境守护
Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.'

临冬城公爵和北境守护
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

现在他手里还有瑞肯 我们不能确定
And now he has Rickon. We don't know that.

他有多少兵? 
How many men does he have in his army?

他说起史坦尼斯的进攻时 提到有五千人
I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.

你有多少人? 
How many do you have?

能行军打仗的? 
That can march and fight?

剩下的是小孩和老人
The rest are children and old people.

你是真正的北境守护之子
You're the son of the last true Warden of the North.

北境家族都很忠诚 只要你要求 他们会和你并肩战斗
Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.

那个魔鬼抢走了我们的家 我们的弟弟
A monster has taken our home and our brother.

我们必须回到临冬城 把他们都抢回来
We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.

鼹鼠村离这多远? 
How far is Mole's Town?

听说您逃出临冬城 我万分惊惧
When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.

见您毫发无损 我欣喜至极
You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.

你来这做什么? 
What are you doing here?

我率谷地的骑士北上 前来救援
I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid.

此刻他们正在卡林湾扎营
They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.

If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

如果你了解 你就是我的敌人
If you did know, you're my enemy.

他需要我这张脸 奈德・史塔克之女的这张脸
He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

但对我身体的其余部分 他肆意妄为 只要我还能为他生出继承人
But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir.

你觉得他做了什么? 
What do you think he did?

我无法想象…
I can't begin to contemplate...

你觉得他对我做了什么? 
What do you think he did to me?

珊莎夫人在问你问题
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

是的 他很享受
Yes, he enjoyed that.

你觉得他还做了什么? 
What else do you think he did?

珊莎 我… 还有什么? 
Sansa, I... What else?

看来你的确一直很了解拉姆斯啊我不了解
Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along. I didn't know.

我还以为你知道所有人的秘密呢
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

我犯了一个错误 可怕的错误
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

我低估了一个陌生人
I underestimated a stranger.

他做的其它事 都是夫人小姐们无法说出口的 却会是妓院老板们永远的谈资
The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.

不是说它依然能刺痛我柔软的内心
I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.

而是此刻站在这里我仍能感受到他对我的身体做了什么
I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.

你说过会保护我
You said you would protect me.

You might consider seeking him out.

将来您也许需要一支忠诚的军队
The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.

趁还来得及 你应该赶紧回家去

最早的无面者没有谁是贵族出身

他们最初都是瓦雷利亚矿井中的奴隶
They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.

千面之神教会他如何褪去面容 如何送出馈赠

他们建立了自由城邦布拉佛斯和这座黑白之院

我感到的凛冬的寒风吹过大地
I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land.

吾儿将孤身坐上冰冷的王座 无人扶助
And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand.

何人教他君临天下? 何人教他自信优雅? 
Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace?

当他需板起面孔 何人可以求助? 
To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?

奈德・史塔克会教他 现在接着给我倒酒
Ned Stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.

这里发生了什么? 
What's happened here, then?

奈德・史塔克 他找你来
He brought you here, Ned Stark,

因你是最智慧之人

汝将为王 而吾为汝之首相
You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.

我们北境人都是一把好手 让人们把法纪遵守
We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.

我寻求他的准许 他却闻起来一股恶臭
I'd ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.

如今吾只有卧躺于斯
And here I now must lie.

哦 吾将死
Oh, I am about to go.

你是否愿继续出任乔佛里的首相
Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?

铁王座才是我所求

你不会的我会

继承的顺位 那有什么意义? 
The line of succession. What's that mean?

正当的程序 那又有什么关系? 
The proper progression. What's that mean?

合法的登基  那算什么玩意? 
The lawful ascension. What's that mean?

快滚开 还我属于我的王座 不然我找你麻烦
So move along, give me my chair and there won't be no more trouble.

我们曾有凿凿共识
But we had a deal all done and dusted.

如今我看你不可信任

我将用欲望来填

忘掉你的悲惨处境 来把我们的新婚之夜排演
So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.

是疣子 两个疣子

我那玩意儿上长了两个疣子
I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

不用担心 亲 过个五六年就消了
Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.

哦 亲爱的 把这件洗了 已经臭了

亲爱的 你能做的更好 比安卡 你一定会的

昨晚你可没抱怨我
You weren't complaining about me last night.

来点葡萄酒吗 克连恩夫人? 
May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?

我是只喝朗姆酒的 博博诺
I'm a rum girl, Bobono.

如果你还想更亲密 就得知道这些
You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.

我们当然会更亲密
Of course we're going to be intimate.

只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time.

愿他们有你的才华

和你肮脏的心灵
And your filthy mind.

女孩会在朗姆酒里下毒
A girl will poison the rum.

只有克连恩夫人喝朗姆酒
Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.

如果女孩能用大厅里的某个面孔…
If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall...

她是个好演员
She's a good actress.

她看上去像个好人
Seems like a decent woman.

难道只有坏人会死吗? 
Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?

不重要 代价已付讫
That does not matter. The price was paid.

她因为克连恩夫人比她好而心生嫉妒
She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.

女孩必须决定她是不是要侍奉千面之神

侍奉之人不问问题

我们遭到屠杀
We were being slaughtered.

圣树被砍伐

我们必须保护自己

我们在淹神的注视下起誓

以淹神的名义在此集合 选出一位新国王来领导我们

我是亚拉・葛雷乔伊 铁群岛之王巴隆・葛雷乔伊
I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

的女儿
King of the Iron Islands.

我欲登王座
I claim the Salt Throne.

我们从来没有过女王 从来没有
We've never had a queen. Not once.

我们从没做过的事情多了
There are many things we've never done.

我们从未扬名于世
We've never made our mark upon the world.

除了我们的劫掠船队在他们的地盘四处剽掠的时候 那些维斯特洛的王公贵族们对我们从来嗤之以鼻 等到他们觉得烦了
The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance.

就来攻打我们
Then they swat us down.

征服我们 羞辱我们 随后扬长而去重又对我们视而不见
They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.

我们是海上民族  对!
We are a sea people. Aye!

海神才是我们的神  对!
Our god is a sea god. Aye!

我若为女王 将打造一支舰队…
When I am queen, we will build a fleet that...

你成不了女王! 我还没有说完!
You shall not be queen! I am not finished!

不 你已经说完了! 女人没法领导我们
Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.

更何况巴隆的嫡子已经重回铁群岛
Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.

我是席恩・葛雷乔伊… 巴隆・葛雷乔伊仅存的儿子
I am Theon Greyjoy...  last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

她才该是你们的统治者
And she is your rightful ruler.

在这儿有好些人 曾在她的指挥下扬帆出海 你们知道她是什么样的 没错!
Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is. Aye!

她是个掠夺者 对!
She is a reaver. Aye!

她是个战士 对!
She is a warrior. Aye!

我们没有更好的人选了
We will find no better leader.

我亦欲登王座
I claim the Salt Throne.

听说你把一切都搞砸了
Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground.

拿下了一个根本守不住的城堡
Captured a castle you couldn't keep.

最后自己成了俘虏
Got yourself taken prisoner.

甚至谣传说你下面没了
Even heard you have no cock.

难怪你觉得女人可以当王
Explains why you think a woman can be king.

你什么时候回来的 叔叔
When did you return, Uncle?

要做一些
I had some things to take care of.

很高兴你能来
I'm glad you're here.

我现在知道登上大位之后当做的第一件事是什么了
Now I know what my first act as queen will be.

将杀父仇人枭首
To execute the man who killed my father.

在索桥上把他扔了下去 看着他掉下去
Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall.

跟着他没有出路 如果不是我杀了他 没有出路的日子还将继续
He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.

没人爱戴他了 没人愿意追随他了
No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him.

他将我们带入了两场毫无胜算的仗
He led us into two wars we couldn't win.

我很抱歉没早点杀了他
I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.

你想杀也杀不了
That would have been hard to do.

我最后一次听到你的消息是你在优哉游哉周游世界
Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.

你下面没了就学着这么说话了吗? 
That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?

是不是维斯特洛的老爷们教你这么说话的? 
Did the great lords of Westeros teach you words like that?

成长为铁种 领导铁种
Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.

时刻准备着带领我们寻回荣耀
Getting ready to bring us back to glory.

她又要怎么做到呢? 
And how will she do that?

我会打造一支有史以来最大的舰队
I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.

不错不错 只不过我才是打造铁舰队的那个人 因为只有我知道该怎样利用这支舰队
Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it.

我周游过世界
I've been all over the world.

你们的见识加起来也比不上我
I've seen more of it than all of you combined.

这海的对面 有一位人物 她和我们一样痛恨维斯特洛的贵族老爷
And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.

她有一支大军 有三条龙 却没有个丈夫
Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband.

我将会打造这支舰队 然后我要优哉游哉地过去 把这支舰队交到丹妮莉丝・坦格利安手中 外加我的这杆长枪
I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.

你想去勾引龙女王? 
You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?

不用我勾引 这支舰队会让她上钩
I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

然后我就和她一起夺占七国
And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.

我不是天生的国王
I wasn't born to be king.

但我已经付了 登上王位的铁钱
I paid the iron price and here I stand.

攸伦 ! 攸伦 ! 攸伦 ! 攸伦 !
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

攸伦 ! 攸伦 ! 攸伦 ! 攸伦 !
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

让您的仆人 攸伦 如您一般自海中重生
May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.

给予他海盐的祝福 给与他坚石的祝福
Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone.

给予他钢铁的祝福
Bless him with steel.

倾听海浪 倾听神灵
Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.

他晓谕我等 只当拥立攸伦・葛雷乔伊为王
He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.

愿海洋洗去你的愚蠢和虚浮
Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away.

让攸伦的旧驱壳受淹
Let the old Euron drown.

让海水充盈他的肺
Let his lungs fill with seawater.

让海鱼嗫去他的眼睑
Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

逝者不死 必将再起 其势更烈
What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

我的侄子侄女在哪儿? 
Where are my niece and nephew?

让我们去杀掉他们
Let's go murder them.

他们偷走了我们最好的船
They stole our best ships.

带走多少也救不了他们
Won't be enough to save them.

回到你们的领地去
Go back to your homes.

见树就砍
Chop down every tree you can find.

锯好木材就开工造船
Quartersaw the timber and start building.

每一个男人都来给我打造甲板
I want every man bending planks.

每一个女人都来给我编织帆布
I want every woman spinning flax for sails.

为我打造一千条长船 我会给你们整个世界
Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.

我放逐了你两次
I banished you twice.

然后你救了我的命
And you saved my life.

所以我既不能接纳你 也不能赶你走
So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.

你必须赶我走
You must send me away.

还剩多少时间? 
How long does it take?

我也不知道
I don't know that either.

但我见过它恶化后的样子
But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.

在那之前 我会把事情了结
I'll end things before that.

我唯一想要的就是为您效命
All I've ever wanted was to serve you.

提利昂・兰尼斯特是对的
Tyrion Lannister was right.

我会永远爱你
I'll always love you.

不要背弃你的女王
Do not walk away from your queen,

我还没有遣散你
You have not been dismissed.

你发誓效忠于我
You pledged yourself to me.

你发誓一生遵从我的命令
You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.

那么我命令你找到解药 天涯海角也在所不辞
Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world.

我命令你治愈自己 再回到我身边
I command you to heal yourself and then return to me.

当我征服七大王国时
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

我需要你在我身边
I need you by my side.

和奴隶主们签订合约后的半个月里 鹰身女妖之子杀了多少人? 
In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?

自由人杀了多少奴隶主呢? 
And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?

两个 不过都是在签订合约当天
Two, but that was the day of the pact.

所以不过分地说 脆弱的和平已经达成
So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.

'暂时'是我们目前能得到的最好结果
For now is the best we get in our profession.

考虑到城市之前已经处在内战边缘
Considering the city was on the brink of civil war,

这算是个不错的开始啊
I'd say it's a good start.

他们不仅仅需要知道弥林已经和平
It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.

更要知道是丹妮莉丝造就的和平
They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.

鹰身女妖之子有个好故事
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

抵抗外来入侵者
Resist the foreign invaders.

我们的女王有个更好的故事
Our queen has an even better story.

龙之母, 解放者… 所有这些
Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains... all that.

人们知道是谁带给他们自由的
The people know who brought them freedom.

没错 但他们知道是谁带给他们安全吗
Yes, but do they know who brought them security?

是谁终结了暴力? 
Who brought about an end to the violence?

我们需要一个人们信任的人 一个他们知道不可能被收买或被影响的人
We need someone the people trust, someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.

听上去是个大英雄啊 我们上哪儿去找他? 
Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?

谁说是'他'了
Who said anything about 'him'?

这大概是我瓦雷利亚语的极限了
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

感谢您远道至此
Thank you for travelling all this way.

我亲身体会过这趟旅途有多么令人不适
I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.

事实是 我们需要您的帮助
The truth is we need your help.

我们希望可以劝说您…
We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to...

你无需劝说我
You don't need to persuade me.

风暴降生丹妮莉丝是预言中的王子
Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised.

她从火焰中重生 将重塑这个世界
From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.

她打破了奴隶们的铁链 将罪恶的奴隶主们钉上十字架
She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.

她的龙是火焰化身的血肉 是光之王的礼物
Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light.

但这些你都听过 不是吗? 
But you heard all of this before, haven't you?

在瓦兰提斯的长桥上
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

巨龙会净化成千上万的异端 把他们的罪恶和肉体焚烧殆尽
The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.

理想情况下 我们不想净化过多的异端
Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers.

龙之母有很多不同信仰的追随者
The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.

你想要你的女王被崇拜和服从
You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.

在她缺席期间 你还想要她的顾问们 被崇拜和服从
And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.

服从就够了
I'd settle for obeyed.

我会召来我最有说服力的祭司们
I will summon my most eloquent priests.

他们会把我的话散播出去
They will spread the word.

丹妮莉丝被派来带领人民对抗黑暗 不仅是这场战争 还有未来的大战
Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.

听起来很棒
That sounds most excellent.

你们的一个红袍女祭司曾宣称 被选中的是一个叫史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩的人
A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.

他同样怀有伟大使命
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

结果他进军君临 被打得落花流水 打败他的人就是我身边这位
He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me.

上次我听说 他又被打败了 这次是在临冬城 他彻底歇菜了
Last I had heard, he had been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.

我们对您能提供给女王的任何支持都表示感谢
We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.

我想身为狂热者的人 应该很难承认错误
I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake.

这不正是狂信徒的意义所在吗? 
Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?

一切都是真主的旨意
Everything is the Lord's will.

一切都是真主的旨意
Everything is the Lord's will.

但是凡人都可能会犯错误
But men and women make mistakes.

即便是光之王的忠仆也在所难免
Even honest servants of the Lord.

所以您呢 光之王的忠仆 我们如何相信您知道的 比谏言史坦尼斯的那位更多? 
And you, an honest servant of the Lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

我的朋友对信仰怀有一些合理的疑惑 然而我们都是女王陛下忠诚的支持者
My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.

每个人变成什么样子 身处何地 都是有原因的
Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason.

可怕的事情发生也有原因
Terrible things happen for a reason.

比如幼年时期发生在你身上的事 瓦里斯大人
Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child.

如果你没有在一个二流术士手上被阉割 你怎会在这里帮助真主的选民将光明带给世界? 
If not for your mutilation at the hand of a secondrate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lord's Chosen bring his light into the world.

知识让你变得强大
Knowledge has made you powerful.

但是你不知道的事情还太多太多
But there's still so much you don't know.

你还记得那天晚上听到了什么 当术士将你那话儿扔进火中的时候? 
Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire?

你听到了火焰中的声音 还记得吗? 
You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember?

要我告诉你那声音说了什么吗? 
Should I tell you what the voice said?

要我告诉你发出声音的是谁吗? 
Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?

我们效忠同一个女王
We serve the same queen.

如果你是她真正的朋友 就无需怕我
If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.

他看见我了 夜王!
He saw me, the Night King!

他看见我了! 他碰了你
He saw me! He touched you.

我不知道 他离我很近 但是…
I don't know. He was close, but...

他知道你在这 他会来找你
He knows you are here. He'll come for you.

现在他可以了 他已经标记了你
He can now. His mark is on you.

你必须离开 你们全部
You must leave, all of you.

过来 阿多 帮我准备雪橇
Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

对不起 我不是故意的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

是时候了 什么时候? 
The time has come. The time for what?

你成为我的时候
For you to become me.

我们不能一边从北面抵御异鬼
We can't defend the north from the walkers

临冬城
(波顿)

史塔克家族 一边从南面抵御波顿
(黑城堡) and the south from the Boltons.

我们需要临冬城 而想拿下临冬城 我们需要更多人手
If we want to survive, we need Winterfell and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

除了史塔克和波顿 北境最有势力的家族是 安柏家族 卡史塔克家族 还有曼德勒家族
Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.

安柏家族和卡史塔克家族 已宣布效忠波顿家族 所以我们这里的情况不太妙
The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there.

安柏家把瑞肯交给了我们的敌人 他们都该被绞死
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang.

但卡史塔克家宣誓效忠拉姆斯时 并不知道他们还有其他选择
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.

对不起 夫人 但他们知道史塔克家砍了他们族长的头
I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father.

我不觉得还能指望他们
I don't think we can count on them either.

你对北境有多了解呢 戴佛斯爵士
How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?

几乎不了解 夫人
Precious little, my lady.

我父亲总说 北境人与众不同
My father always said Northerners are different.

更忠实 对外人更猜忌
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

他们或许忠实 但当波顿背叛你的家族时 又有多少人敢站出来对抗他们呢? 
They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family?

我可能不了解北境 但我了解人性
I may not know the North, but I know men.

无论在世界的哪个角落 他们基本是一样的 哪怕最勇敢的人也不想看着 自己的妻儿因战败被剥皮
They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.

琼恩要想说服他们并肩作战 就要让他们知道我们有赢的把握
If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win.

北境不止有三个家族…
There are more than three other houses in the North...

葛洛佛 莫尔蒙 赛文
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

二十多个 加在一起足以和其他人抗衡
Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others.

我们可以积少成多
We can start small and build.

他们不会遗忘史塔克这个姓氏
They remember the Stark name.

从白港到拉姆斯的门前 一定有人仍愿意为史塔克付出一切
People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

但琼恩并不姓史塔克
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

琼恩就是奈德・史塔克的儿子 好比拉姆斯是卢斯・波顿的儿子
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

还有很多徒利家的人 他们虽然不是北境人 但仍会毫不犹豫的支持我们对抗波顿
And there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.

我不知道徒利家还有军队
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

我外叔祖父黑鱼重组军队 夺回了奔流城
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.

你怎么知道的? 
How do you know that?

在我逃离临冬城前 拉姆斯收到渡鸦带来的消息
Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.

黑鱼是个传奇
The Blackfish is a legend.

他的支持对我们而言意义重大
His support would mean a great deal.

史塔克 徒利 加上其他家族 总算看起来有些胜算了
Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.

我发过誓要保护你 夫人
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

你听到了 我们需要更多人手 而我外叔祖父有支军队
You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.

我们可以给黑鱼送只渡鸦
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

被拉姆斯截获的话就完了
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.

骑马去奔流城 我外叔祖父会和你谈的 你也知道怎么跟他说
Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.

我不想把你单独留在这
I don't like leaving you here alone.

不是他 他看上去很可靠
Not him. He seems trustworthy.

可能有点阴郁
A bit brooding, perhaps.

不过考虑到他的经历 也可以理解
I suppose that's understandable, considering.

戴佛斯和红袍女是某人谋杀亲弟弟的共谋 使用血魔法
Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with bloodmagic.

而当史坦尼斯为自己的罪行付出代价时 他们在哪儿? 
And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they?

已经离开他 去寻找更有前途的领头人了
Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.

还有那个留着络腮胡的野人…
And that wildling fellow with the beard...

琼恩不是托蒙德 他不是戴佛斯 也不是红袍女 他也不是史坦尼斯 琼恩就是琼恩
Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.

他是我哥哥 他会保护我的 我相信他
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.

那他问你怎么知道奔流城的事的时候 你为什么要骗他? 
Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?

我自己做的 你喜欢吗? 
I made it myself. Do you like it?

是的 它很…  我喜欢这个狼的刺绣

我从没想到过我还会回到这 我父亲已经逼我放弃了爵位和继承权 呃 还威胁我 不那么做的话就杀了我
I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.

那时我就是个不受欢迎的人
A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.

我也压根没想到会把这小家伙介绍给我的家人
And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.

那么你应该知道怎样跟他们说
So you know what to tell them.

就说小山姆是你的孩子
That Little Sam is your baby.

对  这很重要
Yes, now that's very important.

如果他认同小山姆是他的孙子 那他就会接受你
If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in.

他会有人教导 识字读书
He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.

你也可以帮着教他 对吧? 
And you can help teach him. Huh?

你都给你家人说了我的哪些情况? 
What did you tell your family about me?

我告诉他们我在北境遇到了你
I told them I met you in the North.

说了有多北么? 
Did you tell them how far north?

呃 信里面写不下那么多
Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.

你没告诉他们我真正的家乡? 
You didn't tell them where I'm really from?

没说我是个野人? 
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

问题是… 我父亲不喜欢野人
The thing is...  my father doesn't like wildlings.

他希望我能够像男人一样'去杀掉混蛋野人' 所以这是一个尽可能要避免的话题
He hoped I'd make a man of myself by 'killing some bloody wildlings,' so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.

我… 觉得我们到了
I... think we're here.

我以为再也见不到你了
I never thought I'd see you again.

天呐 真是女大十八变
Gods, you're a woman now.

你很怕她出事? 
You're afraid for her?

我当然怕她出事!

教团武装对那些 越界的人非常严厉
The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds.

而且玛格丽王后和你母亲不同
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

我觉得诸神可能会引导人们 对她礼貌以待
I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf.

她确实对他们敞开了真心
She's truly opened her heart to them.

她一直都致力于帮助那些贫穷和不幸的人们
She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.

而且她现在也笃信诸神
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.

您想见见她么?

很快就是… 救赎之路
Soon the...  walk of atonement.

他说了没有别的办法
He says there's no other way.

你跟他谈过吗 跟大麻雀? 
Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?

他也不完全就是我们认为的那样  是吧? 
He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?

你… 你永远不会
You... you could never.

你说得对 他不是
You're right, he's not.

他有些不一样的经历
There's something about him.

他看这个世界的方式
His way of looking at the world.

承认真实的自我到底是什么确实不是一件简单的事情
It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.

What are you talking about?

你是个好人 你一直都是好人
You're a good person. You've always been a good person.

你是我所知道的最好的人
You're the best person I know.

我只是告诉他你对穷人的帮助
I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.

啊  是的  我去过他们的住处 喂他们喝汤  确保别人看到我做过这些事情
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.

但是 我从来都没有给过他们真正需要的东西
I never gave them what they really needed, though.

我想了很久 想到我给自己装扮上多么好看的伪装
I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.

我给自己讲的那些故事 关于我是谁 我为什么要做这些事
All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did.

那些故事里面有太多的谎言
There were so many lies in those stories.

没事 真没什么
It's all right. It really is.

卸下伪装就像卸下负担
It's such a relief to let go of those lies.

永远都爱
I will always love my brother.

他的灵魂纯洁而完美
His soul is pure and perfect.

他的罪抹不去那种纯净 只是遮蔽了它
His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.

他只是需要 为他们赎罪

或早或晚 必有一劫
Sooner or later, one way or another.

我们从七十码外的地方
Brought it down from 70 yards.

哦 那… 那可真是够远的
Oh, that's... that's a fair distance.

你在长城的时候经常打猎吗? 
So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?

在长城以北的地方 你不打猎就没得吃
North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat.

猎物大多是鹿吧? 也是麋鹿? 
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

我说的'我们'主要是指我和我朋友琼恩
I say 'we,' it's my friend Jon mostly.

她… 她也是个相当棒的猎手
She's... she's quite a good hunter as well.

我觉得在你的家乡这应该挺常见的
I imagine it's common where you're from.

我们遇到过最后壁炉城的安柏大人 对吧 蓝道 他说他教自己所有的女儿打猎
We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.

你父亲教你打猎的? 
Your father taught you to hunt?

我们的父亲可永远都不会这么做
Our father would never teach us.

我猜没准他能从你父亲身上学点东西
I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.

到此为止
That's enough of that.

山姆威尔 你还想再来点面包吗? 
Samwell, would you care for more bread?

哦 是的 要的 谢谢
Oh, yes. Yes, please.

你还嫌自己不够胖吗? 
Not fat enough already?

我是奉总司令大人的命令来到南方的
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.

他想让我…   我读了你的信
He wants me to...  I read your letter.

你想要当学士
You're to be a maester.

一旦我拥有了自己的颈链
And once I have my chain,

便会回到黑城堡
I'll return to Castle Black.

我以为守夜人会把你变成一个真男人
I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.

至少也该有点男人的模样
Something resembling a man at least.

结果你却依旧如此软弱 胖得不行
You managed to stay soft and fat.

就知道一头扎进书堆
Your nose buried in books.

一辈子都在阅读更优秀的人所取得的成就
Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.

我敢打赌你还是骑不上马 挥不动剑
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.

蓝道 成为守夜人的学士是很高的荣誉
Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.

他能挥剑
He can wield a sword.

还杀死过一个异鬼
He killed a white walker.

根本没有异鬼这种东西
There's no such thing.

在南下黑城堡的路上 我亲眼所见
I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.

他把一柄匕首捅进了异鬼的心脏
He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.

他不止一次冒着生命危险救我
He risked his own life to save mine more than once.

他是一名战士 取得的成就是你们一辈子都得不到的
He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.

你南下黑城堡的路上? 
Your way down to Castle Black?

他在哪儿杀死异鬼的? 
Where did he kill a white walker?

你是怎么遇到我儿子的? 
How'd you come to meet my son?

守夜人去了我们的堡垒
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

长城以北  长城以北? 
North of the Wall.  North of the Wall?

近几个世纪以来 七大王国都在抵抗这些野蛮人的入侵 而我却在家里盛情款待他们中的一个 真是多亏了我的好儿子
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son.

它叫'碎心'
It's called Heartsbane.

已经在我们家族流传了五百多年
It's been in our family for 500 years.

全世界也没有几把留存了
Only a handful of them left in the world.

在我死后 它理应由我的长子继承
It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.

但他永远也别想得到这把剑
He will never wield that sword.

如果他成为了角陵的塔利伯爵 那将会是这个家族的末日
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house.

我见到你的时候以为你是个鼹鼠村的妓女 然后我接受了这个事实
I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that.

有什么人会爱上他? 
Who else would have him?

但我真是高估了他
But I overestimated him.

一个野人婊子诱惑了我儿子
It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

你这是在报复我吗 小子? 
This you getting back at me, boy?

把那东西带到我的餐桌上 让它和我共进晚餐? 
Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?

你得到了自己一直想要的 对吗? 
And you got what you were after, didn't you?

一个私生子 一个血统不正的私生子
A bastard. A half breed bastard.

作为你回家的邀请函
Your invitation into our home.

来吧 亲爱的 塔拉
Come, my dear. Talla.

我吃不下去了
I've lost my appetite.

你丢了你自己的脸
You dishonor yourself.

你母亲心地善良 你不配做她的儿子
Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.

为了让她开心 我会留下那野人 她可以在厨房打杂
To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens.

你的私生子也可以由我们抚养
The bastard will be raised here.

但今晚会是你这辈子在角陵的最后一个晚上
But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.

我很抱歉让他这样对待你
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.

我害怕他会赶走你和小山姆
I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.

我并不生你的气
I'm not angry at you.

让我生气的是那些可怕的人 他们那样对待好人却不受到任何惩罚
I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it.

你什么时候离开? 
When do you have to go?

替我向他道别
Say good bye to him for me.

你不是他所说的那样 山姆
You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.

他并不了解你是什么样的人
He doesn't know what you are.

什么?   收拾好东西
What?  Get your things.

我什么东西也没有
I don't have any things.

你在干什么啊?   我们应该在一起
What are you doing?  We belong together.

你母亲和妹妹怎么办? 
What about your mother and sister?

哦 她们会理解的
Oh, they'll understand.

反正你穿着更好看
Looks better on you anyway.

那是你父亲的剑
That's your father's sword.

It's my family's sword.

他不会来找剑吗? 
Won't he come for it?

那就让他来啊
He can bloody well try.

Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?

大口喝吧 我尊贵的国王 尽情享受这杯香甜佳酿
Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.

这将是他人生的最后一口

我的小金狮 被无礼 粗暴地害死

Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

Take my life instead.

若我心爱的孩子已经死去 哪怕一天我也难以支撑
For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.

仿佛明日将不会降临这个世上
And there is no tomorrow.

什么声音? 什么味道? 
What is that I hear and smell?

我就要送那人踏上地狱之道
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

他们说泰温・兰尼斯特拉出的都是黄金 是时候来看看他们是不是在骗人

你回来做什么? 
What are you doing back here?

那天观众里也有你
I saw you the other day in the audience.

这愚蠢的戏你都看过几遍了? 
How many times have you seen this stupid play?

我记得演员去我们村庄时
I remember when the players came to my village.

我没有钱 于是我偷偷溜了进去
I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.

我看到上了妆的脸 戏服 听了歌 在年轻的恋人相拥而死时痛哭
Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.

第二天 我离家加入了他们 从此再未回头
I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.

我最后那段独白像屎一样
My final speech is shit.

但就像我经常说的 也是摸着良心说的 剧本写得不好
But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.

没有你的话 他们不过就是在放屁打嗝 打打闹闹
It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.

你想怎么改? 
How would you change it?

王太后爱她的孩子 胜过一切
The queen loves her son more than anything.

你有双会说话的眼睛 茉慈
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

你喜欢扮成其他人吗?

我得走了 我父亲在等我

克连恩夫人 他们爱您
Lady Crane, they loved you.

他们真可爱 要不就是喝醉了
They were sweet. Or drunk.

奈德死的时候没人笑

是啊 你人兽通吃啊
Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.

我只是善用天赋 尽己所能
I do what I can with what I'm given.

用你的天赋? 
With what you're given?

额 我在想…
Well, I was thinking...

哦 现在我们都是思想家了 是么? 
Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

奶头里都是想法
Full to the tits with ideas.

我不是说… 你有个想法 我有个想法 他也有个想法
I didn't mean...  You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas.

为什么我的想法比你们的更有价值?  就因为我一辈子都在干这个
Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life?

谁想来评判我的工作?

疯狂已到尽头!

富贵抑或贫穷 高尚抑或平庸 一旦有罪 皆需赎罪
Rich or poor, noble or common, if we sin, we must atone.

提利尔家族的玛格丽 以罪人之身至此
Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner.

她在圣堂中面对诸神 撒了谎
She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied.

她对其弟犯下的罪行视若无睹
She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.

她令她的家族蒙羞 令国王蒙羞 令自己蒙羞
She disgraced her house, her king, and herself.

我们为玛格丽王后和洛拉斯・提利尔爵士而来
We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.

把他们交出来 否则我们不客气
Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

我无权把他们交给你们
I don't have the authority to give them to you.

而你们也无权把他们带走
And you don't have the authority to take them.

我代表拜拉席恩家族的托曼一世国王
I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.

诸神并不认为他有权处理此事
The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.

你已经侮辱了一个大家族
You've already insulted one great house.

不会再有第二个
It won't happen twice.

玛格丽・提利尔若走下这条街道 我就把所有麻雀都杀光
Every last sparrow will die before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.

因侍奉诸神而死 我们每个人都会倍感欣慰
To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us.

但我们今天不必如此
But there is no call for it today.

今天不会有赎罪游街
There will be no walk of atonement.

玛格丽王后已经赎罪 她已将另一人 带入七神的光芒之下
Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.

我们一同宣布 迎来一个崭新的和谐时代
Together we announce a new age of harmony.

迎来王权和神权的 神圣同盟
A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.

托曼国王万岁 愿诸神保佑你 玛格丽王后
Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!

王权和神权 是这个世界的两大支柱
The Crown and the Faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.

我们将一同恢复七国的荣耀
Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

就是这么回事
That's what's happening.

你跟教会作对 就是跟国王作对
When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.

任何跟国王作对的人 都不适合担任御林铁卫
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

从你出生之前我一直是御林铁卫
I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.

你不必如此 你不必做任何事
You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.

我必须给诸神交代
I have to answer to the gods.

坐在上王位的人不用给教会任何交代
Not when you're sitting in that chair.

此事的决定没有回旋余地
The Crown's decision on this matter is final.

那你要我脱光了游街吗? 
Will I be walking naked in the streets?

还是说我会在圣堂地牢里待上几个月 教教我什么叫诸神的仁慈? 
Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?

你已经忠诚地侍奉你的家族和国王很多年了
You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.

你将继续如此
And you will continue to do so.

但不是在君临
But not in this city.

那是座城堡 不是他妈的绵羊
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

你还知道它在哪儿吧
Presumably you still know where it is.

你不是弄丢了奔流城
You didn't lose Riverrun.

而是让黑鱼抢去了
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

他突袭我们 他比任何人都熟悉那座城堡
He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.

红色婚礼之后 你的确把黑鱼弄丢了
You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.

他就在这个大厅里 你却让他给跑了
You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.

我让你去抓住他 杀掉他 你却连人影都没找到
Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him.

这才叫弄丢了
That's what it means to lose something.

如今他回来了 还抢去了奔流城
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

我不觉得应该怪我们
I don't think it's fair to blame us...

三百年来 我们一直在亲徒利家的靴子 向他们和他们那臭烘烘的鳟鱼旗子誓忠
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.

再也不能这样了 奔流城是我们的
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

我们人手不够
We don't have the men.

我们的人手是那条死鱼的十倍
We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.

梅利斯特家族叛变了 布莱伍德家族也是
The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.

无旗兄弟会在召集平民造反 袭击我们的补给车队和营地
The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.

奔流城经得住一年的围攻
Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.

如果你们只提得出借口 不如让她来管事
If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.

他们在嘲笑我们
They're laughing at us.

整个河间地 直到君临 都在嘲笑我们
All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.

我睡觉的时候都听得见!
I hear it in my sleep!

你们真是不走运 我还没死呢
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

在他们把自己的嘲笑吞回去噎死之前  我绝不咽气
And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.

把城堡夺回来
Take that castle back.

他不会投降的 父亲
He'll never yield, Father.

你把你那把刀拿给他看 那把刀杀了罗柏・史塔克的婊子肚子里的孩子 你也把你的刀拿出来 那把割了他侄女喉咙的刀
You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat.

然后你们给他提提醒 红色婚礼是为谁办的婚礼
And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.

开心点 艾德慕大人
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

我被派去对付黑鱼
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.

瓦德・佛雷显然没法自己应付 因为他都四百岁了
Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old.

给我一支军队去河间地 围城估计得持续几个月
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.

去外地带兵 总比被抓进圣堂的地牢好
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.

我不会去河间地的
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

我要给波隆备下世人不敢想象的巨额酬金 让他召集最好的杀手
I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows.

然后我带他们去大圣堂 砍掉大麻雀的头 砍掉所有麻雀的头
I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.

你不能这么做  他抢走了我们的儿子! 他偷走了我们的儿子!
You can't.  He has our son! He stole our son!

他在分裂我们的家族
He's torn our family apart.

我们该如何处置那些分裂我们的人? 
How should we treat people who tear us apart?

绝不放过他们 不给他们任何慈悲
We should treat them without mercy and we will.

但如果你杀了大麻雀 你不会活着离开圣堂的
But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.

而没有你 一切都毫无意义
And without you, this is all for nothing.

立于军队之首 那是属于你的位置 也是父亲想要你在的位置
Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you.

让我们的人看清楚 他们应该向谁效忠
Show our men where their loyalties belong.

让他们看看兰尼斯特家族的样子 和我们处置敌人的手段
Show them what Lannisters are, what we do to our enemies.

把那个愚蠢的小城堡夺回来 因为它是我们的 因为你做得到
And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.

你马上要接受审判了 我得守着你
You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.

那会是一场比武审判
It will be a trial by combat.

他们这些人 只能让我们更强大
They've made us both stronger, all of them.

他们不知道我们有多强大
They have no idea how strong we are.

不知道等待他们的是什么下场
No idea what we're going to do to them.

我们一直在一起
We've always been together.

也会永远在一起
We'll always be together.

全世界只有我俩
We're the only two people in the world.

三眼乌鸦派我来的
The Three Eyed Raven sent for me.

三眼乌鸦死了
The Three Eyed Raven's dead.

我上次见到你的时候 你还是个孩子
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

最喜欢爬城墙 把他的母亲吓得不轻
Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.

琼恩最后一次来信说 你在长城之外失踪了
The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

我带领一队游骑兵深入北方 寻找白鬼的踪迹
I led a ranging party deep into the North to find white walkers.

一个白鬼用冰剑捅了我的肚子
A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.

留下我等死
Left me there to die.

森林之子发现了我
The Children found me.

阻止了异鬼的魔法
Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.

和他们当初造出异鬼的方法一样
The same way they made the walkers in the first place.

一片龙晶刺入心脏
A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.

现在你成为了三眼乌鸦
You are the Three Eyed Raven now.

我没时间去学 我什么都控制不了
I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.

在夜王到来之前 你必须学会控制
You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.

他总会找到办法 攻入人类世界
One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men.

当他到来时 你会在等候着他
When he does, you will be there waiting for him.

你要做好准备
And you will be ready.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
'风暴降生' 弥林的女王

一切还好吗? 
Everything all right?

到弥林还要骑多少天? 
How many days' ride to Meereen?

把我的卡拉萨带回维斯特洛需要多少艘船? 
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?

多斯拉克人以及他们的马 无垢者 次子团… 至少需要一千艘船
Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons...  a 1,000 ships easily.

或许更多  谁有那么多艘船? 
Probably more.  And who has that many?

所以我们骑马回弥林 然后启航去维斯特洛
So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.

你不适合坐在宫殿里的王位上
You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.

你是个征服者 风暴降生的丹妮莉丝
You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

来吧 再加把劲儿
Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?

哦 先生们 这边请 往右走
Oh, gentlemen, please. To my right.

还有你们 加油 不要停下来
And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving.

我活了这么多年 还从没见过一个人能像你这样挥动斧头
In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.

得多少人才能把你撂倒? 
How many men did it take to cut you down?

他一定是个怪物
He must have been some kind of monster.

我想有些人有点怕你
I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.

当我发现你时 以为你已经死了好几天
When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days.

身体发臭 上面都是虫子 骨头也露出来了
The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.

我还想着要给你个体面的葬礼呢 你却突然开始咳嗽
I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.

差点给我吓出屎来
Oh, nearly shit myself.

把你放到马车上时 我以为你会死 可你没有
I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't.

在接下来的几天里 我觉得你一定会死个十几回 可你没有 是什么让你活了下来? 
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?

不 你还待在这儿是有原因的
No, there's a reason you're still here.

是啊 是有原因的 我是个大浑蛋 很难被杀死
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.

诸神还不准备收了你
Gods aren't done with you yet.

我以前听说过这话
I've heard that before.

不过那人谈的是别的神
Man was talking about a different god, though.

也许他是对的
Well, maybe he was right.

我不太了解神
I don't know much about the gods.

你入错行了
You're in the wrong line of work.

哦 有很多虔诚的王八蛋 他们以为自己了解上帝或神的话
Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods.

我不了解 我甚至不知道惦们真正的名字
I don't. I don't even know their real names.

也许是七神 也许是旧神
Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods.

也许是光之王
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

也许他们都他妈是一种东西
Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.

我认为 最重要的 是有些事物比我们自身伟大得多
What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us.

不管是什么 惦对桑铎・克里冈有自己的打算
And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.

你不了解过去的我
You didn't know me back in my time.

你不了解我做过的事
You don't know the things I've done.

如果诸神真的存在 惦们为什么没有惩罚我? 
If the gods are real...  why haven't they punished me?

今天我们读什么? 
What are we reading today?

圣母之书 总主教大人
The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.

第三章 第 12 节
Chapter three, verse 12.

'可以磨平石头 一个女人的爱同样可以 抚平一个男人的残暴天性
'Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature.

妻子抚平丈夫的伤痛 慈母的歌声让儿子睡着'
A wife salves her husband's wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.'

有些人知道神圣文本里的每一节内容 但他们的血液里没有圣母的一丝怜悯 而根本不会阅读的野蛮人 却理解圣父的智慧
There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom.

多年来 我假装 爱穷人 爱那些受折磨的人
For years I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted.

我同情他们 但我从未爱过他们
I had pity for them, but I never loved them.

很难去爱他们
They are hard to love.

穷人使我们厌恶 因为他们就是我们 只是被剥夺了我们拥有的幻想
The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions.

他们展示了我们褪去漂亮衣服的样子
They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.

我们没用香水时的味道
How'd we smell without perfume.

我可以问您一个私人问题吗? 
Can I ask you about a personal matter?

国王提到自从你们重聚 您还没有睡上他的婚床
The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.

殿下 您有职责
You have a duty, Your Grace.

无论是对您的丈夫 您的国王 您的国家 还是对您信仰的神
To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.

只是… 曾经的欲望一去不返
It's just...  the desires that once drove me no longer do.

国会不需要女人有欲望 只要求女人有耐心
Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience.

国王必须有继承人 如果我们还想继续我们的事业
The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.

有时很难找到真正的道路
Sometimes the true path is hard to find.

很难找到 更难走
Hard to find and harder still to walk upon.

但你已经取得了很大的进步
But you've made great progress.

我只祈祷你祖母能紧随你的脚步
I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.

荆棘女王是个了不起的女人 一个坚强的女人 也是一个不思悔改的罪人
The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner.

你必须教她新的方式 就像她曾教你老的方式
You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old.

否则我会担心她的安全 身心安全
Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.

它会动 会说话吗? 
Does it move or talk?

我想和你单独谈话
I want to speak with you alone.

乌尼亚修女一直是我真正的朋友和顾问
Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.

你现在不是在你的圣所 亲爱的
You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.

我只需要吹个口哨 我的人就会到这儿来 给你一顿海扁…
All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...

祖母 直到我叫停为止
Grandmother. Until I tell them to stop.

如果我让他们停下的话
If I tell them to stop.

真该打你一顿 奶奶 求您了
You could use a good bashing. Grandmother, please.

他们对你做了什么? 
What have they done to you?

你们向大麻雀进军 反对教团 我们是为了你才出兵的
You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith. We marched for you.

诸神原本会惩罚您和父亲 但他们没有
The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't.

他们很仁慈 你弟弟怎么办? 
They showed mercy. And what about your brother?

他们给了他什么样的仁慈? 
What mercy did they show him?

洛拉斯唯一的希望就是认罪 忏悔
Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.

如果他这样做了 教团便会允许他回到高庭
If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden.

他将放弃名字和爵位…
He'll have to renounce his name and title...

你疯了吗?  作为一个忏悔者生活
Have you lost your mind? And live his life as a penitent.

他是高庭的继承人  提利尔家族的未来
He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.

作为一个盲目的狂热分子
As a mindless fanatic.

你今天就回高庭
You will leave for Highgarden today.

没有法律规定你必须待在这儿
There is no law that says you must stay here.

我有责任侍奉我的丈夫 他是国王
It is my duty to serve my husband the king.

但您应该离开 奶奶
But you should leave, Grandmother.

您应该待在家里
Your place is at home.

我决不会离开你 决不
I will never leave you. Never.

在祈祷和善行中找到安慰
Find comfort in prayer and good works.

圣母照看着所有人
The Mother watches over us all.

希望能尽早再见 亲爱的
I'll see you soon, my dear.

七神保佑您 奶奶
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

我们说过会和你并肩战斗 乌鸦王 只等时机成熟 我们是认真的 但这和我们说好的不一样
We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to.

这些不是白鬼
These aren't white walkers.

这不是死亡军团
This isn't an army of the dead.

这不是我们要打的仗
This isn't our fight.

如果没有他 我们不会站在这里
If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.

你们都会成为夜王军队里的臭肉
All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.

我将是一堆烧焦的骨头 就像曼斯
And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.

还记得曼斯的营地吗? 
Remember Mance's camp?

它一直延伸到地平线
It stretched all the way to the horizon.

看看我们剩下的人
Look what's left of us.

如果输了这一仗 我们就完了
And if we lose this, we're gone.

数十部族 数百代人
Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.

就像从未出现过一样
Be like we were never there at all.

我们将是最后的自由民
We'll be the last of the free folk.

如果我们输了 这将是你们的下场
That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

波顿家族 卡史塔克家族 安柏家族 他们知道你们在这
The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here.

知道其中有一多半是妇孺
They know that more than half of you are women and children.

干掉我之后 他们会来对付你们
After they finish with me, they'll come for you.

这不是你们的战斗
This isn't your fight.

你们不必随我去临冬城
You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.

我不该要求你们
I shouldn't be asking you.

我们之前不是这么说的
It's not the deal we made.

但要想打败他们 我需要你们的帮助 如果你们想活下来 我们则必须打败他们
I need you with me if we're going to beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.

乌鸦们杀了他 就因为他替自由民说话 其他南方人不会这样
The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would.

如果我们不为他做同样的事 那和懦夫有什么区别
If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.

如果我们就是懦夫 那自由民活该终于我们之手
And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.

你能确定他们会来么? 
Are you sure they'll come?

我们不像你们南方人那么油滑
We're not clever like you southerners.

我们说什么 就是什么
When we say we'll do something, we do it.

我听说您要离开君临了
I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

这可跟你没什么关系
That is hardly your concern.

您的孙子还是个阶下囚
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

您准备离开他 让他烂在监牢里么? 
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

洛拉斯烂在监牢里都是因为你
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

大麻雀统治着这个城市 是因为你
The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.

我们两个古老的家族正面临崩溃 也是因为你 以及你的愚蠢
Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.

我犯了一个严重的错误
I made a terrible mistake.

每天我都在提醒自己
I carry it with me every single day.

我给自己家门口送来一批狂热分子
I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.

现在我们必须同仇敌忾
And now we must fight them together.

我在想你是不是我见过的最差劲的人
I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.

已经这把年纪 我也想不起来了
At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

不过这么多年来你确实作恶多端
But the truly vile do stand out through the years.

你还记得我的孙子和孙女被拽到监牢里的时候 你是怎么冲着我幸灾乐祸的么? 
Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?

我记得 我永远不会忘
I do. I'll never forget it.

您爱您的孙女
You love your granddaughter.

这是我唯一确定的事
It's the only truth I know.

我可得赶紧离开这个可悲的城市 省得被那些光脚的狂热分子扔进他们的监狱
I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.

如果你有你自己想的一半那么聪明的话 你也会离开这里的
If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find a way out of here, too.

我绝不会离开我的儿子
I'll never leave my son.

那你能怎么办? 
What'll you do, then?

不像以前了 你没有支援了
You have no support. Not anymore.

你弟弟已经走了 这一点大麻雀已经料理好了
Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.

你家族的其他人都已经抛弃了你
The rest of your family have abandoned you.

人民鄙视你
The people despise you.

你被成千上万的敌人包围
You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them.

你想凭自己杀光他们么? 
You're going to kill them all by yourself?

这是我在这一切的苦难中能找到的唯一乐趣了
It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.

看吧 这样的围城毫无意义
Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.

得有人教教这帮可悲的娘们怎么挖战壕
Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.

是得有人教啊
Someone certainly does.

我只是个瞎蹦垩的雇佣剑士
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

你是涂过圣油的骑士 完全两回事
You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.

是啊 当骑士可没有报酬
Aye, knights don't get paid.

你的军事才能胜过兰尼斯特军队的任何军官
You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.

这就跟说我的那话儿比无垢者军队里任何人都大差不多
That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.

我希望不久之后可以统领所有的兰尼斯特军队
I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.

你可以成为我失去的右手
You can be the right hand I lost.

你答应给我一个爵位 一座城堡 还能娶一位出身高贵的美女
You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.

这三样你都得到了 兰尼斯特有债…
And you'll get all three. A Lannister always...

别说了 别他娘的说了
Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

出来跟我们打啊 黑鱼
Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

把城交出来 不然我们绞死他
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

这是最后通牒
This is your last warning.

你以为我不敢吗 老头? 
You think I won't do it, old man?

是我一刀抹了你侄女的喉咙 划个半张脸大的口子
I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.

可你却跑哪去了? 跟他妈胆小鬼似的躲来躲去
And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.

交出城来 不然我连他的喉咙也切了
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

请便 想切就切吧
Go on, then. Cut his throat.

我们不知道你要来
We didn't know you were coming.

那是因为你没有做好封锁
'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.

八千个人未经任何阻挠就来到了你这
You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.

幸好我们是朋友 否则你们的屁眼现在已经被爆了
Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.

带艾德慕大人沐浴进餐
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

艾德慕是佛雷家的囚犯
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

只有傻瓜才拿自己做不到的事威胁别人
Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.

现在 我威胁要打你 除非你闭上嘴 但你还是说个不停
Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.

你觉得我会怎么办?   我才不管你…
What do you think I'd do? I don't give a rat's...

我依国王之命来此收回这座城堡
I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.

带他沐浴进餐
Have him bathed and fed.

除非你想取代他的位置
Unless you'd like to take his place.

我很抱歉 詹姆爵士
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

现在由我指挥围攻
The siege is now under my command.

下一次黑鱼再从城墙往外看的时候 他将看到的是兵临城下的军队 而不是你们这堆破玩意
The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.

让你的人开始挖外围的战壕
Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches.

每一百码设哨兵
Set pickets every hundred yards.

把这些攻城塔和投石机捣毁重做
And work doubletime on those siege towers and trebuchets.

这些是我们的攻城塔…
Those are our siege towers...

我说了 现在听我指挥
As I said, the siege is under my command.

如果你不乐意 给我走人
If that's not to your liking, go home.

给黑鱼带个话
Get word to the Blackfish.

我赌老家伙赢
My money's on the old boy.

欢迎来到熊岛
Welcome to Bear Island.

你出生的时候我还记得 小姐
I remember when you were born, my lady.

你以我的姑妈莱安娜的名字命名
You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

据说她是个大美人 想来你也会是
It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.

那不一定 我妈妈不是大美人 什么美人也不是
I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty.

但她是一位伟大的战士
She was a great warrior, though.

她为你哥哥罗柏战死
She died fighting for your brother Robb.

莱安娜小姐 我在黑城堡是你伯父的手下
I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

他也是一位伟大的战士 德高望重
He was also a great warrior and an honorable man.

我是他的事务官 事实上…
I was his steward. In fact...

家长里短我们聊得够多了 说正事吧
I think we've had enough small talk. Why are you here?

史坦尼斯 ・ 拜拉席恩驻守黑城堡 他进军临冬城 然后被杀
Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.

他给我看过那封你回应他求援的信
He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.

上面写道…   我记得上边写了什么
It said... I remember what it said.

熊岛不认国王 只认北境之王 名为史塔克
Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.

罗柏死了 但史塔克家族没有
Robb is gone, but House Stark is not.

它比任何时候都需要你们的支持
And it needs your support now more than ever.

我和我妹妹来此 希望得到莫尔蒙家族的效忠
I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.

据我所知 你是私生子 而珊莎夫人嫁到了波顿家
As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

还是兰尼斯特家? 
Or is she a Lannister?

消息太多 说什么的都有
I've heard conflicting reports.

小姐 我竭尽所能 只为生存
I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.

但我姓史塔克 永远都姓史塔克
But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.

随你 不过话说回来 你想要的不止我的忠诚 还有我的战士们
If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.

决不能让拉姆斯・波顿霸占临冬城 小姐
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady.

我们有责任阻止他
It is our duty to stop him.

此外 他还囚禁了我们的幼弟瑞肯・史塔克
Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

小姐 你必须明白…
What you have to understand, my lady, is that...

我明白我的责任在于熊岛 在于岛上的每一个人
I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.

为什么我要为了一场别人的战争再去牺牲哪怕一个族人的性命呢? 
So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?

小姐 请让我说两句
If it please, my lady,

我理解您的感受
I understand how you feel.

我不认识这位爵士 你是? 
I don't know you, Ser...?

我是席渥斯家族的戴佛斯 小姐
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

您不必向学士询问我的家族
You needn't ask your maester about my house.

好吧 席渥斯家族的戴佛斯爵士
All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

你是如何理解我的感受的呢? 
How is it you understand how I feel?

您从未想过有一天自己会身居如此高位
You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.

年纪轻轻 就要对这么多的人民负责
Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.

我也没想过会到达今天的位置
I never thought I'd be in my position.

我是一个捕蟹人的儿子 做过走私犯
I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.

在当今的战争年代 我的演说对象 却是一个伟大家族的小姐
And now I find myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war.

我在这里 是因为这不是别人的战争
But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.

您的伯父 莫尔蒙总司令 让这个人做了他的事务官
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward.

他选择琼恩做他的继任者 因为他深知 他有坚持正义的勇气 甚至不惜抛头颅洒热血
He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life.

因为杰奥・莫尔蒙和琼恩・雪诺都清楚 真正的战争不是几个家族间的吵吵闹闹
Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.

而是生者与亡者的对决
It's between the living and the dead.

不要铸成大错 小姐 亡者就要来了
And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.

你的伯父在先民拳峰与它们对战
Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.

我在艰难屯与它们交锋
I fought them at Hardhome.

波顿占据临冬城一日 北境就一日不得统一
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided.

四分五裂的北境在夜王面前没有半点胜算
And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.

你想要保护你的人民 小姐 我理解这一点
You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand.

但面对亡者大军他们无处可逃
But there's no hiding from this.

人类必须团结一心 共同抗敌
We have to fight and we need to do it together.

千年以来 莫尔蒙家族对史塔克忠心耿耿
House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years.

今日我们仍将坚守忠诚信念
We will not break faith today.

我们能获得多少人手? 
How many fighting men can we expect?

六十二个?  我们不是大家族 但我们是骄傲的家族
62? We are not a large house, but we're a proud one.

每一个熊岛人 都能打十个内陆佬
And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

只要他们有小姐的一半勇猛 波顿的末日就指日可待了
If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.

我猜你此次前来 是要履行对我侄女的诺言
I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

可我没看到珊莎和艾莉亚
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

我没找到她们 真遗憾
I don't have them. Pity.

那你是回来继续做俘虏的喽? 
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

那你为什么来? 
Then why are you here?

你知道我为什么来
You know why I'm here.

这座城堡属于佛雷家族
This castle belongs to House Frey.

以托曼国王之名 我命你即刻投降 否则…
In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or...

否则你就杀了艾德慕? 
Or you'll kill Edmure?

无论我怎么做 我侄子都难逃一死
My nephew's marked for death no matter what.

就请你快快吊死他吧
Hang him and be done with it.

不止艾德慕
It won't stop with Edmure.

你这是逼着我强攻城堡
You'll force me to storm the castle.

我死几百人 你死几千人
Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.

前提还是你能突破城墙
If you can breach the walls.

我们定能攻破城墙 还将杀光城中老小
We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.

但只要你投降
But if you surrender,

我会饶了所有人的性命
I'll spare the lives of your men.

与破誓者讨价还价就如同在流沙上面盖房子
Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.

战争已经结束了 爵士
The war is over, ser.

为什么还要为了已经失败的事业白白牺牲人命呢? 
Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?

只要我还没倒下 战争就不算结束
As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.

我出生在这里 也准备好了死在这里
I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.

你要么打过来 要么试着把我们饿垮
So you can either attack or try to starve us out.

我们的给养能撑两年
We have enough provisions for two years.

你们撑得过两年吗 弑君者? 
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

你显然无意拯救你的人民的生命
You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.

那你还来谈判作甚? 
Why did you come treat with me?

我是来见一见你本人 再好好掂量一下你
And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.

葛洛佛伯爵 请你听我们说完 我听够了
Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. I've heard enough.

我们刚从铁民手里夺回这座城堡
We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.

波顿帮了我们一把
The Boltons helped us do it.

现在你想让我反水去打他们? 
Now you want me to fight against them?

光是和你们谈话我就有可能被剥皮
I could be skinned for even talking to you.

波顿是叛徒 卢斯・波顿…
The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton...

有其他北境家族愿意为你们而战吗? 
Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?

我们向曼德勒家族放出了渡鸦…
We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...

我不关心什么渡鸦
I don't care about ravens.

你要我加入你的军队
You're asking me to join your army.

这支军队里都有谁? 
Who is fighting in this army?

主要是野人
The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.

那么流言是真的了
Then the rumors are true.

我之前都不敢相信
I didn't dare believe them.

出于对你们父亲的敬意 我接见了你们
I received you out of respect for your father.

现在我要求你们离开
Now I would like you to leave.

葛洛佛家族不会辱没先祖 去和野人并肩而战
House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.

葛洛佛伯爵 没什么好说的了
Lord Glover. There's nothing else to say.

我要提醒你 葛洛佛家族向史塔克家族效忠
I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark.

宣誓响应史塔克家族的号召
Sworn to answer when called upon.

是的 几百年以来我的家族一直侍奉史塔克家族
Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries.

收到令尊死讯的时候我们纷纷流下眼泪
We wept when we heard of your father's death.

我的兄长做这座城堡的领主时 响应了罗柏的号召 推举他为北境之王
When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North.

但是当铁民攻入这座城堡 把我的妻儿投入狱中
And where was King Robb when the ironborn attacked this castle?

残杀我们的家臣的时候 罗柏国王又在哪里呢? 
When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects?

和一个外国婊子鬼混
Taking up with a foreign whore.

害得自己和追随者们中计身死
Getting himself and those who followed him killed.

我曾经侍奉过史塔克家族 但史塔克家族已经灭亡了
I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.

我们为什么要来这里? 
Why did we have to come here?

我们中还是有人喜欢这里的
Some of us still like it.

多少喝一杯吧
Have a drink at least.

我很快就去找你
I'll find you in a bit.

在铁群岛上可没有这等翘臀
Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.

你当真一点性趣也没有了吗? 
Doesn't interest you anymore?

抱歉 我不开那方面的玩笑了
I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.

我永远不会伤害你的 小弟弟
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

你觉得攸伦叔叔正在搜捕我们? 
You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

那是当然 只要我们活着 对他就是个威胁
Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.

世界很大 我们有快船
It's a great big world and we have fast ships.

我不管你想不想 喝
I don't care what you want. Drink.

你是个铁种 席恩 我知道你这几年很难熬
You're ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.

但我已经受够了看着你像条落水狗一样畏畏缩缩
But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.

把他妈的麦酒喝了
Drink the goddamn ale.

我需要真正的席恩・葛雷乔伊 不是这个老鼠屎一样的冒牌货
The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender.

你能帮我找到他吗? 
Can you find him for me?

你逃出来了 听到了吗? 
You escaped. You hear me?

你逃出来了 永远不会再回去了
You got away and you're never going back.

我们会为你讨回公道
We'll get justice for you.

按照公道 我应该被烧死然后吊在临冬城门前
If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.

那就去他妈的公道 我们要复仇 喝
Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.

如果你这样萎靡 那就再也没有机会了 你还不如拿把刀割了手腕
If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists.

但如果你留下 席恩 我需要你
But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.

我们要驶去弥林
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

我们要去和那个龙女王达成协议
We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.

我们要把铁群岛给夺回来
And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.

你真的站在我这边吗? 
Are you really with me?

那么 既然过了今晚咱们就一时半会上不了岸
Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,

我要好好跟她来上一发
I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.

史坦尼斯在去临冬城的路上在这里扎过营
Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.

好事? 
And that's a good thing?

他曾是维斯特洛最有经验的指挥官
He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.

他选择这里一定是有原因的
He chose this place for a reason.

有山作天然屏障
Those mountains are a natural fortification.

有河可以饮马
There's a stream down there for the horses.

我们不会在这儿呆太久
We're not staying here long.

随时可能有另一场风暴袭来
Another storm could hit any day.

是啊 暴风雪击败了史坦尼斯 战功跟波顿家族相当
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.

我们必须趁现在向临冬城进军
We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.

霍伍德家的两百人 梅辛家的一百四十三人…
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

比我们预计的要少得多
It's not what we'd hoped for.

但是如果我们足够谨慎和精明的话 还是有机会的
But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.

他现在成了你最信任的顾问了? 
So he's your most trusted advisor now?

就因为他从一个十岁小孩那里弄来了六十二个人? 
Because he secured 62 men from a 10yearold?

多亏了戴佛斯爵士 我现在才能站在这儿和你说话 而且他效忠史坦尼斯已经很多年了
Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.

输掉了黑水河之战的史坦尼斯 杀了自己弟弟的史坦尼斯 断头的史坦尼斯? 
Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?

这还远远不够 我们需要更多的人手
It's not enough. We need more men.

如果我们去赛文城的话 我认识那里的领主…
If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord...

我们只能靠现有的军队去战斗
We fight with the army we have.

朋友们 不值得为这点事打起来
Friends, this is not worth fighting over!

好吧 这事儿没必要打架…
Right, now we don't need to be fighting...

你他妈的是谁?  等等
Who the fuck are you? Hold on.

对啊 你他妈的是谁啊? 
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

我曾经是个士兵
I was a soldier once.

我的上级全都以为我非常勇敢
All my superiors thought I was brave.

实际上我并不勇敢 没错 我从来没临阵脱逃过
I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight.

那只是因为我害怕战友们会看出来我在害怕
Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.

我只不过是个懦夫
That's all I was, a coward.

我们服从命令 无论那命令是什么
We followed orders no matter the orders.

好吧 我就来当这个纵火犯
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

去偷那个农民的庄稼 行 我现在成了个贼
Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief.

杀了那些小伙子 这样他们就不会反抗我们
Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.

我记得有一次 一个女人向我们尖叫 我们把她儿子从小屋里拖出来的时候 她叫我们禽兽
I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.

但我们不是禽兽
But we weren't animals.

禽兽从来都是顺应自己的天性 而我们却违反了天性
Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours.

我亲自割了那个男孩的喉咙 他的母亲一直在尖叫 我的战友们拉着她
I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.

这种羞耻感是如此的沉重
Shame was so heavy on me,

我甚至吃不下饭 睡不着觉
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

我能做的就只有盯着那片昏暗的天空 脑海中回响着那位母亲喊她儿子的声音
All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.

我这辈子都没法忘记那声音
I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.

现在 我明白我永远不能让那个孩子死而复生
Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.

在我的余生里我能做到的 就只有给这个世界带来一点善意了
All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world.

我们每个人都能做到这点 不是吗? 
That's all any of us can do, isn't it?

不再打劫 不再杀人 这永远都不会太迟
Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.

开始帮助别人
Start helping people.

转恶向善永远都不会太迟
It's never too late to come back.

我们并不期望着诸神回应我们的祈祷
And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.

这甚至和诸神无关 只和我们自己有关
It's not even about the gods. It's about you.

得明白 我们的祈祷要靠自己去回应
Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.

七神祝福你们 朋友们
Seven save you, friends.

你们在这儿干什么? 
What are you doing here?

嗯 我们在谈论人生
Well, we're talking about life.

我们在保护人民
Protecting the people.

好吧 我们感谢你们的保护
Well, we thank you for your protection.

可你们是在保护我们免受什么人的伤害呢? 
Who are you protecting us from?

你们有马么? 
Do you have any horses?

吃的总该有吧 保护人民可是很容易饿的
Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.

欢迎留下来一起吃晚餐 但是我们也有很多吃不饱的人
You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.

长夜漫漫 处处险恶
The night is dark and full of terrors.

我他妈的是个修士 我还能说什么? 
I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?

他们不信你的七神
They don't believe in your Seven.

他们是兄弟会的人 信的是红神
They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.

哎呀 好吧 这里欢迎所有人
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

无论如何 我们没什么可给他们的
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

你当然有 你有吃的 你还有武器 就算你告诉他们没有
Sure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't.

你这里还有女人
And you've got women.

你打算怎么办? 跟他们打? 
What do you want to do? Fight them?

只能靠你一个对付他们所有人
It'd be you against all of them.

我是说 其他人可不会战斗
I mean, these people don't know how to fight.

我再也不打仗了
I'm done with fighting.

自卫呢? 
Even if it's to protect yourself?

暴力是一种疾病
Violence is a disease.

你不可能通过传染更多的人来治愈疾病
You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.

你死了的话也没法治病了
You don't cure it by dying, either.

你今天干的活够多了
You've done enough work for one day.

来吃点晚饭吧
Come on up for some supper.

今天晚上会很冷
It's gonna be a cold night.

我会给你留一碗炖肉的
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

没准还能藏一点麦酒带给你
Might even have some ale hidden away.

他是个实在人
He's not a lying man.

他说铁舰队已经到了奴隶湾
He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.

我信了他
I'm inclined to believe him.

我可要离那些疯子远点
I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.

我想要坐船回家
I want to book passage home.

就你? 你付不起路费的
You? Can't afford it.

你从哪儿偷来的这些? 
Where'd you steal this from?

我们两天后离开
We leave in two days.

你可以住在三等舱的吊床上
You can have a hammock in steerage.

而且我们一早就走
And we'll leave at dawn.

倾听神的召唤 他们为你歌唱
Listen to the gods, for you they sing.

无需再战 乖孩子
Fight no more, sweet child.

恶狼深埋地底 伪鹿命数已尽
The wolves are buried and the false stag done.

阖上你的碧眼 吾爱
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

天父召唤你前往他的殿堂
The Father above beckons you to his hall.

我将与你重逢在七重天上
In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.

不过我先要让贱人珊莎血债血偿 还有我的弟弟小恶魔 他杀死了自己的国王
But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king.

他生在狮群 却带来诅咒
Born amongst lions, our curse from within.

我发誓 我要杀了他
I will slay him, I swear.

无论是用绞索还是利刃 不管是用两周 一个月还是耗尽今生
With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon or my life.

什么声音? 什么味道? 
What is that I hear and smell?

不久我便送那人踏上地狱之道
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

他们说泰温·兰尼斯特拉的全是黄金 是时候看看他们是不是在骗人
It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

你这个禽兽 你这个禽兽 杀死了我的妻子
You beast, you beast. You killed my wife.

如今还夺走了你父亲的性命
And now you've taken your father's life.

这片土地上没有比你更恶毒的孩子了
No worse child ever stained this land.

我诅咒我为你命名的日子
I curse the day I named you.

却一直喜欢坏男人 他们也总是喜欢我
I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me.

有些晚上他们回家的时候 如果那还算是家的话 满身都是婊子的香粉味
They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.

我们便大干一仗 我就在他们身上开个洞
So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.

过后我感觉糟透了 就再把他们缝起来
And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up.

熟能生巧嘛
I got good at patching them up.

拿刀开洞也熟能生巧了
And good at putting holes in them.

那个女演员怎么了? 
What happened to the actress?

想让你死的那个
The one who wanted you dead.

在我收拾了她的脸之后 她恐怕很难再找到一份演员的工作了
She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.

我一直没学会做饭
I never did learn to cook.

不过你还是得吃 你需要营养
But eat. Eat. You need it.

剧团要转场到潘托斯去了
The company is moving on to Pentos soon.

你应该与我们同去
You should come with us.

我预感你会很擅长这类工作的
Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.

除此之外 我们还需要个新女演员呢
And besides, we need a new actress.

我不大可能记住所有的台词
I don't think I could remember all of the lines.

你在这儿还有什么挂念的? 
What's left for you here?

你不会安全的
You wouldn't be safe.

只要她还在找我
Not while she's looking for me.

她没有名字
She doesn't have a name.

厄斯索斯在东 维斯特洛在西
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

可维斯特洛再往西是什么地方? 
But what's west of Westeros?

地图都在那里戛然而止
That's where all the maps stop.

也许那就是世界的边缘
The edge of the world, maybe.

我想去看看
I'd like to see that.

那是什么?   罂粟花奶
What's that?  Milk of the poppy.

不睡觉你就好不了
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

相信我 要是我的汤都杀不死你 那就没什么能杀死你了
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.

聊聊加廷斯的事吧 他原来帅气吗
Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.

我曾是著名的接吻高手
I was a famous kisser.

你们这些小伙知道怎么正确地接吻吗? 
You lads know how to kiss proper?

这种技术是为大师准备的
This is for masters, this technique.

你们还没准备好  我准备好了
You're not ready.  I'm ready.

好吧 现在注意了
All right. Now, pay attention.

把左手放在女士的脑后
You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.

你的右手像这样环住女士的腰
Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.

现在伸出你的中指 懂吗 然后直接捅进她的屁眼
Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.

啊 闻起来就跟蜜穴一样
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

看看他 你硬了吗 小子? 
Look at him. You get hard, boy?

去你娘的! 恶心的老混蛋
Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.

放过这茬儿吧 行吗 老混球们? 
Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?

还有一个在哪? 
Where's the other one?

那个披着黄斗篷的  去你娘的!
The one with the yellow cloak.  Fuck you!

这就是你的遗言 去你娘的? 
Those are your last words, fuck you?

拜托 说句像样点的
Come on, you can do better.

你死得屎都不如 你知道吧? 
You're shit at dying, you know that?

可以说我下了一盘好棋
I'd call that a successful gambit.

是吗?   四处看看
Would you?  Look around.

这个城市又重生了
The city has come back to life.

你与狂热之徒定了协议  我做了 也奏效了
You made a pact with fanatics.  I did and it worked.

若你用一把笔直的剃刀剃须 你说剃刀有用
If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.

这不代表它不会割断你的喉咙
That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.

你说这话就像是个从来不用剃须的男人
Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.

我会想念你的
I'm going to miss you.

我希望你的观点是正确的
I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.

如果我没回来 你就知道我错了
If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.

我们需要维斯特洛的盟友
We need friends in Westeros.

最重要的是 我们需要我们的女王
Most of all, we need our queen.

她会回来的 她必须回来
She'll come back. She has to.

我的心已经破碎过太多次了
My heart's been broken too many times already.

剩下的路我就自己走了
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

在这座城市最出名的侏儒身边 我是没办法执行秘密任务的
I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.

是世界上最出名的侏儒
The most famous dwarf in the world.

陛下 有几个教团武装的成员 被准许进入红堡了
Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.

这真是个折磨人的说法
That's rather a tortured way of putting it.

他们要求觐见您 陛下
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

谁准许他们进入红堡的? 
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?

国王知道他们来了吗? 
The king is aware of their presence?

他正在他的寝宫里做祈祷
He's currently in his chambers at prayer.

陛下 总主教大人 希望能够在贝勒大圣堂与您谈话
Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.

随时欢迎 总主教大人 到红堡来见我
His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.

陛下 这不是一个请求
Your Grace, this is not a request.

这是一个请求 蓝赛尔表弟
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

你在请求我 而我拒绝
You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.

总主教命令了你
The High Septon commands you.

你确定你想要拒绝他吗? 
Are you sure you want to refuse him?

他承诺过我可以在红堡里一直待到审判日
He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.

他没有做过这种承诺
He made no such promises.

如果你拒绝自愿前来…
If you refuse to come of your own free will

命令你的人退下 否则我们将用暴力解决
Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.

请你告诉总主教大人 随时欢迎他大驾光临
Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.

看起来像是围城 女士
Looks like a siege, my lady.

你有很敏锐的军事头脑 波德
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

请告诉詹姆·兰尼斯特爵士 我与他有要事相商
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.

告诉他我配有他的剑
Tell him I have his sword.

我们这个年纪做侍从是不是太老了? 
Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?

波德瑞克·天杀的·派恩
Podrick fucking Payne.

我还以为你都已经死了呢
I thought you'd be dead by now.

他们在里面吗?   是的
Are they in there?  Uh huh.

你觉得他们现在是干柴烈火吗? 
You think they're fucking?

为什么不? 换我的话我会操她
Why not? I'd fuck her.

你也会的 不是吗? 
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

反正 他会操她 这是肯定的
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

她也会干他的 你不觉得吗? 
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

你瞧她看他的样子
The way she looks at him.

其实所有女人看他的样子都他妈色眯眯的
The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.

就这一点而言 我倒更愿意跟在他弟弟身边
I preferred working with the little brother on that account.

拜托 你这个有着神屌的家伙
Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.

你肯定已经给她看过了吧
You must have shown it to her by now.

她一直在教我用剑  真的? 
She's training me to fight.  Is she?

哇  早晨一小时 晚上一小时
Oh.  An hour in the morning, an hour at night.

那为什么像我这样的老炮还是能偷偷靠近宰了你? 
Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?

呃 这不是一种打法
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

这下你说到点子上了 不是吗? 
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

你想学学这种打法吗? 
You want to learn that sort of fighting?

好吧 咱们从步法开始
All right, let's start with your footwork.

听我说 波德
Now listen to me, Pod.

看看你的双脚之间有一码宽? 
See how your feet are about a yard apart?

第一课 假设每个人都想打你
Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.

因为的确是这样的 波德 每个人都想打该死的侍从
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

再来 来嘛 别生气
Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.

我没想到你真找到了她
I never thought you'd find her.

我以为珊莎已经死了
I just assumed Sansa was dead.

你为什么会这么想? 
Why would you assume that?

以我的经验看 像她这样的女孩活不长
In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.

我不觉得你认识很多像她一样的女孩
I don't think you know many girls like her.

好吧 我为你感到骄傲
Well, I'm proud of you.

真的 你完成了自己对凯特琳·史塔克许下的誓言 尽管困难重重
I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.

当然 我姐姐想让珊莎死
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

毕竟她还是谋杀乔佛里的嫌犯之一 所以情况还有点复杂
The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication.

你来这到底想干嘛? 
What the hell are you doing here?

我来找黑鱼
I've come for the Blackfish.

欢迎你来带走他
You're welcome to have him.

珊莎夫人想从波顿家族手中夺回先祖的家堡 继承她应有的称号 临冬城夫人
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.

她准备用什么军队夺回临冬城? 
With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?

他们现在可有点忙
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

我奉命到此地收回 如今由徒利叛军占领的奔流城 所以你知道问题在哪了吧
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.

徒利为自己的家园而战 怎么就成了叛军? 
The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?

国王下令 将奔流城赐予佛雷家族
Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.

作为背叛罗柏·史塔克和屠杀他全家的奖励
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.

我们不该讨论政治
We shouldn't argue about politics.

你是骑士 詹姆爵士
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

我知道在你心底仍以此为荣
I know there is honor in you.

我亲眼所见  我是兰尼斯特家族的一员
I've seen it myself.  I'm a Lannister.

不要让我背叛我的家族
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

兵不血刃地拿下奔流城
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

完成你的任务 带你的军队毫发无伤回到南方
Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.

允许我举着休战旗进入奔流城
Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.

让我试着说服黑鱼交出城堡
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.

他为什么要放弃先祖的家堡? 
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

因为你不会阻拦他率军北上
Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.

你见过黑鱼吗? 
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

没有  他比你还固执
No.  He's even more stubborn than you are.

你就试着和这个老顽固讲讲道理
Try to talk some sense into the old goat.

他不会听 但他的部下或许能听进去
He won't listen, but his men might.

不是所有人都愿为别人的家送命
Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.

如果我说服他放弃奔流城 你会允许他们安全北上
If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant a safe passage north.

直到日落
You have until nightfall.

这把剑所承载的使命
You gave it to me for a purpose.

我已经完成了
I've achieved that purpose.

它将永远属于你
It will always be yours.

最后一件事 詹姆爵士
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

如果我没能说服黑鱼投降 那么当你攻打奔流城时 我必须恪守荣誉 同珊莎的亲属站在一边
Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.

希望你我不会走到这一步
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

我已经说过三遍了 不行
I've said no three times already.

我有一封信 你侄孙女珊莎·史塔克的亲笔信
I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.

我上次见到她时她还是个孩子
I haven't seen her since she was a child.

我没见过她的签名 我也不认识你
I don't know her signature. I don't know you.

我也不会投降 今晚守卫加倍
And I will not surrender. Double the guards tonight.

弑君者想试探我们
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

正如我所说 我叫…
As I have said, my name is

是的 塔斯的布蕾妮 我认识你父亲
Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.

一个好人  他非常推崇你
Good man.  He always spoke highly of you.

如果他在这里 我会和他说同样的话
And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

如果你认为靠着弑君者的荣誉作保 我就会放弃自己的家堡 那你就太蠢了
If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.

奔流城不可能抵挡得住兰尼斯特和佛雷的攻击
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.

我们会坚持够长的时间 长过你那独臂朋友的想象
We can stand longer than your one handed friend thinks we can.

他不是我朋友  不是吗? 
He's not my friend.  No?

谁让你穿过包围线 进入城堡? 
Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?

还给了你一把刻有金狮剑柄的剑? 
Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?

詹姆爵士坚守着对你侄女凯特琳·史塔克许下的承诺
Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.

他派我寻找并帮助珊莎 正如凯特琳希望的那样
He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted.

他赠我这把剑来保护她
He gave me this sword to protect her.

这是我在做并会继续做的事情 直到我死
That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.

她跟她母亲一模一样
She's exactly like her mother.

我没有足够的人手帮她夺回临冬城
I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.

你的人手比她多
You have more than she does.

她想夺回她的家 我理解
She wants her home back. I understand that.

如果詹姆·兰尼斯特想拿下它 他可以像任何人一样 用武力
And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.

我们需要给珊莎送封信
We need to get a raven north to Sansa.

国王要下诏? 
There's to be a royal announcement?

为什么没通知我? 
Why wasn't I informed?

国王将在大殿 颁布公告 就在此时此刻
There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.

你的位置在画廊 和宫廷里其她女人一起
Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.

爵士们 夫人们 信仰和王冠 是撑起这个世界的两个支柱
Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.

一个倒下 另一个也无法幸存
One collapses, so does the other.

天父审判我们所有人
The Father judges us all.

如果破坏他的规定 你将受到惩罚
If you break his laws...  you will be punished.

经过与总主教协商后 我们决定 洛拉斯·提利尔 和瑟曦·兰尼斯特的审判 将于圣母庆典的第一天 在贝勒大圣堂举行
After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei Lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

此外 经过无数祷告 和反思后 国王决定 从今日起 在整个七大王国内 比武审判将被禁止
Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

这项野蛮传统 是腐朽的统治者为了逃脱七神真正的审判 而设下的诡计
The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特和洛拉斯·提利尔 将会在七修士前受审 正如先祖的信仰一样
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.

愿七神保佑你们
Seven blessings to all.

陛下 你告诉我的那个谣言
Your Grace...  that old rumor you told me about.

我的小小鸟调查过了
My little birds investigated.

只是谣言 还是有什么别的? 
Was it just a rumor or something more?

你们也该高兴起来
You should both be happy as well.

不久之前 这座城市差点土崩瓦解
Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.

而现在它如获新生
Now it's like a man reborn.

女王归来之日 我才能高兴得起来
I will be happy when our queen returns.

不喝点吗? 你俩怎么都不喝酒? 
Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?

无垢者从不饮酒
Unsullied never drink.

规矩是谁定的? 
And who made these rules?

那些老混球根本不把你们当人看
Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human.

跟我喝一杯吧
Have a drink with me.

你呢? 你的借口是什么? 
And you? What's your excuse?

我之前尝过
I have tried wine before.

喝完感觉怪怪的
It made me feel funny.

那正是酒精的作用 你感觉得到
That's how you know it's working.

不喝的人都是对女王不敬
Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.

敬'风暴降生'丹妮莉丝 龙之母
To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,

镣铐破除者 女王万岁
Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.

女王万岁  女王万岁
Long may she reign.  Long may she reign.

喝起来一股馊味
Tastes like it has turned.

是啊 是啊 这就是发酵
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

只有我的挚友有资格品尝
Only my close friends could drink it.

讲个笑话吧 纳斯的弥桑黛
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

我不会讲笑话
I do not know any jokes.

三位领主走进一家酒馆… 史塔克 马泰尔和兰尼斯特
Three lords walk into a tavern a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

他们各点了一杯麦酒 酒保把酒端来时 他们却发现每人的杯中都有一只苍蝇
They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup.

兰尼斯特愤怒地把杯子推到一边 另要一杯
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.

马泰尔挑出了苍蝇 一口喝干了酒
The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.

史塔克把手伸进杯子 把苍蝇抓了出来 大吼
The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts,

'把酒吐出来 混球
'Spit it out, you wee shit.

这笑话在维斯特洛讲起来更有趣
It's funnier in Westeros.

我以为史塔克和兰尼斯特是敌人
The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.

讲笑话就像讲故事 灰虫子
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

不一定非要是真事
Not a true story, necessarily.

只要是逗你发笑的事就行
A story that's supposed to make you laugh ideally.

可能需要理解一下
Not at the moment, perhaps.

弥桑黛 你喜欢酒吗? 
Missandei, do you like the wine?

船快沉了 船上有两个翻译
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

第二个说 '不会 但是我会用十九种语言喊救命'
The second says, 'No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.'

这是我听过最烂的笑话

你连笑话是什么都不知道

I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?

你这样的出身 理应受到更好的待遇
A man of your birth deserves better.

我向你保证 从今往后 你都会吃好穿好
You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on.

不错 那… 那挺好的
Good, that's that's a fine thing.

我的叔叔永远不可能投降献出城堡 爵士
My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser.

无论你玩什么把戏
Whatever game you're playing.

The Blackfish is an old man.

他只求痛快一死
A good death is all he can hope for.

A son you sired on your wedding night.

我从未见过我的儿子 还有我的妻子 孩子的母亲 新婚夜之后我们就没见过面

说这话的人从背后一剑捅死了他的国王
Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.

我是不是让你感觉这是一场谈判? 
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation?

起码你自己清楚 你是个恶人
You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.

我把审判的事交给七神
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

呵呵 说得倒轻巧
Well, that is convenient for you.

你长相出众 嗯? 
You're a fine looking fellow, aren't you?

方下巴 金铠甲
Your square jaw, your golden armor.

告诉我 我想要知道
Tell me, I want to know.

你是如何自处的? 
How do you live with yourself?

咱俩都觉得 自己是体面人 对吧? 
All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we?

你在夜里睡觉的时候

想想过去的所作所为 是怎么说服自己 你是个体面人的?

我做过你姐姐的阶下囚
I was your sister's prisoner once.

没记错的话 她用石头砸过我的脑袋

她应该直接杀了你

也许吧 但她没有
Perhaps, but she didn't.

凯特琳·史塔克对我的恨意不逊于你
Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.

但我不恨她
But I didn't hate her.

远胜她的丈夫和儿子
Far more than her husband or her son.

你觉得我在乎你对他人的褒贬吗? 
Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?

不 但我还是要说 反正你是我的犯人
No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner.

你没得选
You don't have a choice.

她对她孩子的爱
The love she had for her children,

让我产生了一丝敬畏
I was a little awed by it.

让我想起了我姐姐
Reminded me of my sister.

我不是来和你互相羞辱的
I'm not here to trade insults.

你的姐姐很强大…   不要再谈论凯特!
Your sister was a strong   Don't talk about Cat!

我想聊谁就聊谁
I'll talk about whomever I want.

她深爱她的孩子
She loved her children.

我想所有的母亲都是如此 但凯特琳和瑟曦 有着世间罕见的凶猛
I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see.

她们为了保护自己的孩子会不择手段
They'd do anything to protect their babies.

将城市焚为灰烬 放走自己的死敌
Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies.

想想我们为爱都做了什么
The things we do for love.

你不是过来谈论我们的姐姐的
You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.

这正是我过来的原因
That's exactly why I came here.

你想笑就笑吧
You can laugh at that if you want.

随意嘲讽 没有关系
You can sneer. Doesn't matter.

为了回到她身边 我必须拿下奔流城
And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun.

我会把你的孩子找来
I'll send for your baby boy.

用投石机扔进奔流城
And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult.

因为我不在乎你 艾德慕公爵
Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure.

我不在乎你的儿子
Your son doesn't matter to me.

我更不在乎城堡里的人
The people in the castle don't matter to me.

如果我需要杀光每一个活着的徒利家族的人 才能回到她身边 我会动手的
And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do.

艾德慕·徒利 霍斯特·徒利之子 合法的奔流城公爵
Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

他是奔流城公爵
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

我必须服从他的命令
I have to obey his commands.

自从红色婚礼上他们谋杀了他的国王 他就做了俘虏到现在
He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.

在红色婚礼上谋杀了他的国王之人 为什么会放他回家呢? 
Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home?

因为这是个圈套 你个蠢货
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

他是我的领主 大人
He's my lord, my lord.

我宣誓效忠奔流城公爵 服从他的命令
I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.

你不是在听艾德慕的命令
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

你是在听他妈的弑君者的命令

你的家人在北境 和我们一起走
Your family is in the North. Come with us.

既然能为家人一战 何必为荣誉而死
Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.

你侍奉珊莎 做得远比我好
You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.

搜这里! 快走
Check that out!  Go on, now.

好多年没正经跟人比划过了
I haven't had a proper sword fight in years.

怕是会出洋相吧
I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.

我们找到黑鱼了 大人
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

He died fighting, my lord.

我错了 我承认认错有用吗? 
I was wrong. I admit it.  That changes nothing.

无垢者能在滩头构筑防线
The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead.

我承认这一点 我正…
And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying

你在告诉我军队应该做什么
You're trying to tell me what the army should do.

但你不知道军队该做什么
You do not know what the army should do.

好吧 那军队该做些什么? 
All right, what should the army do?

我们不去滩头
We'll not go to the beach.

我们要是去了滩头 伟主们就会攻下大金字塔
If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid.

金字塔是城里唯一适合防守的地方
The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend.

我们就留在这然后呢
We stay here.  And then?

我们等他们来找我们
We wait for them to come to us.

你他妈的来这干嘛? 
What the fuck you doing here?

罪名是什么? 
Any particular reason?

他们是我们的人 曾经是
They're our men. Or they were.

他们袭击了附近的一个圣堂 杀害了村民
They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers.

你为什么找他们?

不介意再来一次
Happy to do it again.

放下箭 小娘们
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

有比你更厉害的小姑娘试过要杀我
Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.

可以给你一个
You can have one of them.

我们不是屠夫 得用绞刑
We're not butchers. We hang them.

一眨眼就完事了
All over in an instant.

惩罚在哪呢? 
Where's the punishment in that?

死亡就是惩罚我们都他妈会死
They die.  We all bloody die.

除了这家伙
Except this one here.

我就砍这一个
I'll only gut one of them.

那我剁只手
I'll chop off one hand.

你失去了朋友 我们出于尊重才让你来处决他们三人中的两个
We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.

要是过去 我为了宰了这三个人 可以把你们七个全杀了
There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.

你不复当年了 克里冈
You're getting old, Clegane.

不要啊 我什么都给你
Please don't. I'll give you anything.

你应该加入我们 我们用得上你
You ought to join us. We could use you.

我试着加入了 没半点用
I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.

他给了一个颓废的醉鬼红袍僧 可以复活他的法力是有原因的

这世上人们做了多少肮脏龌龊的事 就为了所谓比自己更重要的东西
Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.

北境寒风渐起
Cold winds are rising in the North.

你要去阻止它么? 
And you're going to go stop them?

我们需要好手来帮忙
We need good men to help us.

上次你见到我的时候想要弄死我
Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.

但光之王赐予你力量来打败我
But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me.

我打败你 因为我比你强 贝里
I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric.

在你哭哭啼啼地嚷着你那个王之前比你强 现在还你比强
I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now.

是啊 你也许是对的
Aye, you're probably right.

你天生就是战士
You were born a fighter.

但你从战场上跑下来了
You walked away from the fight.

好人坏人 老老少少 我们为之战斗的东西会把他们一并毁掉
Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.

你害过很多人 克里冈 但你现在可以帮助更多的人
You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.

还来得及
It's not too late for you.

如果你完成了任务 她本该毫无痛苦地死去
If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.

千面之神被许诺了一个名字
The Many Faced God was promised a name.

他必须收到属于他的东西

你改变不了的
You can't change that.

而现在 他被许诺了另外一个名字
And now he's been promised another name.

这一切就要结束了
It will all be over soon.

跪下受降 还是要接着跑? 
On your knees or on your feet?

我们不是分出高下了么? 
Haven't we been through this already?

你让她杀了我
You told her to kill me.

女孩终成无名之辈

女孩是临冬城的艾莉亚·史塔克 我要回家了
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.

不管看起来如何 我想你会发现这座城市是有起色的
Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.

我看我们还是找些掩护吧
Perhaps we should take shelter.

这座城市有起色? 
The city's on the rise?

集市重开 商业恢复
Commerce has returned to the markets.

人民支持你
The people are behind you.

恩 当然 并不是所有人
Well, not all the people, of course.

没有一个统治者能得到所有人的支持
No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people.

但这场战争的起因是弥林的重生
But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence.

奴隶主不会让弥林成功的
The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.

但如果弥林成功的话 一个没有奴隶制 没有奴隶主的城市存在于世
Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters...

会证明没人需要奴隶主
...it proves that no one needs a Master.

我会把奴隶主钉上十字架
I will crucify the Masters.

我会焚毁他们的舰队 杀尽他们军队的每一个士兵 把他们的城市夷为平地
I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt.

你跟我说过 你知道你父亲是个怎样的人
You once told me you knew what your father was.

那你知道当兰尼斯特军队抵达君临城的时候 他的计划是什么吗? 
Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?

好吧 他告诉了我的哥哥 而詹姆告诉了我
Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me.

他在红堡下面藏了很多野火 在公会大厅 在贝勒大圣堂 以及所有的交通要道
He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares.

他想烧死城内他所有的臣民
He would have burned every one of his citizens.

忠臣和叛徒
The loyal ones and the traitors.

男人 女人和孩子
Every man, woman, and child.

所以詹姆杀了他
That's why Jaime killed him.

这是完全不同的
This is entirely different.

你说的是摧毁那些城市啊
You're talking about destroying cities.

所以并不是完全不同
It's not entirely different.

我想还有另一种办法
I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.

之前 我提议过和平解决
Once before, I offered you peace.

若你不是那么傲慢 你本可以带着一支舰队返回家乡
If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.

现在吗 你将徒步逃离奴隶湾 像一个真正的乞丐女王那样
Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.

我们是来商谈投降条款的 不是来互相辱骂的
We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.

条款很简单
The terms are simple.

你和你的异域朋友必须放弃大金字塔和弥林城
You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.

你从克拉兹尼・莫・纳克罗兹那儿偷来的无垢者 会转售给价高者
The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.

你从克拉兹尼・莫・纳克罗兹那儿偷来的通译 也会转售给价高者
The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.

大金字塔下面的几头龙必须杀掉
The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.

看来我们没有表达清楚
We obviously didn't communicate clearly.

我们来这儿是来商讨你们的投降条款 而不是我的
We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.

我知道 让自己适应现实 有些困难
I imagine it's difficult adjusting to the new reality.

我的统治才刚刚开始
My reign has just begun.

感谢你们的舰队
Thank you for the armada.

女王陛下的确喜欢舰船
Our queen does love ships.

那么 我们上一次谈判的时候达成了一个协议
Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.

但你们违反了这个协议
You violated that pact.

举兵攻打我们
You declared war upon us.

虽说女王陛下宽厚仁慈 但挑起战争是不能被原谅的
Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.

女王陛下坚持要你们其中的一个人死 以示惩戒
Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.

别人的死看上去 总是无关紧要 是不是? 
It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?

对 他 他不是我们一伙的
Yes, him. He's not one of us.

他是外人 出身低下
He's an outsider, a lowborn.

他不为我们说话
He does not speak for us.

把这发生的事告诉你的人
Tell your people what happened here.

告诉他们你是因为女王陛下的仁慈才活下来
Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty.

他们要是想来寻仇 或者想恢复奴隶城邦过去的荣耀时 提醒他们 在'风暴降生'丹妮莉丝和她的龙来到弥林之后都发生了什么
When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind them what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.

你不必来的
You don't have to be here.

我想死你了
I've missed you terribly.

谢谢你将波顿夫人安然无恙地送还
Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely.

现在 下马然后跪在我面前 交出军队 承认我是真正的临冬城公爵和北境守护
Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

我就赦免你背弃守夜人的罪
I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch.

也会赦免这些背叛我家族的领主们
I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house.

按我说的做 杂种 你没有人手 没有马匹 你也没有临冬城
Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell.

为什么要让这些可怜虫白白送死呢? 
Why lead those poor souls into slaughter?

没必要打仗
There's no need for a battle.

下马 下跪
Get off your horse and kneel.

没必要打仗
There's no need for a battle.

数以千计的人也不用死
Thousands of men don't need to die.

让我们用古老的办法来解决
Let's end this the old way.

我听了不少你的故事 杂种
I keep hearing stories about you, bastard.

北境人说起你时 总说你的剑术是有史以来最好的
The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked.

也许你确实有那么好
Maybe you are that good.

我不知道自己能否打败你
I don't know if I'd beat you.

但我知道我的军队会击败你的军队
But I know that my army will beat yours.

你有我的一半多吗? 
You have, what, half that?

是啊 你人多
Aye, you have the numbers.

当你的人得知你不会为他们而战时 他们是否还会为你而战呢? 
Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?

他很厉害 非常厉害
He's good. Very good.

告诉我 你会眼睁睁看你弟弟死去 仅仅因为你太过骄傲不肯投降吗? 
Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?

我们怎么知道他真在你手里? 
How do we know you have him?

现在 如果你想救…
Now, if you want to save...

你明天就将受死 波顿大人
You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

你妹妹是个不错的女人
She's a fine woman, your sister.

我很期待她回到我的枕边
I look forward to having her back in my bed.

你们也都是英俊的汉子
And you're all finelooking men.

我的狗非常渴望见到你们
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

七天没给它们喂食了 它们饥饿难耐
I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous.

不知道它们会先吃哪个部位呢
I wonder which parts they'll try first.

很快便见分晓
We'll find out soon enough.

早上见吧 杂种
In the morning, then, bastard.

他要是聪明 就会待在 临冬城内等我们出动
If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

这不是他的作风 他知道北境人都在观望
That's not his way. He knows the North is watching.

如果其他家族嗅到他的弱点 他们便不再惧怕他
If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him.

他不能接受这个 恐惧是他的力量之源
He can't have that. Fear is his power.

这也是他的弱点 他的士兵不想为他而战
It's his weakness, too. His men don't want to fight for him.

他们被迫为他而战 若他们感到大势已去…
They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...

我担心的不是他的士兵
It's not his men that worry me.

我知道骑兵的能耐
I know what mounted knights can do to us.

你和史坦尼斯轻而易举击溃了我们 就像往雪地里撒尿
You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.

我们在侧翼挖好堑壕
We're digging trenches all along our flanks.

他们便不能通过两翼包围 像史坦尼斯击溃你们一样击溃我们
They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.

没办法从两翼攻击我们
They won't be able to hit us from the sides.

关键是要引诱他们主动发起冲锋
It's crucial that we let them charge at us.

敌众我寡 我们需要耐心
They've got the numbers, we need the patience.

如果让他冲进我们的阵型中央 他会继续追击
If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue.

届时我们便将他三面包围
Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.

你真认为那娘们会和你们正大光明地打仗? 
Did you really think that cunt would fight you mantoman?

但我想激怒他
But I wanted to make him angry.

我想让他朝我们全速扑来
I want him coming at us full tilt.

我们应该睡会儿
We should all get some sleep.

歇息吧 琼恩・雪诺 我们明天还需要你保持清醒
Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.

现在 你已经见过你的对手 也拟定了战术
So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.

是啊 但愿能管用
Aye, for what they're worth.

你对他的了解仅凭一面之缘 你和你亲信的顾问们 就凑在一块儿 制定计划 对付这个你们并不知根知底的人
You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around making your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know.

我了解他的思维方式
I know the way his mind works.

我知道他多么喜欢伤害别人
I know how he likes to hurt people.

你有没有想过 我或许对此有些见解? 
Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?

你以为他会落入你的陷阱
You think he's going to fall into your trap.

不会的 他才是那个设下陷进的人
He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

他太过自负 他喜欢玩游戏
He's overconfident. He plays with people.

他在这方面比你强很多 他这辈子都在玩弄别人
He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.

是啊 我这辈子都在干什么? 耍扫帚吗? 
Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks?

我在塞外交手的敌人比拉姆斯・波顿更可怕
I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton.

我打败过比拉姆斯・波顿更恐怖的对手 守卫了长城
I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

我们该怎么做? 我们要怎么救回瑞肯? 
What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?

我们救不回他
We'll never get him back.

瑞肯是奈德・史塔克的嫡子 这使他对拉姆斯造成的威胁 比你这个私生子和我这个女儿大得多
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

只要他还活着 拉姆斯对临冬城的权利就充满争议 这就意味着 他活不长
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.

我们不能放弃我们的弟弟
We can't give up on our brother.

听我说 拜托 他就是想让你犯错
Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.

他当然想 但我又能怎么做呢? 
Of course he does. What should I do differently?

我不知道! 我对战争一无所知
I don't know! I don't know anything about battles.

只是不要正中他的下怀
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

是啊 这是个好建议
Aye, that's good advice.

你觉得这很无聊吗? 
You think that's obvious?

对 这是有一点无聊
Well, it is a bit obvious.

如果你早点问我的建议
If you had asked for my advice earlier,

我会告诉你不要攻打临冬城 直到我们兵力更强 这是不是也很无聊? 
I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we had a larger force, or is that obvious, too?

我们何时兵力才能更强? !
When will we have a larger force?!

我们向所有可能支持我们的家族求过援了
We've pleaded with every house that'll have us.

黑鱼没法帮助我们
The Blackfish can't help us.

我们有这么多人已经很幸运了
We're lucky to have this many men.

这还不够! 是 是不够 但这是我们的全部了!
It's not enough! No, it's not enough. It's what we have!

有许多战斗在更恶劣的条件下赢过
Battles have been won against greater odds.

我不要活着回去
I'm not going back there alive.

你懂我的意思吗? 
Do you understand me?

我永远不会再让他碰你
I won't let ever let him touch you again.

我会保护你 我保证
I'll protect you, I promise.

没人能保护我
No one can protect me.

人不能靠别人保护
No one can protect anyone.

你觉得还有希望? 
You think there's hope?

我还从没看过这些波顿混蛋们打仗
I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight.

他们也从没看过自由民打仗 所以 是的 还有希望
And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope.

你想替你的国王复仇 不是吗? 
You want to avenge your king, don't you?

打败史坦尼斯的不是波顿
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.

是史坦尼斯自己
It was Stannis himself.

他提拔了我 让我身居高位
He lifted me up and made me something.

但总有恶魔在他脑海中恶毒地低语
But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.

你见到这些恶魔了?  什么? 
You saw these demons? What?

不 这只是一种表达方式
No, it's a manner of speaking.

并不是… 实际存在的恶魔
Not... actual demons.

好吧 你喜欢混球史坦尼斯 我则喜欢被他烧死的那个人
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned.

曼斯的脑海里没有什么恶魔
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

他从不烧人 也不听信什么红女巫
He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.

我以为他会是那个带领我们度过长夜的人
I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.

但我也错了 和你一样
But I was wrong just like you.

也许说到底是我们的错 就不该相信什么国王
Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.

琼恩・雪诺不是国王
Jon Snow's not a king.

开战前夜 我得痛饮一番才睡得着
I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.

我有一罐酸羊奶 比你们这些南方娘炮的葡萄汁 强到不知哪里去了
I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.

不用了 谢谢 听起来挺好喝的 但我还是保持头脑清醒的好
No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head.

开战前夜我从来睡不着觉
I can never sleep the night before a battle.

那你一整晚都干些啥? 
So what do you do all night?

边走边想 直到离营地够远 没人能听到我裤裆里失禁的声音
Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.

梅丽珊卓
红袍祭司

您没参加战前会议
You weren't at the war council.

如果我输掉 如果我死了… 别再复活我了
If I do, if I fall...  don't bring me back.

我命令你别再复活我了
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

我不是你的仆人 琼恩・雪诺
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

你在我的营地里 我是指挥官
You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

我侍奉光之王
I serve the Lord of Light.

我执行他的命令
I do what he commands.

您怎么知道他的命令? 
How do you know what he commands?

我揭示他带来的预兆… 尽我所能
I interpret his signs...  as well as I can.

如果光之王不想让我复活你 我又怎能做到呢? 
If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back?

我只有他赐予我的 而他把你赐予了我
Only what he gives me and he gave me you.

也许你只在他的计划里扮演一个小角色 之后就没用了
Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else.

也许他复活你只是为了让你再死一次
Maybe he brought you here to die again.

什么样的神会做出这种事来? 
What kind of god would do something like that?

上次我们见面还是在临冬城 对吧? 
Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes?

如果我的记忆没错 你好像拿我的身高开过玩笑
You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall.

每一个拿侏儒的身高开玩笑的人 都以为自己是唯一一个开这种玩笑的
Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.

你们讲的笑话无外乎这么五六个
You're all making the same five or six jokes.

那是很久以前的事了 没错
It was a long time ago. It was.

从那以后你过得又怎样呢? 
And how have things been going for you since then?

我看不太顺吧
Not so well, I gather.

难以想象你要是顺风顺水 还会谋杀史塔克家的孩子们
Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.

我没杀史塔克家的孩子
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

虽然我做过同样恶劣的事 甚至更糟
But I did things that were just as bad or worse.

他也为此付出了代价
And he paid for them.

看起来可没有
Doesn't seem like it.

我敢肯定这对你来说一定很复杂 在临冬城长大
It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell.

从来都不太清楚自己究竟是谁
Never quite knowing who you were.

不过呢 我们每个人的生活都很复杂 不是吗? 
But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?

你们为我们带来了铁舰队的一百艘船 以及驾驶它们的船员
You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.

作为回报 我想你们希望我 支持你对铁群岛王位的要求? 
In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?

你有什么问题? 
And what's wrong with you?

至少我们在这点上可以达成共识
We can agree upon that at least.

铁群岛有过女王吗? 
Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?

跟维斯特洛一样
No more than Westeros.

我们的叔叔攸伦在失踪许久后回了家
Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.

他谋杀了我们的父亲 抢走了属于亚拉的海盐王座
He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

如果我们留下 也会被他杀掉
He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.

提利昂大人告诉我 你们的父亲是个差劲的国王
Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.

您和我在父亲这点上也一样
You and I have that in common.

我们的父亲也都死于篡夺者之手
And both murdered by a usurper as well.

他们的船足够载我们的人吗? 
Will their ships be enough?

加上之前伟主们的舰队 或许吧
With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.

铁舰队不止一百艘船
There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.

是的 而攸伦还在建造更多船
There are and Euron is building more.

他打算把这些船都献给您
He's going to offer them to you.

那我为什么不等他来呢? 
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

他带来的不止铁舰队
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

他还要…
He also wants to give you...

要你接受他那根巨大的话儿 我记得他说过
His big cock, I think he said.

您瞧 攸伦的礼物同时也是一份婚约
Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see.

如果您不接受 也就得不到船
You won't get one without the other.

那我想你们的礼物是不含联姻要求的喽? 
And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?

我从不提要求 但任何事情我都乐意尝试 真的
I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.

他杀了我们的父亲 也会杀了我们
He murdered our father and would have murdered us.

一旦他得到想要的 也立马会杀了您
He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.

而你们不想要七国? 
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

您的祖先击败了我们的祖先 夺走了铁群岛
Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands.

我们请求你还回来
We ask you to give them back.

我们还希望您能帮我们杀掉一两个 觉得女人不适合统治的叔叔
We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

要是所有人都来要求独立怎么办? 
What if everyone starts demanding their independence?

她不是要求 而是请求
She's not demanding, she's asking.

其他人也可以这样请求
The others are free to ask as well.

我们几个人的父亲都不是什么好人
Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.

他们留给我们一个被他们搞得一团糟的世界
They left the world worse than they found it.

我们不能像他们一样
We're not going to do that.

我们要留下一个更好的世界
We're going to leave the world better than we found it.

你将助我登上七国女王之位 维护七国的统一
You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.

不再烧杀劫掠 奸淫无道
No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.

这是我们的生存方式
That's our way of life.

你喜欢游戏么 小家伙? 
Do you like games, little man?

你越早到他那 就能越早跟他重逢
The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him again.

不 你得跑 记得么? 
No, you have to run, remember?

冲! 冲啊! 跟着指挥官!
Go! Go! Follow your commander!

会伤了自己人的 放下
We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.

我们留在这也是等着挨操
We may as well be taking shits back here.

北境属于谁? 我们!
Who owns the North? We do!

北境属于谁? 我们!
Who owns the North? We do!

跟我上 小伙子们! 打破他们的封锁!
With me, lads! Break their line!

托蒙德! 把他拉回来!
Tormund! Get him back!

他们全军覆没是我们全军覆没
Their army's gone. Our army's gone.

他们没有围城的人 我们只需要等
They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.

你之前建议一对一决斗 是吧? 
You suggested oneonone combat, didn't you?

我觉得这是个绝妙的主意
I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.

把我弟弟埋进地下墓窖 挨着我父亲
We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.

这就是我要呆的地方么? 
Is this where I'll be staying now?

我们在一起的时间就要到头了
Our time together is about to come to an end.

你的言语会消失
Your words will disappear.

你的家族会消失
Your house will disappear.

你的姓氏会消失
Your name will disappear.

关于你的一切将永远消失
All memory of you will disappear.

我的猎犬绝对不会伤害我
My hounds will never harm me.

你已经七天没有喂过它们了
You haven't fed them in seven days.

你自己说的
You said it yourself.

它们是忠犬
They're loyal beasts.

但现在它们饿疯了
Now they're starving.

审判即将开始
The trial will be getting under way soon.

你是否已准备好在七神面前接受审判 承认罪行抑或证明清白
Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?

不必审判了
There'll be no need for a trial.

我在七神面前坦白 完全承认我所犯之罪
I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.

你将坦白哪些罪行? 
To which crimes will you be confessing?

我和男人睡觉 其中包括叛国者蓝礼·拜拉席恩
I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

我在诸神面前发了伪誓
I perjured myself before the gods.

我堕落 不诚 放荡 自负 因而有罪
I am guilty of depravity...  dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance.

我服从七神旨意 接受任何诸神认为公正的惩罚
I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.

诸神的惩罚是残忍的 也是公平的
The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair.

战士对自以为可以逍遥法外之人 施以惩罚
The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice.

而圣母则对跪在她面前的人 示以仁慈
But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.

我对我犯下的罪行负全部责任 我放弃我所有的欲望
I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires.

如今我唯愿 献身于七神
My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven.

愿我成为前车之鉴 以为教训
May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.

你完全明白 这意味着什么吗? 
You understand fully what this means?

我将放弃提利尔之名 及与家族相关的一切
I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it.

我将放弃贵族身份及在高庭的一切权利
I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden.

永不娶妻 永不生子
I will never marry and I will never father children.

我要求你将生命献于七神
...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.

你会为了保卫自己的信仰 与异教徒和叛教者斗争到底吗? 
Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?

不 我不能让他们…
No, I can't let them...

信仰才是正道 父亲
Faith is the way, Father.

我要赶去参加审判了
I'm late for the trial.

你承诺过的
You gave me your word.

我信守承诺
And I have kept my word.

一旦王太后的审判结束
Once the queen mother's trial is concluded,

洛拉斯兄弟将被释放
Brother Loras is free to leave.

那么王太后现在何处? 
And where is the queen mother?

她的坐轿从未离开红堡
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

看起来王太后并不想出席她的审判
It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.

去红堡 把她带来
Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

恐怕在别的地方
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

这是什么意思? 
What's the meaning of this?

我还有更重要的事情要做 这是在浪费我的时间…
I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence...

别急 大学士 我对你并无恶意
Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will.

如果可以 请原谅我
Please forgive me if you can.

我也不忍心这样 大人
This pains me, my lord.

无论您做错过什么 您都不应孤独地死在 这样一个冰冷黑暗的地方
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

但有时我们唯有辞旧 才能迎新
But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.

你躲得越久 下场越惨
The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you.

事情有些不对
There's something wrong.

您不必担心 陛下
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

审判不久便会开始
The trial will begin shortly.

瑟曦不在这里 托曼也不在
Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.

你觉得他们为什么不在? 
Why do you think they're not here?

如果被控告之人不到场 她的审判仍要进行
If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless.

谁都不能摆脱诸神的裁决…
We cannot escape the justice of the gods...

忘了你那些神吧 现在听我说!
Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you!

瑟曦知道她不到场的后果 而她还是没来 这意味着她不打算承担这些后果
Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.

推迟审判 我们必须全部离开
The trial can wait. We all need to leave.

我们现在必须全部离开!
We all need to leave now!

让我过去 让我过去
Let me through. Let me through.

坦白 这令人愉悦
Confess. It felt good.

殴打我 饿着我 恐吓我 羞辱我
Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me.

你这样做不是因为你关心我能否赎罪
You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.

你这样做是因为这令你愉悦
You did it because it felt good.

我做什么事情也是因为这令我愉悦
I do things because they feel good.

我喝酒因为这样令我愉悦
I drink because it feels good.

我杀死了丈夫因为摆脱他纠缠令我愉悦
I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him.

我睡我的亲弟弟因为他进入我令我愉悦
I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me.

关于睡我弟弟这一点我撒谎了… 因为能让我们的儿子远离可恶的伪君子 这令我愉悦
I lie about fucking my brother...  because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites.

我杀了你的大麻雀… 还有他的小麻雀们… 所有的修士 修女 所有他那些肮脏的士兵 因为看着他们烧成灰烬 这令人愉悦
I killed your High Sparrow...  and all his little sparrows...  all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn.

想象一下他们的震惊和痛苦 真是令人愉悦
It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain.

没有什么更快乐的事了
No thought has ever given me greater joy.

时机对了 连坦白都这么令人愉悦
Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.

你一直都很沉默
You've always been quiet.

我说过 我会是你死之前看到的最后一个人
I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died.

我很高兴能看到你
I'm glad to see your face.

我已经准备好迎接七神
I'm ready to meet the gods.

你今天不会死
You're not going to die today.

你得要好一阵子才能死
You're not going to die for quite a while.

这位是格雷果·克里冈爵士
This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

你的神已经抛弃你了
Your gods have forsaken you.

现在 信奉他为神吧
This is your god now.

我很抱歉  陛下
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

希望我们的友谊 万古长青
May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.

愿我们戳翻敌人的时候 念叨着同样的话
And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance,

如果你每次都搞丢 每次都要我们来替你夺回地盘 那我们要你有何用? 
If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?

陛下  没必要…
Your Grace, there's no need...

您对陛下的葬礼有什么想法? 
What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?

鉴于贝勒大圣堂已不再适合 或许在王座厅举行仪式?

他们对即将到来的事一无所知
They have no idea what's coming for them.

再见 达里奥·纳哈里斯

我知道对你而言很难说出口
I know it was hard for you.

你拒绝了一个真正爱你的男人 就因为他可能成为你在七大王国的负担
You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

但正是这种自我牺牲 让你成为一个伟大的统治者 如果这么说能安慰你的话
That's the kind of selfsacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation.

I'm terrible at consoling.

好 那来谈谈眼前发生的一切吧?

只是不耐烦得说出来
Just impatient to get on with it.

他不是第一个爱你的人 也不会是最后一个
He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.

好吧 你安慰我这件事 彻底失败了
Well, you have completely failed to console me.

好吧 听我说 自打记事起 我就是个愤世嫉俗的人
For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember.

每个人都和我说 让我信点什么… 家庭 七神 国王 我自己
Everyone's always asking me to believe in things...  family, gods, kings, myself.

听起来非常诱人 直到我看见信仰把人们变成什么样子
It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people.

所以我说不 你们还是把信仰留给自己吧
So I said no, thank you to belief.

很尴尬 真的
It's embarrassing, really.

我都可以拔剑起誓 可惜我没有佩剑

Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?

告诉他们立刻过来
Tell them to come here now.

切开他们可不那么容易
They weren't easy to carve.

尤其是黑瓦德
Especially Black Walder.

我的名字是艾莉亚·史塔克
My name is Arya Stark.

艾莉亚·史塔克
'奈德'和凯特琳的次女

我希望你知道
I want you to know that.

你这辈子所见的最后一件事 就是死时看着史塔克家族的人冲你微笑
The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.

原谅我 小姐 如果我打断了你的祈祷…
Forgive me, my lady...  if you're at prayer.

我已经不再祈祷了
I'm done with all that.

在我还是个小女孩时 每天都来这里
I came here every day when I was a girl.

祈祷自己能去别的地方
I prayed to be somewhere else.

那时 我只想到自己想要什么 从没想过我拥有什么
Back then I only thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.

我以为你知道
I thought you knew what I wanted.

每次需要做决定前
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

我都会闭上眼睛 看到同一个画面
I close my eyes and see the same picture.

把它拽出脑海 放到现实中?

It's a pretty picture.

这场大战的消息很快会传遍七大王国

所有人都会知道 我为史塔克家族而战
I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.

你也曾效忠过别的家族 贝里席大人
You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.

可你从未停止过为自己谋利
It's never stopped you from serving yourself.

过去的已经过去
The past is gone for good.

你可以坐在这感伤时光的流逝 或者去为未来做好准备
You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future.

你 吾爱 就是史塔克家族的未来
You, my love, are the future of House Stark.

北境联盟会站在谁的身后? 
Who should the North rally behind?

是奈德与凯特琳·史塔克在临冬城 生下的嫡女 还是生于南方没有母亲的私生子? 
A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?

我们就此别过吧
This is where I leave you.

你不跟我们一起走吗? 
You're not coming with us?

你不能指望着谷地的骑士 与野人侵略者们并肩而战

自由民 北方人 以及谷地的骑士们共同英勇杀敌 并肩奋战 方才取得胜利
The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won.

Still you refused the call.

但莫尔蒙家族不忘
But House Mormont remembers.

除史塔克之外再无北境之王
We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.

我不在乎他是否是私生子
I don't care if he's a bastard.

他流着奈德·史塔克的血液
Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.

从今天直到最后 他都是我的国王

莫尔蒙小姐的话不中听 却是真话

我的儿子为少狼主罗柏·史塔克而死

你需要时 我并没有派军队出征

因为我不想更多曼德勒家族的人无谓送死

House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.

而我将站在琼恩·雪诺的身后… 北境之王!
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...  the King in the North!

北境之王!
The King in the North!

北境之王! 北境之王!
The King in the North! The King in the North!

我现在宣布 兰尼斯特家族的瑟曦

Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

七国统治者暨全境守护者
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

你们都很疑惑 我为什么让你们聚在这里
You're wondering why I brought you all here.

毕竟 我们才刚刚举行了一次盛宴
After all, we just had a feast.

上一次老家伙 在两周之内举行两场宴会是什么时候的事了? 
Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?

如果不能和家族一起庆祝 还算什么河间地之主啊

I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.

你们是我的族人 为我倾囊相助的人 在血色婚礼上帮我剿灭史塔克家族

就在你们家里 把所有邀请来的客人屠戮殆尽

But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.

不 不 这是你们犯的错
No, no, that was your mistake.

你们该把他们全族歼灭 连根拔起
You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.

若一狼尚存 羊群便永不得安
Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.

当人们问起你这里发生了什么… 你就告诉他们北境永不遗忘

每一个年龄在十岁到六十岁之间的人 都要每天练习长枪 尖矛和弓箭技艺
Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

这些在长夏出生的男孩 是时候学学怎么战斗了
It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.

一半人作战 不足以保卫北境

我可不打算在男人为我打仗的时候 自己在炉火旁边做针线活
I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me.

葛洛佛大人 或许我个头比较小 还是个姑娘 但我身体里流淌着北境人的血液 与你分毫不差
I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.

这话没错 夫人 没人质疑这点…
Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned...

要守卫北境 我可不需要由你批准
And I don't need your permission to defend the North.

接下来 我们将会训练熊岛上的男女老少
We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

在备战的同时 我们得加固防线
While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses.

当前阻挡着亡灵大军的只有长城 数百年来 长城并未得到妥善管理
The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall, and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries.

我不是自由民之王
I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

但倘若我们想共同渡过这个严冬…
But if we're going to survive this winter together...

你是让我们去驻守那些堡垒? 
You want us to man the castles for you?

上一次见到夜王 还是在艰难屯
Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome.

而离艰难屯最近的地方 是东海望
The closest castle to Hardhome is EastwatchbytheSea.

那我就去那儿
Then that's where I'll go.

似乎我们都成了守夜人
Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

如果异鬼突破了长城 在它们南下之路上还有两个城堡 最后壁炉城和卡霍城
If they breach the Wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.

可安柏家和卡史塔克家背叛了北境
The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North.

约恩·罗伊斯
'青铜约恩'谷地领主

他们的城堡也应当被摧毁 片瓦不留
Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.

城堡可是无辜的
The castles committed no crimes.

更何况我们需要它们来应对接下来的战斗
And we need every fortress we have for the war to come.

那我们应当把这两座堡垒交给其他家族 作为回报 感谢他们效忠我们 共同对抗拉姆斯
We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.

安柏家族和卡史塔克家族 为史塔克家效力数百年
The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries.

一代代人誓约忠诚
They've kept faith for generation after generation.

可他们却背信弃义
And then they broke faith.

我不会仅仅因为部分人犯下的罪 把这两个家族的后人赶出他们代代相传的古堡
I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.

难道背叛就不应该受罚?  难道忠诚就不应该嘉奖? 
So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?

死亡正是背叛的惩罚
The punishment for treason is death.

小琼恩·安柏死在战场上
Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle.

霍拉德·卡史塔克死在战场上
Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.

他们是为拉姆斯战死的
They died fighting for Ramsay.

这些城堡应赏赐给效忠于你的家族 他们可是为你而死
Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.

当我担任守夜人总司令时…
When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch...

我处决了背叛我的人
I executed men who betrayed me.

我处决了拒不听令的人
I executed men who refused to follow orders.

父亲常说 我试着去遵照父亲的教诲而活
My father always said, and I have tried to live by those words.

但我不会因某人犯下了罪 就迁怒于他的后代 我也不会把这些家族的后人 从世代生活的城堡中赶走
But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries.

我已经做出了决定 无需再议
That is my decision, and my decision is final.

上百年来 我们的家族 一直并肩作战
For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield.

我要求你们以封臣的身份 再一次向史塔克家族效忠 无论何时 听从号令
I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.

之前的恩怨都一笔勾销
Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.

北境要团结起来 所有活着的北境人
The North needs to band together, all the living north.

奈德和亚丽 你们是否效忠我?  从一而终? 
Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?

你是我的妹妹 但如今我是北境之王
You are my sister, but I am king now.

看来要给你准备顶王冠啰? 
Will you start wearing a crown?

你当着其他领主的面 质疑我的决定时 就是在拆我的台
When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.

我现在都不能质疑你的决定了? 
So I can't question your decisions anymore?

你当然可以 但…
Of course you can, but...

乔佛里从不准别人质疑他的权威
Joffrey never let anyone question his authority.

难道你认为他是个好国王? 
You think he was a good king?

你认为我会像乔佛里一样? 
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

你是我见过的人里最不像乔佛里的
You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.

你擅长这个 你知道的
You're good at this, you know.

他们发自内心地尊敬你 可你得…
They respect you, they really do, but you have to...

你笑什么? 
Why are you laughing?

父亲常说什么来着? 
What did father used to say?

'但是'前面的所有话都是胡扯
Everything before the word 'but' is horse shit.

他从未对我说过这话
He never said that to me.

不 不 父亲不会在女儿面前吐脏话的
No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.

那是因为他想要保护我们
Because he was trying to protect us.

他不想让我们见到真实世界的丑恶 但父亲始终没能保护我 你也是
He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but father couldn't protect me and neither can you.

好 好 我不会再护着你了 你也别再拆我台
All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.

我才不是要拆你台!
I'm not trying to undermine you!

你得比父亲更聪明
You have to be smarter than father.

比罗柏更聪明
You need to be smarter than Robb.

我爱他们 想念他们 可他们确实犯了傻 还因此丢了性命
I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.

那我该怎么做才算是更聪明? 
And how should I be smarter?

这么做真那么糟糕吗? 
Would that be so terrible?

陛下 这是君临的来信
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

'兰尼斯特家族的瑟曦一世
'Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name,

安达尔人与先民的女王
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

七国统治者暨全境守护者… '
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms...'

她要我们到君临去
Come to King's Landing.

向她求饶 否则就准备接受叛乱者的命运
Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.

你一直忧心于北边的敌人 却忽略了南方的强敌
You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.

我之所以对夜王忧心忡忡 是因为我亲眼见到了他
I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him.

相信我 如果你也见到了他 不可能置之不顾
And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.

我们和夜王之间毕竟还有道墙
We still have a wall between us and the Night King.

我们和瑟曦之间可什么都没有
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

我们和瑟曦之间相隔千里
There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei.

凛冬已至 兰尼斯特军队是南方之敌
Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army.

他们从未深入如此之北
They've never ranged this far north.

你是个军人 但我更了解她
You're the military man, but I know her.

如果你与瑟曦为敌 她会摧毁你 不达目的不罢休
If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you.

但凡有人想阻挠她 她都会千方百计先杀了你
Everyone who's ever crossed her, She's found a way to murder.

听起来你好像很钦佩她
You almost sound as if you admire her.

我只是从她身上学到很多罢了
I learned a great deal from her.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

我们等待了一辈子的一切
It's what we've been waiting for our whole lives.

父亲教育我们的目的就在于此 不管他是否意识得到
It's what father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.

他让我记住每一个该死的城市 小镇 河流 森林 还有山脉
Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.

现在都是我们的了 只要去拿过来就好
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

自从回家后 你一直沉默寡言
You've been quiet since you came home.

在生我的气么? 
Are you angry with me?

那就是在怕我咯? 
Are you afraid of me?

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安已经有提利昂作为女王之手了
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.

而现在他们正渡过狭海而来 企图夺回她父亲的王座
Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne.

我们的弟弟 你深爱的那个弟弟 被你放走的弟弟 杀害了我们的父亲和长子的弟弟 如今他和我们的敌人并肩作战 还为他们出谋划策
Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our firstborn son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel.

在船上逍遥快活
He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada.

他们准备在哪里登陆? 
Where will they land?

那里有深水港口 能停放大型舰队
They have deepwater ports for the ships.

史坦尼斯留下了一座空城 而且那里还是她出生的地方
Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.

而南面之敌…
Enemies to the south...

是艾拉莉亚·沙德还有她养的那群婊子们
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

西面之敌…
Enemies to the west...

是奥莲娜这个老婊子
Olenna, the old cunt.

北面之敌
Enemies to the north.

奈德·史塔克的私生子已经被拥作北境之王 杀了我儿子的那个臭婊子珊莎也与他为伍
Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him.

四面都是敌人 我们被背叛者们团团包围着
Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors.

如今你是兰尼斯特军队的统领
You're in command of the Lannister army now.

你准备如何开始? 可是凛冬已至
How do we proceed? Winter is here.

粮草不济的情况下 我们不可能打赢
We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses.

提利尔家族有粮食 有牲畜
The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.

那么提利尔家族 会跟多斯拉克部落和无垢者为伍吗? 
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?

如果他们笃定丹妮莉丝会赢的话
If they think Daenerys will win.

没人想为败者拼命
No one wants to fight on the losing side.

现在看来 我们没什么胜算
Right now, we look like the losing side.

我可是统领七大王国的女王
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

顶多三个了
Three kingdoms, at best.

我想 你可能并不了解我们现在的处境有多危险
I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.

我知道我们打的是生存之战
I understand we're in a war for survival.

我知道 败者没有活路
I understand whoever loses dies.

我知道胜者就能建立一个王朝 并且会永存于世
I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.

我们的孩子都已经死了
Our children are dead.

我们是兰尼斯特家族最后的成员
We're the last of us.

那就是属于我们的王朝
A dynasty for us, then.

我们还没谈谈托曼
We never talked about Tommen.

没什么好说的
There's nothing to say.

我们的宝贝儿子自我了断了
Our baby boy killed himself.

难道我们要浪费时间为去世的
Should we spend our days mourning the dead...

母亲 父亲 还有我们的孩子们默哀吗? 
Mother, father, and all our children?

瑟曦… 我是爱他们的 真的
Cersei... I loved them. I did.

但现在他们已化为灰烬 而我们还活生生地站在这里
But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood.

我们是兰尼斯特家族最后的成员 最后能算得上的了
We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.

就算是兰尼斯特家族 没有盟军也是活不下去的
Even Lannisters can't survive without allies.

我们的盟军在哪? 
Where are our allies now?

你瞧瞧瓦德·佛雷和他家族发生的一切
You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.

但我们怎能相信那种人? 我们不能
How could we ever trust a man like that? We couldn't.

他就是个没用的懦夫 但佛雷家族拥护我们
He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us.

他们现在全死光了
Now they're all dead.

杀他们的人不会是我们的朋友
Whoever killed them is no friend of ours.

更强的 更厉害的盟友
Stronger, better allies.

我们不可能独胜
We can't win this war alone.

你以为我听命于父亲四十年就没有学到点什么吗? 
You think I listened to father for 40 years and learned nothing?

你邀请葛雷乔伊家族来君临? 
You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?

没有邀请所有 好吧 看起来就像是全部
Not all of them. Well, it looks like all of them.

我邀请的是攸伦·葛雷乔伊 新的铁群岛之王
I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands.

你自己说过我们需要更强更厉害的盟友
You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies.

他们不就是么 他们怎么能算得上是更好的盟友? 
There you are. How are they better allies?

他们和佛雷家族有何不同? 
How are they different from the Freys?

他们都违背了自己的誓言 为了自己的利益背刺了之前的盟友
They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.

时机恰当的话 每个人都会这么做的
So does everyone when it suits them.

和佛雷家族不同的是 他们还有船
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

而且他们擅长杀敌 他们什么都不擅长
And they're good at killing. They're not good at anything.

我知道铁种 都是些个尖酸刻薄的小人
I know the ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people.

自己不建东西不种东西 只知道去偷东西
All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊又不是来偷东西的
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

是嘛 那他为何而来? 
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

从我被选为铁群岛首领的那一刻起 他们就背叛了我
The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me.

他们偷了我最精良的舰队 逃跑了
They stole my best ships and ran.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊
'鸦眼' 铁群岛之王

开着船横穿整个世界 再把舰队献给龙女王 这样她就能渡海 来攻打你
Sailed them right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.

不过 和你所遭遇的背叛相比起来 这不算什么 据我所知是被家族至亲背叛了
It's nothing compared to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family member, from what I hear.

但 这始终困扰着我
But still, it bothers me.

杀了他们会让我好受些
Murdering them would make me feel a lot better.

而且自从背叛我的家族成员站成一派 来对抗我
And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side,

我就认为我们这些合法统治者 应该把他们都杀了
I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.

不过 你并不是合法的统治者 不是吗? 
You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?

为了能自己当上统治者 你们曾经反抗过 不过我记得 你们被彻底击败了
The Greyjoys rebelled against the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated.

说到这里 你不就是那个掀起叛乱的人吗?  你的舰队跑来凯岩城 把兰尼斯特舰队给烧了
Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet?

你引起了我们的注意
You certainly caught us there.

从你们的角度来讲 这个计划非常聪明
Very smart move on your part.

当然了 反正我们都去了铁群岛
Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway.

所以我记忆犹新
I remember very well.

你的传说可多了
I heard so much talk.

盖世无敌 所向披靡
The best in the world. No one can stop him.

说实话 我原先一个字都不信
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

可我不得不承认 当你破浪而来 手起刀落 真是精彩
But I must say when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...  it was glorious.

我杀的可是你的骨肉至亲
The people I was cutting down were your own kin.

铁群岛太挤了
The place was getting crowded.

这对我来说喜闻乐见
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

斩杀葛雷乔伊族人也让我感到乐在其中
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

如果不是你把我们击败 我就不会被流放海外
If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile.

如果我不曾被流放
If I hadn't done that,

我就不会成为十四大洋最有名的舰长
I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.

难道不是最卑微的? 
If not the most humble.

您是女王 统御四方
You're the queen of a great nation.

铁群岛于您 何足挂齿
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

不过是怪石兀立 遍地鸟粪之地
They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and...

全是刁民恶棍
And a lot of very unattractive people.

而铁舰队于您 则有另一重意义
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely.

那可是维斯特洛最庞大的舰队
It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.

有了它 便有了大海
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

您可攻破东面的来犯之敌 亦可粉碎北境南疆的僭越之徒
You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.

那么 你想要什么? 
What do you want in return?

自我年幼时起
Ever since I was a little boy,

便想长大迎娶 世上最美貌的女子
I wanted to grow up and marry the most beautiful woman in the world.

所以 我来了 携带千艘长船 还有两只好手
So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.

我拒绝你的求婚
I decline your proposal.

你不值得信任
You're not trustworthy.

你背弃过盟友 时机一到便将他们斩尽杀绝
You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity.

你谋害兄长
You murdered your own brother.

您不妨一试 那感觉妙不可言
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

我不指望您与我推心置腹
I don't expect you to trust me outright.

您只需要确信我的一片赤诚之心
You need proof of my honest intentions.

以我的经验 要赢得佳人芳心 送礼最为稳妥
In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.

我重返君临城之时 必会为您带来这份无价之礼
I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.

酒鬼的肝 真是屡见不鲜
A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

片刻欢愉就能征服人性
The triumph of transitory pleasures.

博士 我想问…
Archmaester, I was wondering...

我想问 您是否考虑过我的请求
I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.

我不记得你提过请求
I don't remember your proposition.

我曾问您 鉴于我在北境所见 我是否可以获准进入图书馆禁区
I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.

禁区是学士专属
That area is reserved for maesters.

你是学士吗? 不是
Are you a maester? No.

这么看来你的请求不太合理啊
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

博士 请您恕我直言
Archmaester, with respect,

尸鬼大军
The Army of the Dead.

我来到这里 就是为了学会击败他们的方法 然而学城的每一个人 那些愿意听我说的人 他们总是怀疑异鬼是否真实存在
I was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.

学城的每一个人都会质疑万物
Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything.

然而长夜传说并非无中生有
But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication.

许多不相关的文献都有过相似记载
Too many similarities from unconnected sources.

禁区的文献? 
Sources in the restricted area?

最简单的解释就是 对于你念念不忘的异鬼 你说的都是事实 你说你看到了 而你确实真的看到了
And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.

你到底有没有称完那颗心脏? 
You'll finish weighing that heart?

您是孪河城以南唯一相信我的人
That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.

我们可不像孪河城以南的普罗大众
We're not like the people south of the Twins.

也不像孪河城以北的人们
And we're not like the people north of the Twins.

学城的人们为着各自的使命过着不同的生活
In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons.

我们记录这个世界的记忆 山姆威尔·塔利
We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly.

没有我们 人们与家犬何异
Without us, men would be little better than dogs.

脑子里只记得上一顿吃的东西 眼里只看得见身边的事物
Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next.

而我们一旦外出 紧闭房门 他们就哀嚎不已 以为我们再也不回来了
And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever.

当劳勃的叛乱爆发时 人们以为末日来临
When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people thought the end was near.

坦格利安王朝的末日来了 '我们该如何存活? '
The end of the Targaryen dynasty. 'How will we survive?'

当伊耿·坦格利安向西虎视眈眈 策龙踏平黑水河
When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush...

而在数千年以前 长夜降临之时 他们认为那时便是末日 也是一个道理
And thousands of years before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end.

然而一切未曾终结 那些时刻都不曾是末日
But it wasn't. None of it was.

绝境长城 岿然不动
The Wall has stood through it all.

而每个冬天 都会过去
And every winter that ever came has ended.

好孩子 把这收拾干净了
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

我听说她单挑打赢了猎狗
I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat.

培提尔·贝里席
'小指头' 峡谷守护者

这女人真是让人印象深刻
She's a very impressive woman.

你想要什么 贝里席大人
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

我想要你开心
I want you to be happy.

我想要你安全
I want you to be safe.

我在家 和朋友们在一起
I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

布蕾妮保护我不受任何人伤害
I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.

你为什么不开心
Why aren't you happy?

你想要什么你现在没有的东西? 
What do you want that you do not have?

现在 我只想要静一静
At the moment, peace and quiet.

不用再说了贝里席大人
No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish.

我就假装你要说的这句话很聪明
I'll assume it was something clever.

为什么他还在这儿
Why is he still here?

没有谷地 拉姆斯·波顿还会占据着临冬城
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle.

小指头救了我们
Littlefinger saved us.

我很清楚他想要什么
I know exactly what he wants.

这歌很好听
That's a pretty song.

我以前从没听过
I've never heard it before.

饿吗? 我们有兔肉
Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

我不想偷你们的食物
I don't want to steal your food.

你不是偷 我们主动给你
You're not stealing, we're offering.

来吧 今晚会很冷的
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

看你口味了 我觉得
Depends on your taste, I guess.

如果你喜欢街上到处是屎和猪血 那你就去对地方了
If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

我这辈子一直都想看红堡 贝勒大教堂 龙穴
All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit.

当我终于到了 他们却把我拦在红堡一里之外 贝勒大教堂已经被炸毁了 龙穴则成了废墟
Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

住那儿的人 他们会活剥了你 说不定还能卖两个铜板
The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide.

全世界最烂的地方
Worst place in the world.

你们在河间地干什么? 
What are you doing in the Riverlands?

孪河城的佛雷家遇到了些麻烦 我们是过来维护治安的
There's been some trouble with the Freys up at the Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace.

你来吧 客人优先
Here you go. Guests first.

不 我不能吃 否则你们就不够吃了
Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.

我妈总告诉我对陌生人要友好
My mother always told me to be kind to strangers.

陌生人也会对你友好
Strangers will be kind to you.

你们离家这么远
You're a long way from home.

我猜你们的经历肯定都很刺激
I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.

是 多到数不过来
Yeah, endless adventures.

他们会在歌谣里传唱我们一千年
They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

事实上我们离家时 迫不及待远走高飞
The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away.

但现在我们离开了一段时间 又渴望回家
But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home.

我就想起我爸一个人乘船出去
I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone.

我就应该和他在一起
I ought to be out there with him.

我妻子刚生下我们第一个孩子
My wife just had our first baby.

男孩还是女孩? 啊 谁知道啊
Boy or girl?Oh, who knows?

你以为士兵能收到家里的渡鸦来信吗? 
You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?

我希望是女孩为什么? 
I hope it's a girl.Why?

爹要是老了 女孩可以照顾爹
Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old.

男孩只能上战场 为别人作战
Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.

你这岁数 能喝酒吗? 
Are you old enough to drink?

这是黑莓酒
It's blackberry wine.

所以 为什么这么个漂亮姑娘要自己去君临? 
So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?

我要去杀女王
I'm going to kill the queen.

今晚不该出门啊
Bad night to be outdoors.

能察觉到这点你的法力还真是强大
You've got real powerful magic to figure that out.

光之王和你说悄悄话了吗? 
Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear?

'外面下雪了 索罗斯 起风了
'It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy.

今晚会很冷'
It's gonna be a cold night.'

你真是头坏脾气的熊啊 是不是 克里冈? 
You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane?

不爱喝那垃圾玩意儿 太甜
Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

你怎么总这么阴沉? 
Why are you always in such a foul mood?

这儿看起来像是个过夜的好去处
This seems like a good place to spend the night.

那里的人不想让我们待在这里
These people don't want us here.

我看这里已经废弃了 没有牲畜
Seems deserted to me. No livestock.

烟囱里不冒烟
No smoke coming from the chimney.

我不喜欢这里的样子
I don't like the look of it.

你块头这么大 胆子倒是挺小
For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

我来告诉你什么吓不住我
I'll tell you what doesn't scare me...

你这种秃头混蛋
Bald cocksuckers like you.

你以为你头上梳个髻就能唬住别人了吗? 
You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot?

也许他们藏了些麦酒
Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

看看有没有储藏室
See if there's a larder.

他们总会留点什么
They always leave something behind.

你觉得他们遭遇了什么? 
How do you think it ended for them?

女儿死在了父亲的怀里
Girl died in her father's arms.

他们浑身是血 脚下还有一把刀
Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet.

我觉着眼见着快要饿死
I'd say they were starving.

父亲不愿让女儿受苦 便了结了两人的生命
And rather than let his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them.

是啊 无所谓了
No, doesn't matter now.

我认识你很久了 唐德利恩
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

我记得第一次遇见你是在那次比武大会…
I think the first time we met was at that tournament...

我一直以为你是个榆木脑袋
And I always thought you were dull as dirt.

我不喜欢你 不过你也不赖
Don't like you,but you're not bad.

这些话很暖心
That warms the heart.

但是你没什么特别之处
But there's nothing special about you.

这话倒不假
You're right about that.

那为什么光之王一直让你复活? 
So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back?

我见过比你更好的人 他们被吊死在横梁上 或者被斩首 或者就是暴尸荒野
I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere.

他们中没一个还能复活
None of them came back.

你觉得我不会扪心自问吗? 
You think I don't ask myself that?

每时每刻? 
Every hour of every day?

我应该做什么? 
What am I supposed to do?

主看中了我的什么? 
What does the Lord see in me?

我不理解我们的主
I don't understand our Lord.

我不知道他想从我这里得到什么
I don't know what he wants from me.

我只知道他想让我活下去
I only know that he wants me alive.

如果他这么全能 为什么他不直接告诉你他想要什么? 
If he's so allpowerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?

别担心 火又不会咬人
Don't worry.The fire won't bite.

我想给你看些东西
I want to show you something.

我跟一群拜火者搭伙真是他妈的走运
It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.

几乎可以说是天降正义
Almost seems like divine justice.

哪里有什么天降正义 你个蠢蛋
There's no divine justice,you dumb cunt.

有的话 你早死了… 而那个女孩会活下来
If there was, you'd be dead...  and that girl would be alive.

你想干什么?  瞧这火焰
What do you want? Look into the flames.

我不想看这傻逼火焰
I don't want to look in the damn flames.

你曾把他砍到 之后亲眼见到我把他起死回生
You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down.

你不想知道我的法力是怎么来的吗? 
Don't you want to know what gave me the power?

我一直在问 可没人愿意告诉我
I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.

只有火焰能告诉你
Only the fire can tell you.

绝境长城与海交汇的地方
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

有一座城堡
There's a castle there.

看起来像个箭头
Looks like an arrowhead.

死人大军正在行军通过
The dead are marching past.

克里冈 你现在相信我了吗? 
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

你相信我们不是随随便便就跑到这里来了吧? 
Do you believe we're here for a reason?

克里冈 你这是干什么呢? 
What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

认识? 
You knew these people.

我们祈求天父仁慈的审判
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy.

我们祈求圣母…
We ask the Mother to...

操 后面我忘了
Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.

我很遗憾你们死了
I'm sorry you're dead.

山姆 你真的该睡觉了
You should really sleep, Sam.

坦格利安家族用龙晶来装饰他们的武器 却不知道先民用它来干什么
The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.

这是龙石岛的地图
It's a map of Dragonstone.

坦格利安家族入侵维斯特洛时 在这里建造了他们的第一个要塞
The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.

史坦尼斯告诉过我 可我没想到…
Stannis told me,but I didn't think...

这很重要 琼恩得知道这个消息
This is important.Jon needs to know.

还没听到消息
Haven't heard anything.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 龙之母

在这样的夜晚您降临于世
On a night like this, you came into the world.

我记得那场风暴
I remember that storm.

君临城所有的狗 都叫了一整夜
All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.

我要是也能记得就好了
I wish I could remember it.

我之前总是认为这会是回家
I always thought this would be a homecoming.

但这里没有家的感觉
Doesn't feel like home.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生' 海外的女王

提利昂·兰尼斯特
女王之手

我们不会在龙石岛待太久
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

七大王国里 瑟曦控制的不到一半
Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms.

维斯特洛的领主们都讨厌她
The lords of Westeros despise her.

瓦里斯
'八爪蜘蛛'

甚至在您登陆前 他们还在密谋推翻她
Even before your arrival, they plotted against her.

而现在… 他们为自己真正的女王呐喊助威? 
Now... They cry out for their true queen?

偷偷举杯向我致敬? 
They drink secret toasts to my health?

人们曾经给我哥讲过这些事 而他蠢到连这都信
People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.

如果韦赛里斯有三头巨龙 一支大军 他早就入侵君临了
If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.

征服维斯特洛对您来说易如反掌
Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.

但您在这里目的可不是要成为灰烬女王
But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.

拿下七大王国 不非得涂炭生灵
We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse.

如果各大家族拥护您来共同讨伐瑟曦 这场游戏必赢
If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won.

提利尔与多恩大军站到了我们这边 我们在南境拥有最强大盟友
With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.

我还没有向你正式道谢
I never properly thanked you for that.

陛下 他们之所以加入了我们一方 是因为他们完全信赖您
They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.

瓦里斯大人 你侍奉过我的父亲 对吗? 
You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?

之后你侍奉了那个推翻了他的人
And then you served the man who overthrew him.

我确实有选择的机会 陛下 侍奉劳勃·拜拉席恩 或被斧头砍掉脑袋
I had a choice, Your Grace serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.

但你侍奉了他没多长时间
But you didn't serve him long.

又转而反抗他
You turned against him.

不可否认 劳勃比您父亲更为开明
Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure.

历史上罕有像疯王这样 残暴的统治者
There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King.

劳勃既不疯狂也不残暴
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

他只是对当国王没什么兴趣
He simply had no interest in being king.

所以你自告奋勇去找一个更好的
So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.

陛下 当我打算沉溺饮酒终了此生的时候
Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin,

瓦里斯大人告诉我东方有一位女王…
Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who

在我掌权之前 你还支持过我的哥哥
Before I came to power, you favored my brother.

你那些间谍 那些小小鸟 他们告诉过你韦赛里斯是个残忍愚蠢的废物吗? 
All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?

依你所见 这些是成为一名好国王的品质吗? 
Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?

陛下 直到您和卓戈卡奥联姻之前
Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

我对您一无所知 我不知道您的存在 还有您传说中的美貌
I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.

所以你和你的朋友们就像卖牲口一样把我卖给了多斯拉克人
So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

这也成了您日后的制胜筹码
Which you turned to your advantage.

谁给你下令要杀我? 
Who gave the order to kill me?

谁雇佣了刺客? 
Who hired the assassins?

谁将指示送到厄索斯意图谋杀丹妮莉丝·坦格利安? 
Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

陛下 我已采取了必要措施以 以保住你的小命? 
Your Grace, I did what had to be done toTo keep yourself alive.

瓦里斯大人已经证明了自己是一名忠诚的仆人
Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.

证明了忠诚? 恰恰相反
Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite.

如果他厌恶了一位君主 他就会密谋拥护下一位
If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one.

这算什么仆人? 
What kind of a servant is that?

国家需要的那种仆人
The kind the realm needs.

无能的君主不值得盲目追随
Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.

只要我还能分辨得出 我就会继续寻找明君
As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.

我没有生在权贵家族
I wasn't born into a great house.

我被当作奴隶来贩卖 男根被切下来作为祭品
I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.

我还是个孩子的时候 我在小巷 贫民窟和废屋里苟且求生
When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

您想知道我的忠诚在哪里? 
You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?

我的忠诚不属于任何国王或者女王 我的忠诚属于人民
Not with any king or queen, but with the people.

那些在暴政酷压或是清政繁荣下挣扎的人民
The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.

那些衷心祈愿您获胜的人民
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

如果您只要盲目的忠诚
If you demand blind allegiance,

我尊重您的意愿
I respect your wishes.

灰虫子可以将我斩首 您的巨龙可以将我生吞
Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.

但您若放我一命 我将鞠躬尽瘁
But if you let me live, I will serve you well.

我将竭心尽力直到亲眼见到您登临铁王座 因为我选择了您
I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you.

因为我知道除您以外人民别无选择
Because I know the people have no better chance than you.

向我宣誓效忠 瓦里斯
Swear this to me, Varys.

如果你认为我辜负了人民 你不会密谋造反
If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back.

而是像今天这样直视我 告诉我是如何辜负了人民的
You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

我发誓 女王陛下
I swear it, my queen.

我也发誓如果你背叛我
And I swear thisif you ever betray me,

我对龙之母别无他求
I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.

启禀陛下
Forgive me, my queen.

一位来自亚夏的红袍女祭司求见
A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.

她曾经侍奉过另一位想夺取铁王座的人
She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的下场可不太好啊
It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

你选了个好日子来龙石岛
You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.

我们刚刚原谅了那些 侍奉昏君的人
We've just decided to pardon those who once served the wrong king.

光之王在维斯特洛没有多少追随者吧? 
The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?

暂时是这样 但即使是那些不崇拜光之王的人 也能为他的大业效力
Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.

你的光之王想从我这里得到些什么呢? 
What does your lord expect from me?

恐怕我并不是一位王子
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

陛下 请原谅 您的理解不够准确
Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.

在高等瓦雷利亚语中这个名词不带阴阳性 所以这段预言的正确翻译应该是
That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,

说起来不怎么顺口啊
Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?

确实 但我更喜欢这样
No, but I like it better.

你相信这段预言指的是我? 
And you believe this prophecy refers to me?

预言是危险的东西
Prophecies are dangerous things.

我相信的是您有自己的使命
I believe you have a role to play.

另一位也是一样 北境之王 琼恩·雪诺
As does another the King in the North, Jon Snow.

奈德·史塔克的私生子?  你认识他? 
Ned Stark's bastard? You know him?

他加入守夜人的时候我和他一起去的长城
I travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.

你觉得光之王为什么会选中这个琼恩·雪诺呢? 
And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?

我是说 除了你在火焰里看见的那些幻象以外
Aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is.

作为守夜人的总司令 他让野人进入了长城以南 保护他们免受灭顶之灾
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from grave danger.

作为北境之王 他把野人和北境的各大家族联合起来 这样他们能够一起面对共同的敌人
As King in the North, he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses, so together they may face their common enemy.

听起来很了不起嘛
He sounds like quite a man.

让他站在您的面前 让他告诉您发生在他身上的一切 他亲眼所见的种种事情
Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.

对于预言和火焰中的幻像 我没什么看法 但我喜欢琼恩·雪诺 我相信他
I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

我看人很准
And I am an excellent judge of character.

如果他确实控制了北境 那他将成为我们有力的盟友
If he does rule the North, he would make a valuable ally.

兰尼斯特家族处决了他的父亲 并且谋害了他的兄长
The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.

琼恩·雪诺甚至比你更有理由痛恨瑟曦
Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.

告诉琼恩·雪诺 他的女王 邀请他前往龙石岛… 并臣服于她
Tell Jon Snow that his queen invites him to come to Dragonstone...  and bend the knee.

集合 都到这里来
Gather round. Come here.

你真觉得是提利昂送来的信? 
You think it's really Tyrion?

说不定是别人设的陷阱
It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.

这是我们第一次见面时他对我说的话
It's something he said to me the first night we met.

你比我们其他人都更了解他
You know him better than any of us.

琼恩·雪诺
北境之王

提利昂跟其他兰尼斯特家的人不一样
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

他对我一直很好 但是这太冒险了
He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.

'只要瑟曦还坐在铁王座上 七大王国就会继续血流成河
'The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.

只要同心协力 我们就能终结她的暴政'
Together, we can end her tyranny.'

戴佛斯·席渥斯
'洋葱骑士'

听起来还挺有吸引力的
Sounds like a charmer.

当然 他顺便提到了多斯拉克部族 一支无垢者军团 还有三条龙 这就不怎么吸引人了
Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons a bit less charming.

您告诉过我 火焰能杀死尸鬼
Fire kills wights, you told me.

你该不会真想让琼恩和她会面吧? 
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

不 那样太危险了 但是? 
No, too dangerous. But?

但是如果亡者大军越过了长城 我们有足够的士兵抵挡他们吗? 
But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?

如果疯王的女儿得到了铁王座 我们都清楚 她将会毁灭全境
If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

你们之中有些人是提利尔家族的封臣
Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
铁王座上的女王

但提利尔家族已经公开造反
But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.

靠着他们的帮助 疯王的女儿 已经往我们的境内运了一支野蛮人军团 无垢者就是些战争机器 会摧毁你们的城堡和要塞
With their help, the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

而多斯拉克蛮族会把你们的村庄夷为平地 强暴奴役你们的女人 毫不犹豫地屠杀你们的孩子
Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.

这就是奥莲娜·提利尔对于你们几百年来的效忠所作出的回报
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.

你们一定都还记得疯王
You all remember the Mad King.

你们一定都还记得他给人民带来的恐怖
You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 御林铁卫队长

他的女儿也会和他一样
His daughter is no different.

在厄斯索斯 她的暴行妇孺皆知
In Essos, her brutality is already legendary.

她把奴隶湾的数百名贵族都钉上了十字架
She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

当她玩腻了这些把戏 就拿他们去喂龙
And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.

保护子民是我神圣的义务 而我也一定会做到
It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will.

但是各位 我需要你们的帮助
But I need your help, my lords.

我们所有人必须团结一致… 才能阻止她
We must stand together, all of us...  if we hope to stop her.

蓝道·塔利
角陵伯爵

陛下 她有三条成年巨龙啊
She has three fullgrown dragons, Your Grace.

跟伊耿当年征服七国时 一模一样
The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.

您要怎么抵挡它们呢? 
How do you propose to stop them?

科本
被剥夺项链的学士

大人 我们正在研究对策
We are currently at work on a solution, my lord.

您一定认识我的儿子吧
I believe you know my son.

感谢您的到来
Thank you for coming.

河湾地的其他领主都比以前更指望着您的领导呢
The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever.

您要不来 说不定他们都不会来了
They might not have come if you hadn't.

只要女王召见我 我一定会响应
If my queen summons me, I answer the call.

而且我也听说了她是怎么对待那些反对者的
And I've heard what she does to those who defy her.

您今天要回角陵? 
You ride for Horn Hill today?

我得调遣军队
I have an army to mobilize.

战争要来了
Won't be long before the fighting starts.

那么您会为哪一方作战呢? 
And which side will you be fighting for?

您是唯一曾在战场上打败过劳勃·拜拉席恩的人
You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.

就连雷加·坦格利安也没能做到这一点
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could do that.

回到河湾地可是很长一段路 詹姆爵士 您需要我做什么? 
It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

我希望您能在即将到来的战争中担任我的高级将领
I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.

我希望您向瑟曦宣誓效忠 我还希望您能帮助我打败她的敌人
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.

包括奥莲娜·提利尔
Including Olenna Tyrell.

这个名字是有份量的
That name means something.

我们既不是破誓者 也不是阴谋家
We're not oathbreakers. We're not schemers.

我们不会在对手背后捅刀子 更不会在婚礼上将人割喉
We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.

我向提利尔家族盟过誓
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

你也对王室宣过誓 塔利大人
You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly.

我很小就认识奥莲娜了
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

她曾是个卓越的女人
She was a great woman once.

她只是迫切想要复仇 甚至把多斯拉克人带上了岸
She wants revenge so badly, she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

这可是维斯特洛史上第一次出现多斯拉克人啊
The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.

我知道你不喜欢我姐姐 但是你必须做出选择
I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.

是跟我们并肩作战 还是跟外邦蛮族和阉人并肩作战? 
Do you fight with us or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

战争胜利之后 女王会需要一个新的南境守护
When the war is won, the queen will need a new Warden of the South.

我想不起任何比蓝道·塔利 更适合的人选
I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarly.

山姆威尔·塔利
学城学徒

感染扩散的面积太大了
The infection has spread too far.

你应该在被碰到的那一刻就砍断自己的胳膊
You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.

安布罗斯
学城博士

这病杀死你得花上好些年
It'll be years before it kills you.

还有多久会…
But how long until...?

六个月 可能更快
Six months, maybe fewer.

我在黑城堡见过史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的女儿
I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.

她在婴儿时期患上了灰麟病且被治愈了
She had the greyscale as a baby and was cured.

不 是不是有什么办法
No. Isn't there some way

你看他像个婴儿吗? 
Does this look like a baby to you?

不像 那你研究过 灰鳞病的恶化速率 在孩童和成人身上的差异吗? 
No. Have you studied the varying rates of greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?

克礼森学士及时发现了
Maester Cressen discovered

席琳·拜拉席恩的病
Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.

而他已病入膏肓
This is quite advanced.

恕我们无能为力 爵士
And beyond our skills, ser.

若你只是个平民 我会立马将你遣送至瓦雷利亚 与石民共度余生
Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men.

但你是个受封的骑士 我会多宽限你一天
As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.

如何度过这点时间取决于你
How you choose to spend that time is up to you.

需要我们给您的家人传话吗 爵士? 
Should we send word to your family, Ser...?

对他们来说我都死了好多年了
I've been dead to them for years.

陛下 您下来过这里吗? 
Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?

没有 该是没来过
No, I can't say I have.

自从劳勃把这些东西从王座厅移出来我就再没见过了
I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the throne room.

很奇怪劳勃国王竟没有销毁它们
Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.

这些都是他的战利品
They were his trophies.

他不能摆在自己周围
He couldn't keep them around.

它们会让他显得渺小
They would have made him look small.

他有时会下来瞧瞧它们
Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.

我敢说他偶尔也把他的婊子带过来
I believe he brought his whores on occasion.

伊耿骑着这只野兽飞过大海
The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.

他的火焰锻造了铁王座 使七王国俯首帖耳
His flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

十分强大… 但却不是坚不可摧
Powerful...  but not invincible.

实际上 丹妮莉丝的一头龙 在弥林的竞技场上被长矛刺伤了
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.

如果他们能被刺伤 他们也能被杀掉
And if they can be wounded, they can be killed.

这是君临城里最好的制弩师傅和铁匠 夜以继日赶工出来的 女王陛下
The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.

您可以试着拉下那个操纵杆
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

如果你想要铁王座 就去拿吧
If you want the Iron Throne, take it.

我们有一支军队 一支舰队 还有三头龙
We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.

我们现在就应该动用全部兵力全力攻打君临城
We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.

君临城会在一天之内沦陷
The city will fall within a day.

如果把龙放了 成千上万的人将死于火焰之中
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

艾拉莉亚·沙德
'红毒蛇'的情妇

你没有这个胃口 就赶紧跑回去躲起来
You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.

我知道你们是怎么发动战争的
I know how you wage war.

在这里我们不会毒害小女孩
We don't poison little girls here.

弥塞菈是无辜的
Myrcella was innocent.

兰尼斯特家族没有无辜的人
There are no innocent Lannisters.

我最后悔的事情就是让奥柏伦为你战死
My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.

提利昂大人是女王之手
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

请你对他放尊重点
You will treat him with respect.

我来这里不是为了做'灰烬'女王的
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

说得真好听
That's very nice to hear.

奥莲娜夫人
'荆棘女王'

当然了 我记不起有哪个女王 比我的孙女更受爱戴
Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my granddaughter.

百姓们爱戴她
The common people loved her.

贵族们也爱戴她
The nobles loved her.

可现在她剩下了什么呢? 
And what is left of her now?

百姓也好 贵族也好 他们真的就只是孩子而已
Commoners, nobles, they're all just children, really.

除非他们怕你 否则就不会服从你
They won't obey you unless they fear you.

我很感激您的谏言 奥莲娜夫人
I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.

我很感激在场的所有人
I'm grateful to all of you.

但是你们已经选择了追随我
But you have chosen to follow me.

我不会进攻君临城
I will not attack King's Landing.

我们不会进攻君临城
We will not attack King's Landing.

那你打算怎样夺回铁王座? 
Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?

我们将包围君临城 从各个方向围住
We will lay siege to the capital, surrounding the city on all sides.

瑟曦拥有铁王座 但她的军队和人民都没有粮食供给
Cersei will have the Iron Throne, but no food for her army or the people.

我们不会派多斯拉克人和无垢者
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

瑟曦将会利用他们的忠诚 他们的爱国之心 尝试与维斯特洛的诸侯结盟
Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.

如果我们用外族战士包围都城 就正中她的下怀了
If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.

我们的军队必须是维斯特洛人
Our army should be Westerosi.

我猜 维斯特洛人就是指我们咯? 
And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?

葛雷乔伊女士将护送你回到阳戟城
Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.

她的铁舰队将运送多恩军队 从背后袭击君临
And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.

多恩军队将和提利尔军队一起围攻君临
The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.

两大王国联手对抗瑟曦
Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.

所以 你的宏伟计划就是派我们的军队前去进攻
So, your master plan is to use our armies.

恕我直言 为什么不派你们的人上? 
Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?

无垢者另有任务
The Unsullied will have another objective.

几十年来 维斯特洛的实权被兰尼斯特家族掌握
For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.

而他们的权力中心是凯岩城
And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.

灰虫子和无垢者 将从海路进攻凯岩城 一举夺下
Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.

你们赞同我的计划吗? 
Do I have your support?

多恩愿与您联手 陛下
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

奥莲娜夫人 我们可以单独聊一下吗
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

我明白您是出于对瑟曦的仇恨才愿与我联手 您并不喜欢我
I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.

但我对您发誓 她必将为她所做之事付出代价
But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.

维斯特洛将重归和平
And we will bring peace back to Westeros.

您认为您父亲曾为我们带来和平? 
Do you think that's what we had under your father?

或者您的祖父? 曾祖父? 
Or his father? Or his?

和平总是转瞬即逝 亲爱的
Peace never lasts, my dear.

您愿意听取一位老妇人的一点建议吗? 
Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?

您的国王之手 他是有智慧的人
He's a clever man, your Hand.

我见识过许多聪明人
I've known a great many clever men.

他们都没我活得久
I've outlived them all.

维斯特洛的领主都是绵羊
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

不打算跟我告个别吗? 
Were you going to say goodbye?

等我回来 我们就会再见面
I will see you when I return.

但谁知道那会是什么时候
But you don't know when that will be.

愿你好运
I wish you good fortune.

我不知该如何跟你告别
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

你… 你是我的软肋
Yyou are my weakness.

在无垢者年幼的时候 伟主们便会了解他们的软肋
When Unsullied are young, the masters learn their fears.

有的怕狗 有的恐高 有的畏惧海洋
One boy is scared of dogs, one boy hates high places, one is frightened of the ocean.

伟主就让他们和狗一起睡 爬悬崖
They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.

扔水里
They throw him in the water.

如果他学会了游泳 很好
If he learns to swim, good.

无论怎样 无垢者的队伍都会变得更强大
Either way, strong Unsullied.

我不是最高的 也不是最壮的 但我一直都是最无所畏惧的
I was never the biggest, never the strongest...  but I was bravest, always.

我相信这一点 直到…
I believe it. Until...

直到我在千面屿遇见了弥桑黛
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

奇维亚桑是个糟糕的作家 但他搞研究很有一套
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer, but an excellent researcher.

博士, 请问我能不能…  还有这本
Archmaester, I wondered if IAnd this one.

法乌尔学士就完全不一样了… 他文采出众 讲的东西有一半都是自己编的
Maester Faull was quite the opposite a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.

呃 请问…
Um, I wanted to ask you

塔利 如果你想写史书的话 一定要做研究
If you're going to write histories, Tarly, you have to do the research.

受欢迎的史书 得有点自己的风格
If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.

《劳勃一世国王驾崩后战争编年史》不是我写的 所以它在书架上无人问津
I'm not writing 'A Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I' so it can sit on a shelf unread.

怎么? 你不喜欢这个书名? 
What? You don't like the title?

换做你会怎么起? 
What would you call it, then?

嗯 或许更有诗意点? 
Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?

我们可不是诗人 塔利
We're not poets, Tarly.

呃 博士 我可以说两句吗
Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.

我似乎找到了治疗乔拉爵士的方法
I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.

之前曾有过两则灰鳞病晚期被治愈的病例
There are two recorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured.

我在派洛斯博士的《罕见疾病研究》里面找到了疗法
I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by Archmaester Pylos.

我知道派洛斯博士 还有他的《罕见疾病研究》
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and his study of rare diseases.

你想知道他怎么死的吗
And shall I tell you how he died?

哦 治疗方法太危险了 所以那种疗法现在被禁止了
Oh. The procedure's far too dangerous, which is why it's now forbidden.

你是乔拉·莫尔蒙 杰奥·莫尔蒙的独子
You're Jorah Mormont, the only son of Jeor Mormont.

我是山姆威尔·塔利
My name is Samwell Tarly,

守夜人的弟兄 在此受训 准备担任黑城堡的学士
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch, training to serve as maester at Castle Black.

他去世时我在他身边
I was with him when he died.

你死期未到 乔拉爵士
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

请全都喝掉 可能会很疼
Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

请脱掉上衣
If you could take off your shirt.

如果您不介意的话 麻烦咬紧牙关
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

不好意思 因为没有人知道我在这儿 如果有人听见你大喊大叫 我们都得完蛋
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here, and if they hear you screaming, then we're both finished.

你之前做过这种手术吗? 
Have you ever done this before?

不过也没人敢做 所以您只能指望我了
But no one else will try it, so I'm the best you've got.

我会把附着在皮肤表面的感染组织都切除 然后把药膏敷在…
I'm going to have to remove the entire upper layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the...

再说一次 抱歉 但拜托您尽量别叫
Again, I'm sorry, but please try not to scream.

听说她的龙比伊耿的还大
They say her dragons are bigger than Aegon's.

瞎扯 瑟曦不过想吓唬人罢了
Horseshit. Cersei's just trying to frighten us.

她要是围攻君临城 价格能翻三倍
If she lays siege to King's Landing, prices will triple.

只要咱们能在开战前赶到那儿
As long as we get back there before they start.

再来一杯 我们可要长途跋涉了
One more round. It's a long ride.

秘诀是揉面团之前就把黄油煮成焦黄的
The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.

一般人都不这么弄 因为太花功夫了
Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.

嗯 我从来不这么弄
Mm, I didn't do that.

你也烤过派? 
You've been making pies?

我真不敢相信你会在这
I can't believe you're here.

你碰到过那个大块头女士了吗? 
Did you meet the big lady?

大块头? 是个女骑士
Big lady? The lady knight?

那个 我觉得她是个骑士因为她穿着盔甲
You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.

她在找你姐姐 不过我跟她提到了你
She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.

她后来找到你了吗? 
Did she ever find you?

你出什么事了 阿利? 
What happened to you, Arry?

你现在往哪去?  君临城
Where you heading? King's Landing.

去干嘛?  听说瑟曦当女王了
Why? Heard Cersei's queen now.

听说她炸了大圣堂
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

那场景肯定很壮观
That must have been something to see.

我真想不到有人会做出这种事
I can't believe someone would do that.

瑟曦就干得出来
Cersei would do that.

我还以为你要去临冬城
I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

去那儿干嘛? 那已经是波顿家的了
Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.

没有 波顿家的人都死了
No, the Boltons are dead.

琼恩·雪诺率领野人军队从黑城堡南下 他赢了私生子之战
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.

现在是北境之王了
He's King of the North now.

为什么我会说谎? 
Why would I lie about that?

他是你哥哥 对吧? 
He's your brother, right?

真不敢相信 我以前还以为你是个男孩
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

照顾好自己 热派
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

尽量保命
Try not to get killed.

离君临城还有两百里
200 miles to King's Landing.

一壶朗姆酒 你觉得够喝吗? 
One bottle of rum. You think we'll make it?

陛下 从学城来的渡鸦
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

这是山姆威尔·塔利寄给我的信
This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly.

做守夜人时 他与我情同手足 世上我最为信赖之人
He was my brother at the Night's Watch, a man I trust as much as anyone in this world.

他已找到证据证明 龙石岛耸立的山岩上遍布龙晶
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

我还于数天前收到了 龙石岛的来信
I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.

是提利昂·兰尼斯特寄给我的
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

他现任丹妮莉丝·坦格利安女王的御前首相
He is now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.

她意图从瑟曦·手中夺回铁王座
She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.

培提尔·贝里席
'小指头'

她强兵在握 此外 如果这封信内容属实 她还有三条巨龙
She has a powerful army at her back and, if this message is to be believed, three dragons.

提利昂大人邀我前往龙石岛 与丹妮莉丝会面
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys.

我已同意
And I'm going to accept.

领主们 我们需要这些龙晶!
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

我们都明白唯有龙晶 能杀死异鬼和他们的大军
We know that dragonglass can destroy both white walkers and their army.

我们应开采龙晶并制成武器
We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.

但更重要的一点 我们需要盟友!
But more importantly, we need allies!

夜王的军队日益壮大
The Night King's army grows larger by the day.

仅凭自己我们恐难战胜
We can't defeat them on our own.

我们寡不敌众
We don't have the numbers.

丹妮莉丝拥有庞大军队 和龙焰
Daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire.

我将竭力说服她与我们并肩作战
I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.

戴佛斯爵士与我将明日启程 赶往白港 然后渡去龙石岛
Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.

你难道忘了我们祖父的遭遇? 
Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?

疯王邀他去君临城 然后活生生将他烧死 我知道
The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive. I know that.

她来此是要夺回铁王座与七大王国
She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

北境也是七大王国之一
The North is one of those seven kingdoms.

这不是个邀请 这是个陷阱
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

确有这种可能 但我不信提利昂会做这种事
It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.

你了解他 他是个好人
You know him. He's a good man.

陛下 恕我冒昧 我同意珊莎小姐
Your Grace, with respect, I must agree with Lady Sansa.

疯王的暴行我仍记忆犹新
I remember the Mad King all too well.

约恩·罗伊斯
'青铜'

坦格利安家族不能信任
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

兰尼斯特家的人也一样 对!
Nor can a Lannister. Yeah!

对 我们向您的兄长称臣
Aye. We called your brother king.

然后他挥兵南下 痛失国土
And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.

罗贝特·葛洛佛
深林堡伯爵

凛冬已至 陛下
Winter is here, Your Grace.

我们需要北境之王镇守北境
We need the King in the North in the North.

莱安娜·莫尔蒙
熊岛伯爵夫人

你们拥我为王
You all crowned me your king.

我也从未要求过称王
I never asked for it.

但我接受了 因为北境是我的故土
But I accepted it because the North is my home.

它是我的一部分 我会一直为它战斗 不论机会多渺茫
It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.

但是情况于我们很不利
But the odds are against us.

你们没人见过异鬼的军队 没有一个人见过
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you.

我们绝不可能寄希望于孤军奋战
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

我们需要同盟 强大的同盟
We need allies, powerful allies.

但是我不得不冒这个险
But I have to take it.

那就派个使者 不要自己去
Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.

只有北境之王才能说服她来帮我们
Only a king can convince her to help us.

你这是弃你的臣民于不顾
You're abandoning your people!

弃你的家于不顾
You're abandoning your home.

我会把他们交给值得信赖的人
I'm leaving both in good hands.

你是临冬城唯一的史塔克
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

在我回来之前 北境是你的
Until I return, the North is yours.

我亲自把他的遗骨送回来
I delivered his bones myself.

呈给凯瑟琳夫人 替提利昂·兰尼斯特示好
Presented them to Lady Catelyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.

真是恍如隔世
Seems like a lifetime ago.

等见到提利昂大人的时候 请一定代我向他问好
Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.

他死时我很难过
I was sorry when he died.

你父亲和我有矛盾 但是他很爱凯特
Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.

她不喜欢你 对吧
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

唉 看起来她真是大大低估了你
Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.

你的父亲和兄弟都死了 然而你还在 成了北境之王
Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand, King in the North.

是暴雨袭来时的最大希望
Last best hope against the coming storm.

你不属于这里
You don't belong down here.

我们从来没有好好地说过话
We haven't ever talked... properly.

我想弥补
I wanted to remedy that.

我跟你无话可说
I have nothing to say to you.

连一句'谢谢'也不说吗
Not even 'thank you'?

要不是我 你早就命丧战场了
If it weren't for me, you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield.

你有许多敌人 陛下 但是我向你起誓 我不是
You have many enemies, my king, but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.

我爱珊莎 正如我爱她母亲一样
I love Sansa, as I loved her mother.

敢碰我妹妹 我亲手弄死你
Touch my sister, and I'll kill you myself.

娜梅莉亚 是我 艾莉亚
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

我在往北去 姑娘
I'm heading north, girl.

回临冬城 我终于要回家了
Back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home.

你不能独占他们所有人 这不公平
You can't have them all. It's not fair.

妈妈会想要瑟曦
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

魔山杀了父亲
The Mountain killed Father.

他一只手就能碾碎你
He'll crush you with one hand.

是父亲太大意了 妈妈就是这么说的
Father got careless. That's what Mama says.

你能别一口一个妈妈了吗? 
Will you shut up about Mama?

说不定我在到君临城之前就把你俩都杀了
Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.

这样我就不用和人分享了
And then I won't have to share.

这马尿也能喝? 
How can you drink this piss?

等到了阳戟城
When we reach Sunspear,

我请你喝多恩红
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

全世界最美的酒
The best in the world.

你去过多恩吗
Have you ever been to Dorne?

能给我们再来点酒吗? 
Could we get some more?

我以为你不喜欢喝
I thought it wasn't for you.

我开始尝出味儿来了
I'm developing a taste for it.

他不是你的仆人 没关系
He's not your servant. It's fine.

所以 你会是铁群岛的女王了
So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.

只要我杀了我叔叔
Once I kill my uncle.

那你呢 帅哥
And what will you be, handsome?

我听命于女王
Whatever my queen commands.

他会是我的顾问 我的守卫
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

就是说 如果有人靠你太近
So, if someone gets too close to you...

他可能要来干涉
He might have to intervene.

把那人拦下
To hold that person back.

直到来者说明来意
Until they've made their intentions known.

那你还在那儿傻站着干什么
Why are you standing all the way over there, then?

外来入侵要开始了哦
A foreign invasion is underway.

看起来你并不需要什么守卫啊
Seems like you don't need a protector.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊
'鸦眼' 铁群岛之王

你母亲在甲板下面 护她周全
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

来亲亲叔叔
Give your uncle a kiss.

哈 来吧 你这个没种的懦夫
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

我生来就是七国的统治者
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

战争已经开始 我已经流了血
The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.

瑟曦会严阵以待
Cersei will be ready.

他们知道我们要来了
They know we're coming

临冬城的私生子
The bastard of Winterfell.

凯岩城的侏儒
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

我记得上次见面还是在绝境长城之上
I believe we last saw each other atop the Wall.

没记错的话 你站在长城边上撒了泡尿
You were pissing off the edge if I remember right.

你这一路走来 添了几道伤疤
Picked up some scars along the road.

长路崎岖 但我们最终还能相聚于此
It's been a long road, but we're both still here.

在下提利昂·兰尼斯特
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

戴佛斯·席渥斯 啊 原来是洋葱骑士
Davos Seaworth. Ah, the Onion Knight.

黑水河之役时我们各为其主
We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

这位是弥桑黛 女王的心腹谋士
Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.

欢迎来到龙石岛
Welcome to Dragonstone.

女王知道此次旅途漫长
Our queen knows it is a long journey.

我代表她感谢您所做的努力
She appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf.

不介意的话 请缴出兵器
If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.

我听不出口音
I can't place the accent.

我生于纳斯岛
I was born on the Island of Naath.

啊 我听说那里非常漂亮
Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.

有棕榈树 有蝴蝶
Palm trees and butterflies.

可惜我没去过
Haven't been, myself.

这地方变了
This place has changed.

珊莎现在可好? 我听说她平安无恙
And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.

她很好 她是否对我寤寐思服? 
She is. Does she miss me terribly?

这桩婚事有名无实 我们从未圆房
A sham marriage. And unconsummated.

我没问过 就是 我是说 没有过
I didn't ask. Well, it was. Wasn't.

反正… 她其实比看上去要聪明得多
Anyway...  she's much smarter than she lets on.

她已经开始展露锋芒了
She's starting to let on.

我倒想听听一个守夜人小卒是怎样成为北境之王的
I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit became King in the North.

你得先告诉我一个兰尼斯特家的人 如何会成为丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的御前首相
As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

那可是个漫长又血腥的故事
A long and bloody tale.

说实话 多半时候我都在醉生梦死
To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.

我的封臣们认定我愚不可及 才会前来龙石岛
My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.

如果我是你的御前首相 我也会谏言反对
If I was your Hand, I would have advised against it.

都是经验之谈
General rule of thumb...

史塔克族人离家南下便会凶多吉少
Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.

没错 但我并不姓史塔克
True...  but I'm not a Stark.

我想说你得习惯它们… 不过确实不容易
I'd say you get used to them...  but you never really do.

来吧 它们的母亲在等你
Come, their mother is waiting for you.

我在想您为什么不去亲自迎接我们的客人
I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.

是您请求我们召见北境之王
You begged us to summon the King in the North.

您难道不想再见他一面? 
Don't you want to see him again?

我已促成冰与火的相聚
I've brought ice and fire together.

您对琼恩·雪诺不吝美言 可当他踏上龙石岛之时 您却躲在这峭壁之上
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow, but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.

没想到您还是个如此害羞的女人
I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

我在列王耳畔呢喃的时代已经结束
My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.

我们这种平民一旦尝到权力的滋味 如同恶狮尝到鲜血
Give us common folk one taste of power, we're like the lion who tasted man.

世上再无这般甜美滋味
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

你我早就不是平民了
Neither of us is common folk anymore.

我与北境之王 还有他的臣属 上次分别得不太愉快
I did not part on good terms with the King in the North or his advisor.

因为我曾犯下的错误
Because of mistakes I made.

我留下也只会扰乱人心
I would only be a distraction if I stayed.

那么您打算去哪里?  瓦兰提斯
So, where will you go? Volantis.

恕我直言
If you don't mind my saying,

您不该再回到维斯特洛
I don't think you should return to Westeros.

我可无法确保您在这里的安全
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

哦 我会回来的 亲爱的蜘蛛
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

最后一次 夫人…
One last time. My lady...

我注定要死在这异乡
I have to die in this strange country.

您面前的是 坦格利安家族的'风暴降生'丹妮莉丝 铁王座合法继承人 安达尔人和先民的合法女王
You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

七大王国守护 龙之母 大草海上的卡丽熙 不焚者 镣铐破除者
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.

他是北境之王
He's King in the North.

公爵大人 感谢您远道而来
Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.

但愿海浪不甚颠簸
I hope the seas weren't too rough.

风浪不大 劳陛下挂念
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

抱歉 可能我这口跳蚤窝口音让您误会了 琼恩·雪诺是北境之王 陛下
Apologies, I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know, but Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.

您不该称他公爵 请问您是…
He's not a lord. Forgive me...

陛下 这位是戴佛斯·席渥斯爵士
Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

恕我无知 戴佛斯爵士
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

我从未接受过正统教育 但我得说 据我了解 托伦·史塔克是末代北境之王 他曾臣服于我的先祖伊耿·坦格利安
I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn I read the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark, who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

跪求我的先祖赦免他和他北境子民的性命
In exchange for his life and the lives of the Northmen,

托伦·史塔克发誓亘古亘今效忠坦格利安家族
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.

或者 是我搞错了? 
Or do I have my facts wrong?

陛下 当时我并不在场
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

但盟誓即是盟誓
But still, an oath is an oath.

亘古亘今则是指… 提利昂大人 亘古亘今所指何意? 
And perpetuity means...  what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

所以 公爵大人 我认为…
So I assume, my lord...

… 您该向我俯首称臣
...you're here to bend the knee.

那真是太可惜
Well, that is unfortunate.

您大老远跑来 就是为了背弃祖先对坦格利安家族的誓言? 
You've traveled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?

令尊活活烧死了我的祖父
Your father burned my grandfather alive.

活活烧死了我的伯父
He burned my uncle alive.

他本来要将七大王国付之一炬…
He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms...

我父亲… 是个坏人
My father... was an evil man.

我以坦格利安家族的名义
On behalf of House Targaryen...

请求您的宽恕 宽恕他对您的家族犯下的罪行
I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.

请您不要以父亲的罪行 评判他女儿的品行
And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.

千百年来我们的家族勠力同心 我们结成盟友的那几百年 是七大王国最好的时代
Our two houses were allies for centuries, and those were the best centuries the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.

千百年的太平盛世 坦格利安国王端坐在铁王座上 北境守护史塔克家族镇守边疆
Centuries of peace and prosperity with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.

我是坦格利安最后的血脉 琼恩·雪诺
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.

请珍视你祖先向我先祖立下的誓言
Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.

臣服于我 我便会任命你为北境守护
Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.

我们联手 就能从祸国者手中 拯救全境
Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.

您并不需要为您父亲的罪孽负责
You're not guilty of your father's crimes.

而我也不受祖先许下的誓言约束
And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.

那你为什么还要来? 
Then why are you here?

因为我需要您的帮助 您也需要我的帮助
Because I need your help, and you need mine.

你来时有没有看见 三条巨龙在你头顶飞翔? 
Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?

那你有没有看见那些 立誓为我杀敌的多斯拉克人? 
And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

他们很显眼
They're hard to miss.

但是你仍然说 我需要你的帮助?  不是帮忙打败瑟曦
But still, I need your help? Not to defeat Cersei.

您可以明天就突袭君临 攻占整座城市
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.

妈的 我们当初没有龙都差点打下来了
Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.

差点 但您现在还没有突袭君临
Almost. But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

我认为 唯一的原因在于 您不想杀害成千上万无辜的百姓
The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.

杀人是赢得战争最快的方法 但您不会这样做 这就说明 至少在这一点上 您比瑟曦要好些
It's the fastest way to win the war, but you won't do it, which means, at the very least, you're better than Cersei.

但这也说明不了我为什么需要你的帮助
Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.

因为现在 您 我 瑟曦 还有其他所有人 我们像是一群玩耍中的孩子 尖叫着抱怨游戏的不公
Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game, screaming that the rules aren't fair.

你跟我说过你喜欢这个人 我确实说过
You told me you liked this man. I do.

从他见我开始的这段时间里 他拒绝称我为女王 拒绝向我臣服 现在他又说我是个孩子
In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow, and now he's calling me a child.

我认为他说的是我们都是孩子 这是一种比喻而已
I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.

陛下 如果我们不击败北方的敌人 所有您认识的人都会在冬天结束之前死去
Your Grace, everyone you know will die before winter's over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.

在我看来 你就是那北方的敌人
As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.

亡者才是您的敌人
The dead are the enemy.

那也是一种比喻吗? 
Is that another figure of speech?

亡者大军正在行进
The Army of the Dead is on the march.

亡者大军? 
The Army of the Dead?

陛下 您也许并不十分了解我 但您觉得我像是骗子或者疯子吗? 
You don't know me well, my lord, but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?

不 我觉得您两者都不是
No, I don't think you're either of those things.

亡者大军是真实存在的
The Army of the Dead is real.

异鬼是真实存在的
The white walkers are real.

夜王也是真实存在的 我都亲眼见过
The Night King is real. I've seen them.

当他们越过长城时 我们如果还在互相争斗… 那我们就完了
If they get past the Wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves...  we're finished.

我出生在龙石岛
I was born at Dragonstone.

但我并不记得这里
Not that I can remember it.

因为在劳勃派来的刺客找上门之前 我们就已经逃走了
We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.

劳勃是你父亲最好的朋友 对吧? 
Robert was your father's best friend, no?

我在想 不知你父亲是否知道 他的挚友会派人 去杀害一个摇篮里的女婴
I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.

当然 这些现在都不要紧
Not that it matters now, of course.

我在异国他乡长大
I spent my life in foreign lands.

试图杀死我的人不计其数
So many men have tried to kill me,

我都记不清他们的名字了
I don't remember all their names.

我曾经像匹母马一样被人卖掉
I have been sold like a broodmare.

被人套上镣铐 又遭到背叛 被强暴 被侮辱
I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.

你知道在我流亡的这些年里 是什么让我坚持住没有倒下吗? 
Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?

不是对神的信仰 也不是对神话和传说的迷信
Not in any gods, not in myths and legends.

对丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的信念
In Daenerys Targaryen.

世人已经几百年没有见到过龙了 直到我的孩子们诞生
The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.

多斯拉克人过去从未渡过海 任何海
The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea.

我生来就是要统治七大王国的 我也定会统治
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms, and I will.

如果我们不打败夜王 您将统治的便是一片坟场
You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.

讨伐我姐姐的战争已经开始了
The war against my sister has already begun.

您不能指望我们一边御敌 一边和您一起对付 您在绝境长城外所看到的那些东西
You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting whatever you saw beyond the Wall.

您不相信他
You don't believe him.

这我理解 他的话听起来确实像胡扯
I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.

但如果命运让丹妮莉丝·坦格利安回到了维斯特洛 命运也同样使琼恩·雪诺成为了北境之王
But if destiny has brought Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.

您是第一个把多斯拉克人带到维斯特洛来的人? 
You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

他可是第一个使野人和北方家族结盟的人
He is the first to make allies of wildlings and Northmen.

他被任命为守夜人的总司令
He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

他被尊为北境之王
He was named King in the North.

不是因为他的出身
Not because of his birthright.

他根本就没什么出身 他就是个私生子
He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard.

那些难伺候的龟孙们选择他当领袖 是因为他们相信他
All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.

那些您难以相信的事物 他都亲自面对过
All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.

为了他的人民 他与之奋战
He fought those things for the good of his people.

为了他的人民 他铤而走险
He risked his life for his people.

为了他的人民 他被刺穿心脏
He took a knife in the heart for his people.

如果我们不能放下彼此之间的敌意团结起来 我们都会死
If we don't put aside our enmities and band together, we will die.

到那时 谁的骷髅架子坐在铁王座上都不重要了
And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

如果真的不重要 那你不妨现在就跪下
If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel.

向丹妮莉丝女王宣誓效忠 帮助她打败我姐姐 之后 我们的军队会联合起来保护北境
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys, help her to defeat my sister, and together, our armies will protect the North.

没时间耗下去了
There's no time for that.

没时间浪费在这些破事上了!
There's no time for any of this!

当我们还傻站在这争论的时候…
While we stand here, debating...

下跪花不了多少时间
It takes no time to bend the knee.

用你的剑向她起誓
Pledge your sword to her cause.

我为什么要那么做呢? 
And why would I do that?

陛下 我无意冒犯 但我并不了解您
I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.

就我目前看来 您对王位的宣称完全依赖于您父亲之名 而我父亲正是为了推翻疯王而发动战争
As far as I can tell, your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name, and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.

北境诸侯 信任我能够领导他们 我将尽我所能继续履行我的职责
The lords of the North placed their trust in me to lead them, and I will continue to do so as well as I can.

同样我也要指明 我是七国合法的女王
It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

你宣称自己是北境的国王 你就是公开造反
By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom, you are in open rebellion.

陛下 请让您的客人先退下
Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.

请原谅我的失礼
You must forgive my manners.

远道而来 两位想必都累了
You'll both be tired after your long journey.

我们会为你们准备洗澡水 并把晚餐送到你们的房间
We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.

我们的铁民和多恩盟友 在前往多恩的途中遭到袭击
Our ironborn and Dornish allies were attacked en route to Dorne.

然后呢?  仅有两三艘船逃脱 其它的 被击沉或被俘虏
And? Two or three ships escaped, the rest, sunk or captured.

艾拉莉亚和沙蛇们 有的死了 有的被俘虏
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, dead or captured.

葛雷乔伊姐弟也一样下落不明
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

你看见他抓住她了? 
You saw him take her?

但是你逃掉了?  我救不了她
But you got away? I couldn't save her.

你要是尽力了就不会出现在这里
You wouldn't be here if you tried.

看看他们 为一位葛雷乔伊家族的人欢呼
Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.

实话实说 我都硬了
I have to be honest, this is making me hard.

你有看到小席恩 跳海之前的表情吗? 
Did you see Little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?

婊子! 婊子! 婊子! 杀人犯!
Whore! Whore! Whore! Murderers!

女王陛下 请接受我的礼物 谨以此代表铁群岛所有忠诚的子民
My queen, please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.

我为您奉上的礼物无人能敌… 那就是正义
I give you what no other man could give...  justice.

为您被害的女儿伸张正义
Justice for your murdered daughter.

你已经证明了自己是十四大洋上最好的船长 是王室真正的盟友
You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas and a true friend to the crown.

您值得的不止一个真正的盟友
You deserve more than a true friend.

你的英勇事迹值得奖赏
And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.

我想要的奖赏只有一个
There's only one reward I want.

你会得偿所愿的… 等赢了战争后再说
You shall have what your heart desires...  when the war is won.

由攸伦·葛雷乔伊指挥我们的海军 詹姆·兰尼斯特带领我们的陆军 维斯特洛的儿女们 将保卫我们的国家
With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daughters of Westeros shall defend our country.

这真是无与伦比 对吧? 
There's nothing quite like it, is there?

人民的爱戴
The love of the people.

不过我猜你应该并不了解
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.

还不是不久前向我姐姐吐口水的同一群暴民
This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.

如果你背叛我们 他们就会看着你插在长枪上的脑袋欢呼
And if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.

他们确实就喜欢断掉的头
They just like severed heads, really.

听着 如果你有任何建议
Listen, if you have any advice at all,

我都很乐意听
I would love to hear it.

当我们闲下来可以像兄弟一样聊聊
When we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.

她是喜欢温柔还是粗暴? 
Does she like it gentle or rough?

嘘 嘘 嘘 嘘 别急 我们等会儿再聊
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now. We'll talk later.

我希望你明白我是理解你的
I want you to know I understand.

即使你我之间是敌人
Even though we're enemies, you and I,

我也懂得驱使着你的那种愤怒
I understand the fury that drives you.

那天我也在场 格雷果爵士捏碎了你情人的头
I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.

都能听见奥柏伦头骨碎裂的声音
I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.

和你的尖叫声
The sound of your scream.

我从未听过那样的声音
I never heard a sound like that.

我想 '这就是真爱吧'
I thought, 'That's true love.'

奥柏伦那天看上去英俊无比 真的
Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did.

身法灵活无人能比
No one moved like him.

用长矛的技巧无可匹敌
No one had such skill with a spear.

就算格雷果爵士也拿他没辙
Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.

要是他没有接着嘲讽
If only he hadn't taunted him.

他大可以一走了之留下可怜的格雷果爵士等死
He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

但这就不是你情人的作风了 对吧? 
But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?

现在他已在六尺之下
Now he's buried somewhere.

而格雷果爵士还在这里 且比任何时候都要强大
And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.

对你来说很难接受吧
That must be difficult for you.

当我的女儿从我身边被带走 我唯一的女儿… 算了 你不经历丧子之痛 怎么能想象得到这种感觉
When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter...  well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.

我用自己的乳汁喂养她 尽管他们说可以让奶妈来做
I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.

我接受不了她被别的女人抱在怀里
I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.

我从未拥有过母亲 但弥赛菈拥有过
I never got to have a mother, but Myrcella did.

她是我的 你却从我身边夺走了她
She was mine, and you took her from me.

你的女儿也是个美人
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

多么完美的多恩美人
Perfect Dornish beauty.

她一定是你的最爱
I imagine she's your favorite.

我懂 我懂 我们不该选最爱的那个 但又怎样 我们不过是凡夫俗子
I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites, but still, we're only human.

我们该爱谁就爱谁
We love whom we love.

抱歉 我听不清你在说什么
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

堵着嘴我可没办法听清你说的话
That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.

一定很崩溃吧
It must be frustrating.

我们都做出了自己的选择
We all make our choices.

你选择杀害我的女儿
You chose to murder my daughter.

你做出那个选择后一定感觉充满力量吧
You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.

现在还觉得有力量吗? 
Do you feel powerful now?

我睡不好
I don't sleep very well.

我躺在床上盯着华盖 想象着各种杀死自己敌人的方式
I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.

如何摧毁艾拉莉亚·沙德 那个捏碎我掌上明珠的女人
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.

我想过让格雷果爵士 像捏碎奥柏伦的头骨一样捏碎你的头骨
I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.

我想这会很有诗意 但是过程很快 太快了
It would be poetic, I suppose, but fast, too fast.

我想过让他捏碎你女儿的头骨
I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.

这张可爱的小脸 像鸭蛋一样被打碎裂开 不 这样不对
The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.

科本是我认识的最聪明的人
Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.

聪明到知道你是用什么毒死了弥赛菈
Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.

漫长的再见 是这个的吧? 
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

漫长的道别 就是这个
The Long Farewell. That's the one.

毒药多久发作? 
How long does the poison take?

很难说…  可能几小时 可能几天
Difficult to say... hours, days.

取决于个人体质
It depends on the subject's constitution.

但必死无疑吧? 噢 是的 陛下 当然了
But death is certain? Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

你的女儿将会死在这牢房里 而你将在这眼睁睁地看她死去
Your daughter will die here in this cell, and you will be here watching when she does.

你将在这儿度过余生
You'll be here the rest of your days.

如果你绝食 我们就把食物硬塞进你喉咙里
If you refuse to eat, we'll force food down your throat.

你会活活看着你女儿腐烂
You will live to watch your daughter rot.

看着那张美丽的脸蛋塌陷下来…
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

从头到尾好好想想你做出的那些选择
All the while contemplating the choices you've made.

确保侍卫每隔几小时就换一次火把
Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.

我一点点都不想让她错过
I don't want her to miss a thing.

你在干嘛? 不能让任何人看到我们
What are you doing? No one can see us like this.

我是七王国的女王 我乐意怎样就怎样
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.

原谅我 陛下
Forgive me, Your Grace.

布拉佛斯来的使者已经到了
The visitor from Braavos has arrived.

很好 我们需要换新床单
Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.

请节哀顺变 陛下 对于您儿子的死我深感遗憾
My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.

大家都说 他是个不错的年轻人
From all reports, he was a fine young man.

铁金库不是派你来此吊唁的
The Iron Bank didn't send you here to offer condolences.

吊唁还有祝贺
Condolences and congratulations.

祝贺您成为第一位统治七国的女王 这是一个了不起的成就
To become the first ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, that's quite an accomplishment.

铁金库欣赏您摆脱封建迷信束缚 为王室排除 企图颠覆法律之徒的方式
The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition, freeing the crown from elements who sought to subvert the rule of law.

贝勒大圣堂的爆炸是一场悲剧的意外
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.

确实如此 但有时候悲剧是必要的 为了恢复秩序和理性的统治
Indeed, but sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.

铁金库想要回自己的黄金
The Iron Bank wants its gold back.

您父亲从未食言
Your father never minced words either.

但 没错 您的债务相当巨大
But, yes, your debts are considerable.

您现在四面受敌
And you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.

我们都知道战争有多耗费钱财
We both know how expensive war can be.

我们也都知道黄金能赢战争
And we both know gold wins wars.

您的财库已经空了
Your vaults are empty.

您已故丈夫的挥霍无度导致如此结果
Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.

您最富有的盟军 提利尔家族 现在是你们的敌人
Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies.

您被王座的觊觎者从各个方向包围
You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.

而铁金库想赌一把谁是赢家
And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.

我们只投资在可能成功的一方
We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.

不过是婉约说法的'赌'
A fancy way of saying 'bet.'

战争已经开始 我已获得首胜
The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.

我除掉了多恩的毒蛇
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

我的舰队掌控着狭海
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

是攸伦·葛雷乔伊的舰队掌控着狭海
Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊对我忠心耿耿
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安有三条成年巨龙
Daenerys Targaryen has three fullgrown dragons.

您的木船和喷火的巨龙相比能有怎样的优势呢? 
How well do wooden ships fare against firebreathing dragons?

她的龙或许没有某些人想的那样坚不可摧
Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.

不过倒是可以来说说这个坦格利安家的女孩
But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.

你想要在她身上投资? 
You want to invest in her?

我猜铁金库在奴隶贸易上投资了相当可观的金子吧
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.

考虑到丹妮莉丝已经解放了所有的奴隶 你的收益怎样? 
How are your profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?

奴隶贸易已经进入了一个低迷期 这的确是事实
The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true.

据我所知 她把她自己看作 一个革命者而不单单是一个统治者
From what I gather, she considers herself more of a revolutionary than a monarch.

就你的经验而谈 银行家与革命者的交易通常做得怎么样呢? 
In your experience, how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?

兰尼斯特家族欠了铁金库一大笔钱 但是兰尼斯特有债必还
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money, but Lannisters always pay their debts.

被解放的奴隶 多斯拉克人 还有巨龙 会这样吗? 
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

有其父必有其女 果真如此
Your father's daughter, indeed.

请作为贵宾留在君临
Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.

当你返回布拉佛斯时
And when you return to Braavos,

我发誓 我的债务将悉数还清
I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.

我到这里反省 没能预判到葛雷乔伊的袭击
I came down here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

你这样是在为难我啊
You're making it difficult.

你看上去比我反省得深刻多了
You look a lot better brooding than I do.

你让我感到好像我没在反省自己的错误
You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.

在这个岛上 我是个囚犯
I'm a prisoner on this island.

我可不这么认为
I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.

你可以自由出入城堡 走到沙滩 去你想去的地方
You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.

我可不这么认为
I wouldn't say we took your ship.

我没心思和你玩文字游戏
I'm not playing word games with you.

亡者大军正冲着我们所有人而来
The dead are coming for us all.

你为何不想想你能做些什么 来弥补我那些损失的船只和被杀的盟友 而我会想想我能做些什么帮你解决那些会走的死人
Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.

我很难彻底明白 真的很难
It's hard for me to fathom. It really is.

要是有人和我说起异鬼和夜王…
If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...

你可能也不相信我
You probably don't believe me.

你叫它们'古怪精灵'
'Grumkins and snarks,' you called them.

你说过那一切都是胡扯
You said it was all nonsense.

那就是胡扯 每个人都知道
It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.

不过紧接着莫尔蒙看到了他们 你也看到了他们
But then Mormont saw them and you saw them.

而我相信诚实之人所见之事 胜过相信普遍的认知
And I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.

我如何才能说服不认识我的人 那些他们认为不存在的敌人会杀光他们? 
How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?

是个好问题 我知道这是个好问题
Good question. I know it's a good question.

我正在寻求答案
I'm looking for an answer.

人们的思维不是为这么复杂的问题准备的
People's minds aren't made for problems that large.

比起异鬼 夜王
White walkers, the Night King,

亡者大军… 面对我姐姐 这样一个更让人自在 熟悉的怪物 几乎就是解脱了
Army of the Dead...  it's almost a relief to confront a comfortable, familiar monster like my sister.

我需要帮助我的人民准备应对即将来临的事情
I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.

呆在这里可不行
I can't help them from here.

如果你这么轻易地放弃 我看你不太可能成为北境之王
It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.

每个人都告诉我要从我父亲的错误中吸取教训
Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.

不要回应疯王的女儿的召唤 她是外来的侵略者
Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.

可我还是来了 一个来自北方的傻瓜
And here I am, a Northern fool.

子辈并不是他们的父辈 幸好我们都是这样
Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.

有时对于外来侵略者 和北方的傻瓜来说要做的不仅仅是会面
And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders and Northern fools than meets the eye.

丹妮莉丝本可以很久以前就向维斯特洛启航 但她没有
Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

她反而留在了她所在之处 拯救许多人于水火之中 他们当中有些人正和我们一起在这岛上
Instead, she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates, some of whom are on this island with us right now.

当你在这里做客时 你或许可以考虑询问他们 对于疯王的女儿他们怎么想
While you're our guest here, you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.

她保护人民不受怪物的危害 就像你一样
She protects people from monsters, just as you do.

这就是她来到这里的原因
It's why she came here.

她不打算北上 去抵抗她从未见过的敌人 仅凭一个她不认识的人所说的话
And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on the word of a man she doesn't know.

和一次简单的会面 这并不是一个合理的要求
After a single meeting, it's not a reasonable thing to ask.

那么 你有没有合理一些的要求? 
So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?

或许你真是一个来自北方的傻瓜
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

我在问有没有我能够帮到你的事情
I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.

也叫火山玻璃 黑曜石
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

他说您这里有着巨大储量的龙晶
He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.

怎么就说到玻璃了? 
Why are we talking about glass?

我们刚刚失去两个盟友
We just lost two of our allies.

所以我刚才在和琼恩·雪诺交谈 他是潜在的盟友
Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

那北境之王想要龙晶来做什么? 
And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?

看起来 它可以制成武器 来杀死异鬼和他们的走卒
Apparently, it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.

我也不确定该用哪个词
Unsure about the nomenclature.

那关于这亡者大军 异鬼和夜王 你怎么看? 
And what do you think about this Army of the Dead and white walkers and Night Kings?

我很想相信琼恩·雪诺是错的
I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong.

但是一个贤者曾说过 你绝不应相信一件事 只是因为你的一厢情愿
But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.

哪位贤者说的这句话? 
Which wise man said this?

你是想把你自己的观点假托先贤之智来阐述吗? 
Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?

我绝不会
I would never do that.

我相信琼恩·雪诺是因为 他来到了这里
The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.

他所有的谋臣都告诉他不要来
All of his advisors would have told him not to come.

我也会告诉他不要来
I would have told him not to come.

可他还是来了
And he's here anyway.

您不必相信他
You don't have to believe him.

让他开采龙晶去吧
Let him mine the dragonglass.

如果他错了 那龙晶也是分文不值
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

您甚至都不知道它在这里
You didn't even know it was here.

给他些他认为有用的东西
Give him something by giving him nothing.

试着去和一个潜在的盟友 建立一个更有成效的关系
Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.

让他有事可做 而我们专注于手中的任务
Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand...

戴佛斯爵士怎么说的来着 为了他的人民 他被刺穿心脏? 
What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?

您得原谅他们的异想天开
You must allow them their flights of fancy.

北方是很乏味的
It's dreary in the North.

多么神奇的生物
Amazing thing to see.

我用我的兄长命名他们 韦赛里斯和雷加
I named them for my brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.

如今他们都去世了
They're both gone now.

你也失去过两个兄弟
You lost two brothers as well.

人们认为龙永远消失了 可现在它们活生生的
People thought dragons were gone forever, but here they are.

或许我们都该审视一下我们的认知
Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.

你和提利昂聊过了
You've been talking to Tyrion.

他很喜欢说话 我们都喜欢做我们擅长的事情
He enjoys talking. We all enjoy what we're good at.

你知道我不会让瑟曦一直坐在铁王座上
You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

当然
I never expected that you would.

我也没有改变 哪些王国属于铁王座的想法
And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to that throne.

我会允许你开采龙晶 用它锻造武器
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

你需要的任何资源和人力 我都提供
Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.

所以 你是相信我关于夜王和亡者大军的那些话了? 
So you believe me, then, about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?

你应该开工了 琼恩·雪诺
You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.

整整一千蒲式耳 小姐
A full thousand bushels, my lady.

对于临冬城现有居民来说
For the current occupants of the castle,

约恩·罗伊斯 这些食物够吃一年 也许一年多
'青铜' 符石城伯爵 it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.

过去一百年间最长的冬天有多长? 
And what's the longest winter in the past hundred years?

呃 我不太确定
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

我 我会查查鲁温学士的记录
II'll check Maester Luwin's records.

他把每封渡鸦来信都做了存档
He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

你的意思是 我们粮食不够了 如果北境军队回来守卫临冬城 就更不够了吧
You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the North come back to defend Winterfell?

是的 小姐 应该不能够
No, my lady, most likely not.

那我们必须为未来的不测做准备了
Then we must prepare for that eventuality.

不管威胁从何而来 这里都是最好的容身之处
Whatever direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.

我们要开始建造粮仓 北境每个城堡都要定期运来粮食
We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the North.

如果冬天过去了 粮食仍有剩余 我们就将其归还
If we don't use it by winter's end, we'll give it back to them.

但是如果北境人都逃来临冬城 那就不用把时间浪费在运送粮食上了
But if the entire North has to flee to Winterfell, they won't have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.

沃尔肯学士 务必办好此事
Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

他们在用皮革覆盖胸甲吗? 
Are they covering those breastplates in leather?

不这么做的话 凛冬真正至此的时候怎么办? 
Well, shouldn't they be? Once the real cold comes?

我问你 为什么这上面没覆皮革? 
You there, why isn't there leather on these?

北境人都面向北方 担忧着长城外的威胁
The Northerners are all facing north, worried about the threat from beyond the Wall.

我是这里最了解瑟曦的人
I know Cersei better than anyone here.

如果你忽视她…
If you turn your back on her...

你不是这里最了解她的人 我只想说…
You don't know Cersei better than anyone here. I only meant to say...

那个杀害了我父母兄长的人非常危险是吗? 
That the woman who murdered my mother, father, and brother is dangerous?

感谢您睿智的忠告
Thank you for your wise counsel.

只有两种可能的结果 一种是死人打败活人 这样的话 我们所有的问题都结束了 另一种是活人胜出
One of two things will happen...  either the dead will defeat the living, in which case...  all our troubles come to an end, or life will win out.

不要单纯地在北境或南方作战
Don't fight in the North or the South.

永远在脑海中设想每一场战斗
Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.

每个人都是你的敌人 也都是你的朋友 所有可能的事件都同时发生
Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend...  every possible series of events is happening all at once.

这样就不会有出乎你意料之事
Live that way and nothing will surprise you.

发生的每件事都会是 你曾经设想过的
Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.

珊莎小姐 请到城门来
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

我希望琼恩也在
I wish Jon were here.

我也是 我有话要对他说
Yes, I need to speak to him.

你是父亲唯一在世的嫡子
You're Father's last living trueborn son.

你现在是临冬城公爵了
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

我永远不会是临冬城公爵
I can never be Lord of Winterfell.

我永远不能封爵封侯
I can never be lord of anything.

我是三眼乌鸦
I'm the ThreeEyed Raven.

我不知道这是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

很难解释
It's difficult to explain.

这意味着我有能力洞察一切
It means I can see everything.

任何人发生过的任何事
Everything that's ever happened to everyone.

任何当下发生的事
Everything that's happening right now.

现在对我来说都是时间的片段
It's all pieces now, fragments.

我需要学会更好地洞察一切
I need to learn to see better.

当长夜再次降临
When the Long Night comes again,

你怎么知道这些的? 
How do you know all this?

三眼乌鸦教给我的
The ThreeEyed Raven taught me.

你不是说你就是三眼乌鸦么
I thought you were the ThreeEyed Raven.

我告诉你了这很难解释
I told you it's difficult to explain.

我为你经历的那些事感到伤心
I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.

我很伤心 那些事发生在这个家里
I'm sorry it had to happen here in our home.

那个夜晚真美
It was so beautiful that night.

雪花飘落 就像现在
Snow falling, just like now.

而你那么美 穿着白色的结婚礼服
And you were so beautiful...  in your white wedding dress.

我必须回去了 布兰
I have to go back inside, Bran.

我要再待一会儿
I'll stay a bit longer.

有点疼 比原来要轻
A bit. Less than before.

看起来感染消退了
The infection no longer appears to be active.

就算有人说是表层患病皮肤被剥掉了 似乎都说得过去 此外 皮下的部分还给上了药膏
One could almost be forgiven for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.

不知道你说的是什么
Don't know anything about that.

我就是觉得有所好转了
I just started feeling better.

我猜是休息起作用了
I assumed it was the rest that did it.

您可以离开了 爵士
You're free to go, ser.

这间屋子是给传染病病人的 而你不再是了
This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.

塔利 今晚我想在我的书房和你谈谈
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.

到了晚上我就知道了
Suppose I'll find out this evening.

我从看到自己染病的那刻起 就向它投降了
I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.

我知道自己会病死 或者在那之前自杀
I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.

风暴降生丹妮莉丝让我相信还有希望
Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.

我的归宿就是回到她身边
The only place for me is back with her.

你父亲不止一次救过我
Your father saved me more than once.

我无以为报
It's the least I could do.

也许我们会再次相遇
Perhaps our paths will cross again.

你给他提供治疗了? 是的
You treated him? Yes.

谁叫你治他的? 
Who told you to treat him?

谁曾禁止你 禁止任何人试图治疗他? 
Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?

我记得是你
I seem to remember you.

即便如此你还是治疗了他? 是的
But you treated him anyway? I did, yes.

我禁止你 是因为这样做危险 成功率低 尤其是他那个年纪的患者
I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful, especially on someone of that age.

你可能让自己和他人都被传染
You could have infected yourself and others.

你可能毁了整个学城
You could have devastated the entire Citadel.

这个手术需要绝对谨慎 非常难以实施
It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.

很多链条上有医术之环的学士 其尝试都以失败告终
Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.

我研读了书本 遵循上面的指导
I read the books and followed the instructions.

那个人因你而生
That man is alive because of you.

谢谢你 博士
Thank you, Archmaester.

这些手稿和卷轴都要霉烂了
All these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away.

我需要你把他们另外抄写一份
I need you to make copies of them.

你在想奖赏
You were expecting a reward.

你的奖赏就是不被学城即刻驱逐
Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.

你最好开始干活
You'd better get started.

小心纸里的蛀虫
And careful of the paper mites.

它们也喜欢人肉
They like flesh as well.

我们得找到攸伦·葛雷乔伊的舰队 并将其击沉
We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

陛下 他已经摧毁了我们的大部分
Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.

如果派剩余的船追击…
To send our remaining ships after him...

我说的不是派船去追
I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.

您有必要亲自去吗? 
Would you have to go yourself?

攸伦的舰队可能在任何地方 也可能分散各地
Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.

真不知道 您要在开阔的海面上 独自飞多久啊
You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.

我有卓耿 韦塞里昂和雷哥
I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal.

凡人能拿它们怎样? 
What can anyone do to them?

可敌人能染指于您
They can still do something to you.

哪怕一支利箭呢
It only takes one arrow.

这么做风险太大 您可是重中之重
It's too great a risk. You're too important.

凯岩城那边情况如何? 
What about Casterly Rock?

无垢者将很快抵达凯岩城
The Unsullied will be there soon.

他们会面临什么情况? 
And what will they face?

一场血战
A difficult situation.

他们知道我们会来
They know we're coming.

没错 瑟曦认定我毕生的目标 就是摧毁兰尼斯特家族
Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.

从未有人能攻下凯岩城 弓箭手!
No one has ever taken the Rock. Archers!

兰尼斯特大军仍是那支由我父亲亲手打造的军队
The Lannister Army is still the army my father built.

准备战斗! 他们训练有素 补给充足
Come on! Welltrained and wellprovisioned.

他们知道我们会来
They will see us coming.

凯岩城大门固若金汤
The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.

高墙难以逾越
The fight up the walls will be hard.

局面对我们不利
We will be at a disadvantage.

正如我父亲当年所言
Just as my father said they would.

关于我父亲 有些事很有意思 他重振整个家族于危难之际
Interesting thing about my father...  he built our house up from near ruin.

训练出一支强有力的部队 还建起了凯岩城 可他却没铺设下水道
He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.

区区小事 何足劳动父亲大人 他把这活儿交给身边最不值一提之人 也就是我
That was beneath him, so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find...  me.

没错 我身份低贱
He was right, I was low.

我身边的人 同样卑微
The company I kept, low.

在凯岩城 她们并不受欢迎
They weren't welcome at the Rock.

父亲也不认可我和她们厮混在一起
Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.

我没法带着她们从大门堂堂正正而入
Couldn't walk them through the front gates,

也不能把她们带到内廷 那么在修建水道的过程中
I couldn't have them in my chambers, so in the process of building the sewers,

我为自己动了点小手脚
I threw in something for myself.

这是一条通道 起点在海边一个不起眼的小湾 止于主哨塔的底部
It was a passage that began in an out of the way cove by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.

没有哪儿比地底更适合追求低级趣味了
No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.

凯岩城宛如铜墙铁壁 这话儿没错
Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.

但我某个朋友也曾说过
But as a good friend of mine once said,

无垢者直面兰尼斯特军队
They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.

他们以少迎多
They will be outnumbered.

且装备不足
They will have less armor and fewer weapons.

可兰尼斯特军队是出于恐惧而效忠我的姐姐
But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.

无垢者则为了更宏伟之愿
The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.

那就是自由 以及解放他们的人
They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.

他们为您而战
They will be fighting for you.

正是如此 我们胜券在握
And that is why they will triumph.

兰尼斯特其他士兵哪去了? 
Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

如今 雨水在我们厅中哭泣
And now the rains weep o'er our halls.

呃 跟预想中的差不多吧
Uh, as well as could be expected.

战斗从不是我们的强项
It was never our forte.

毕竟是金玫瑰
Golden roses, indeed.

你的弟弟和他的女王 认为你眼下应在镇守凯岩城
Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.

事实却是凯岩城的价值已大不如从前
The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.

怎么说呢 凯岩城对我非常珍贵 但我的童真岁月 可不能帮瑟曦坐稳王位
Well, it is to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.

那你就这么拱手让人了? 
So you just let them take it?

那只是暂时的 他们没法长期守住城
For now. They won't be able to hold it.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊率军烧了他们的船只 在离开之前 我们清空了粮仓
Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.

最终他们不得不放弃这个据点 横穿维斯特洛大陆
Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.

而你带着你的军队 你的绝对主力 去了他们不本该去的地方
And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't.

罗柏·史塔克在呓语森林就是这样摆了我一道
As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.

人总得从失败中吸取教训
There are always lessons in failures.

的确 现在的你一定是个智者了
Yes. You must be very wise by now.

父亲总说我学东西慢
My father always said I was a slow learner.

如果他当真聪明 为什么他不在金矿枯竭时 就拿下高庭呢? 
If he was so clever, why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?

我想 很快我就能当面问问他了
I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.

从我的错误就没什么教训可学了 对吧? 
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?

那曾是乔佛里的剑吧? 
That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?

可他没机会用
Not that he ever used it.

他真是个混蛋啊
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

为了保护家庭 我做了难以启齿的事
I did unspeakable things to protect my family.

或看着这些事按我的命令被人执行
Or watched them being done on my orders.

我从不会因此难以入睡
I never lost a night's sleep over them.

为了提利尔家的安全 我做了能想到的一切
And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.

但你的姐姐所做的…
But your sister has done things...

我压根无法想象
I was incapable of imagining.

这是我的错误 理应受罚 错在缺乏想象力
That was my prize mistake...  a failure of imagination.

她是个怪物 你明白的吧? 
She's a monster, you do know that?

可是 我们获胜之后 反对的人将烟消云散 而人们平静地生活在瑟曦一手建立的国度 你真认为他们会计较她达成的方式吗? 
But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, when people are living peacefully in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?

你的确爱着她
You really do love her.

你会折在她的手里
She'll be the end of you.

就算这样 和你讨这些也不会有什么益处 不是吗? 
Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?

那你有更好的讨论对象吗? 
What better person to discuss it with?

谁还能像我一样保证 你说的话一定不会传出这间屋子? 
What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?

或许 你是对的
But perhaps you're right.

如果她能把你带偏这么远 那一定有什么是你根本控制不了的
If she's driven you this far, it's gone beyond your control.

我后悔自己曾为虎作伥
I regret my role in spreading it.

就这样吧
I think we're done here.

瑟曦有好几个想法
Cersei had several ideas.

让你游街 在红堡前斩首
Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.

活剥你 把你吊在君临城外墙上
Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.

我说服了她
I talked her out of those.

不会 我保证
No. I made sure of that.

我讨厌你儿子那种死法
I'd hate to die like your son.

手掐着脖子 口吐白沫 双眼充血 皮肤泛紫
Clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes bloodred, skin purple.

作为御林铁卫 作为父亲 你一定吓坏了吧
Must have been horrible for you, as a Kingsguard, as a father.

我也觉得挺可怕的
It was horrible enough for me.

根本不是我想象中那样
Not at all what I intended.

毕竟我之前没见过毒药发作
You see, I had never seen the poison work before.

凶手是我 我想让她知道这点
I want her to know it was me.

恢复对这片土地 和人民的统治 是我当前的唯一赌注
My only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.

我的全部盟友都失败了
All my allies are gone.

您还有铁金库 只要金子运到
You can count on the Iron Bank. As soon as the gold arrives.

就足够开展计划了
Enough with the clever plans.

你刚刚赢得了世界上最丰厚的战利品
You've just won the biggest prize in the world.

还忧郁个啥? 
What could you possibly have to be upset about?

没事儿 你尽管告诉我
Come on, you can tell me.

荆棘女王在临死之前 最后还刺了你的蛋蛋吗? 
Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?

我还是去找总主教倾诉衷肠吧
I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.

已经没有什么总主教了
There is no more High Septon.

对 没有了 不是吗? 
No, there isn't, is there?

但是我的那份奖赏可不能没有
There is still the question of my prize.

我刚给你的钱可够多了
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

那边那座怎么样? 它刚好缺个主人呢
How about that one? It's available.

你不会想要高庭的
You don't want Highgarden.

我可不敢苟同 现在是战争时期
I beg to differ. We're at war.

你搬进城堡不到两天 丹妮莉丝・坦格利安就可能会把它夺回去
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.

另外 考虑下维护费
Besides, think of the upkeep.

你拥有的越多 要承担的也就越重
The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.

哦 这就是你他妈这么丧气的原因? 
Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?

新抢来的金子成了你的无法承受之重? 
All your new riches weighing you down?

出发! 那些金子不是我的
Move out! They're not mine.

它们都归铁金库所有
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

看到了没? 我们有债必还
See? We pay our debts.

好吧 就是没还我的
Right, just not to me.

黑水河的波隆爵士 出身于… 管你出身于哪个不知名的臭屎堆 带着满满一挎包的金子 还在抱怨自己没得到足够的回报
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of...  whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold, complaining about not getting paid.

等我们赢了这场战争 再也没有人能从你手中抢走东西 七大王国的所有城堡 任你挑选
When we win this war, all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from, with no one left to take them away from you.

是啊 我非常确信瑟曦女王的统治 将会宁静而祥和
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceable.

比这更离谱的事情也不是没发生过
Ah, stranger things have happened.

大人 所有的粮仓已被清空 粮食都装在马车上了
The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.

那现在地里的庄稼呢? 我们已让好几队人马去收割 河湾地的所有农田
The current harvest? We have teams of men collecting it from all the farms in the Reach.

波隆爵士 你愿意协同塔利家族 帮助他们加快进程吗? 
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys and help them accelerate this process?

我不太擅长收割小麦
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

没错 但督促那些顽抗的农夫交出他们的收成
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest

我确信你对此肯定很有一套
I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.

不得不承认 铁金库从未 有过在如此短期内就迅速还清的巨额债款
I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.

我过去总是认为您的父亲是一位雷厉风行的人 但如今您彻底重新定义了这个词语
I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.

大人 您太客气了
You're too kind, my lord.

陛下 我既不客气也不是什么大人
I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.

我只是我所代表的机构的一枚棋子
I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.

铁金库的运转是个算术问题 感性无济于事
Its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.

而目前的运算结果让我们非常满意
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

呃 黄金…  在路上了
Uh, the gold... Is on its way.

由我弟弟亲自护送
My brother is supervising its transportation himself.

看来铁金库有人要失望了
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.

他们可是觊觎您的利息很久了
They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.

我们得想办法让他们打起精神才好
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

是啊 对于眼下您要下的赌注 说不定我们能帮上忙呢
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.

此刻我要下的唯一赌注就是重新统治维斯特洛大陆 统治维斯特洛的每个人
My only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.

我觉得这笔投资能带来巨大的回报
I see a great deal of potential in that venture.

我想您或许需要一些来自他人的资助
I imagine it would require outside investment.

我需要壮大陆军 海军
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

我的女王之手 科本 已向厄斯索斯的黄金团发出邀请
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.

他们曾帮我们从那些欠债不还的人那里追回过不少钱
They have helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.

我也希望他们能为我追回本属于我的东西
I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.

您大可放心 女王陛下 铁金库会成为您值得信赖的盟友
Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support.

唔 只要金子一到
Hmm. As soon as the gold arrives.

上一个使用它的人曾想用它割断你的喉咙 但你母亲阻止了他
The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.

而另一把匕首 夺走她性命的那把
The other dagger, the one that took her life,

我愿意替她挡掉那把匕首 如果我在场的话
I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.

她最需要我时 我竟不在她身旁
I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.

但现在我就在这儿 替她完成她最想做的事情 保护她的孩子
But I am here for her now to do what she would have done, to protect her children.

布兰登 如果有什么需要我做的 尽管开口
Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.

你知道这把匕首是谁的么? 
Do you know who this belonged to?

正是这把不知其主的匕首挑起了五王之战
That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.

某种程度而言 正是这把匕首让你变成了今天的样子
In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.

背井离乡 流亡到长城外的蛮荒之地
Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.

我想你一定目睹了常人无法想象的事物
I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.

历经磨难 千辛万苦重回家乡 却发现这个世界只剩如此这般的混乱
To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world,

我很抱歉打扰您 史塔克大人
I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.

沃肯学士帮我做的 我行动起来能更方便一些
Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.

这办法真不错
It's a very good idea.

我不想离开你的 但是当… 当异鬼来的时候
I don't want to leave you, but whenwhen they come,

我要和我的家人在一起
I need to be with my family.

呃 至少和其他人一样安全
Well, as safe as anyone can be now.

你不再需要我了
You don't need me anymore.

你想说的就这些? 
That's all you've got to say?

我弟弟为你而死
My brother died for you.

阿多和夏天为你而死
Hodor and Summer died for you.

我也差点为你而死
I almost died for you.

布兰…  我并不是布兰
Bran... I'm not, really.

我记得身为布兰登・史塔克的那些时光 但如今我记得太多其他事情了
I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.

你在那个山洞里就死了
You died in that cave.

我上了那个厨娘 红头发那个 从后面
I did the kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind.

你唯一能在厨房干的就是那些内脏
The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.

站住! 往哪儿走呢? 
'Ey up. Where you going?

让我进去 我住这儿
In there. I live here.

我是艾莉亚・史塔克 这是我家
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

通报鲁温学士或者罗德利克爵士
Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrick.

他们会告诉你我是谁 这里没有罗德利克爵士
They'll tell you who I am. There's no Rodrick here.

只有沃肯学士
Maester's named Wolkan.

那就去问问北境之王琼恩・雪诺
Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North.

他是我哥哥 他离这儿可有一千里地呢
He's my brother. He's a thousand miles away.

你给我听着 天儿很冷 我们也很忙 所以 识相点 最好马上滚 嗯
Look, it's cold and we're busy, so, you know, best fuck off. Mm.

琼恩要是走了 那现在谁在掌管临冬城? 
If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?

临冬城公爵夫人 史塔克小姐
The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.

哪个史塔克小姐?  你说呢
Which Lady Stark? You tell us.

你不是正在这儿冒充她妹妹嘛
You're the one impersonating her sister.

告诉珊莎 她妹妹回家了
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

珊莎小姐很忙 没空跟你浪费功夫 我们也一样
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.

所以 最后警告你一次 滚蛋
So, for the last time, fuck off.

无论如何 我都要进入这座城堡
I'm getting into this castle one way or another.

如果我并非我所宣称的身份 我便不会久留
If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.

但如果我所言非虚 而珊莎发现你们将我拒之门外…
But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away...

好吧 你坐在这儿
Right, you sit there.

好了 你去通报史塔克小姐 我来看住她
Right, go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

我才不要通报史塔克小姐 要去你去
I ain't telling Lady Stark. You can tell her.

你去通报 我才不
You're gonna tell her. I'm not.

如果你不去 我就一拳揍在你那张逼脸上 要多狠有多狠
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.

我们就站在她旁边 然后…
We were standing right next to her, and...

然后 然后我们一转身她就不见了 小姐
Andand when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady.

她 她不算什么 就是个临冬城镇上的女孩
Sheshe was nothing. Some winter town girl.

她一进来就要找 呃 罗德利克爵士
She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrik...

罗德利克 对 还有 鲁温 对 … 还有鲁温学士
Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah. ...and Maester Luwin.

别在这种小事上劳心费神 小姐
And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady.

我们会 我们会找到她的 你们不用找了
We'llwe'll find her. You don't have to.

我是不是该叫你史塔克夫人了? 
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

你不用从守卫身边逃走的
You shouldn't have run from the guards.

守卫不太行
You need better guards.

挺适合你的…  史塔克夫人
It suits you... Lady Stark.

琼恩把你留在这管事? 
Jon left you in charge?

我真希望他能早点回来
I hope he comes back soon.

我还记得他见到我时有多么欣喜若狂
I remember how happy he was to see me.

如果见到你 他可能心脏都不会跳了
When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.

看起来根本不像他
It doesn't look like him.

应该由熟悉他长相的人来雕刻的
Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.

熟悉他长相的人都死了
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

传闻说是你杀了乔佛里
They say you killed Joffrey.

听说有人捷足先登时 我很生气
I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.

不管我的名单有多长 他永远都排在首位
However long my list got, he was always first.

我要杀的人的名单
Of people I'm going to kill.

你是怎么回到临冬城的? 
How did you get back to Winterfell?

我想你也一样
I imagine yours is, too.

不是个让人开心的故事
Not a very pleasant one.

但我们的故事还未结束
But our stories aren't over yet.

我看到你在十字路口客栈
I saw you at the crossroads.

现在的我能看到很多事物
I see quite a lot now.

我以为你要去君临城
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

你要回去干嘛? 
Why would you go back there?

瑟曦在她的名单上
Cersei's on her list of names.

还有谁在你的名单上? 
Who else is on your list?

他们大多数都已经死了
Most of them are dead already.

你从哪弄来的? 
Where did you get this?

小指头给我的
Littlefinger gave it to me.

小指头? 他在这儿? 
Littlefinger? He's here?

他已宣誓效忠史塔克家族
He has declared for House Stark.

他为什么要给你一把匕首? 
Why would he give you a dagger?

他以为我想要 为什么? 
He thought I'd want it. Why?

因为它本是用来刺杀我的
Because it was meant to kill me.

刺客…  你坠楼后那个? 
The cutthroat... after your fall?

为什么一个刺客能有瓦雷利亚钢匕首? 
Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?

应该是某位权贵想让我死
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

小指头不是个大方的人
He's not a generous man.

他不会轻易付出 除非他觉得从中有利可图
He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.

这不重要 为什么不重要? 
It doesn't matter. What do you mean it doesn't matter?

在瘸子手上是浪费
It's wasted on a cripple.

凯特琳・史塔克会为您骄傲的
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

我几乎什么都没做
I did next to nothing.

小姐 您对您自己太过苛刻了
You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

陛下 无垢者那边依然没有消息
Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.

他会回到你身边的
He will come back to you.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
'风暴降生'  在龙石岛的女王

在我们成批开采之前 我想让您先看点东西
I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.

就是这些了 我们所需要的就是如此
Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.

陛下 我还有些别的东西想向您展示
There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.

这些是森林之子刻下的
The children of the forest made these.

很久很久以前
A very long time ago.

他们就在这里 站在我们所站的地方
They were right here, standing where we're standing.

在坦格利安 史塔克 还有兰尼斯特这些家族存在之前
Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.

也许 甚至在人类存在之前
Maybe even before there were men.

森林之子和先民曾一同在此
They were here together, the children and the First Men.

做什么? 彼此打来打去? 
Doing what? Fighting each other?

他们一同对抗他们共同的敌人
They fought together against their common enemy.

摒弃彼此之间的差异与猜忌
Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.

要想活命 我们也得这么做
We need to do the same if we're going to survive.

因为敌人是真实存在的
Because the enemy is real.

一直都是
It's always been real.

你说如果没有我的龙和军队 就不能击败他们? 
And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?

是的 我觉得我做不到
No, I don't think I can.

我会为你而战
I will fight for you.

我会为北境而战
I will fight for the North.

只要你俯首称臣
When you bend the knee.

我的人民… 恐怕不会接受一个南方的统治者
My people...  won't accept a southern ruler.

尤其是在他们遭受了那些事以后
Not after everything they've suffered.

如果他们的国王接受 他们也会的
They will if their king does.

他们选择你去领导他们
They chose you to lead them.

他们选择你去保护他们
They chose you to protect them.

他们的生命难道不比你的傲气更重要吗? 
Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

我们攻下了凯岩城
We took Casterly Rock.

听起来不错啊
That's very good to hear.

您还是和自己人私下讨论吧
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.

也许…  你们留下
PerhapsYou will stay.

我失去了所有的盟友
All my allies are gone.

他们被一网打尽而我却一直闲坐在这岛上
They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.

您仍然拥有最大的军队 他们没饭可吃 因为瑟曦夺走了河湾地所有的粮食
You still have the largest armies. Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

把灰虫子和无垢者召回来
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

我们仍然有足够的船把多斯拉克人载到大陆
We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.

我们要专注于封锁君临
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

我们的计划仍然可行
We have a plan. It's still the right plan.

你的策略让我们失去了多恩 铁群岛以及河湾地
Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

如果我低估了我们的敌人 我们的敌人? 
If I have underestimated our enemiesOur enemies?

你是说你的家人
Your family, you mean.

也许你根本就不想伤害他们
Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.

我受够了这些高明的计划
Enough with the clever plans.

我有三条巨龙
I have three large dragons.

我打算骑着它们飞到红堡
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

我们商量过这个…
We've discussed this.

我的敌人就在红堡里
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

如果我不甘冒生命危险打败他们 我算个什么女王? 
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?

你觉得我该怎么做? 
What do you think I should do?

我没想过…  我处于战争当中
I would never presume toI'm at war.

你觉得我到底该怎么做? 
What do you think I should do?

我从没想过龙还会再出现
I never thought that dragons would exist again.

那些追随您的人 知道您做了件不可能做到的事
The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.

或许这会让他们相信 您还能创造其他奇迹
Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.

您会打破人们所熟知的那个肮脏的旧世界 建立前所未有的新世界
Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.

但是如果你用龙熔化城堡 烧毁城市 你就没什么特别的
But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.

只是个新的暴君
You're just more of the same.

别让敌人带着你跑
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

根本就别和她这样的人打
Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

他们要是还没给仓库交够粮食 恐怕就只能带来多少吃多少了
If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores, then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.

我很久没练习了
It's been a while since I trained.

我去给您找总教头 小姐
I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.

他可没有打赢过猎狗
He didn't beat the Hound.

我想跟你练练
I want to train with you.

你起过誓要效忠于我母亲的两个女儿 是吧? 
You swore to serve both my mother's daughters, didn't you?

你不能用那个 小姐 太小了
You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.

我不会弄伤你的 别担心
I won't cut you. Don't worry.

这些都是谁教你的
Who taught you how to do that?

你觉得她怎么样?  谁? 
What do you think of her? Who?

我知道你很清楚我问的是谁
I believe you know of whom I speak.

我觉得她有颗仁心
I think she has a good heart.

我是发现你盯着人家的'仁心'看来着
I've noticed you staring at her good heart.

没那个闲工夫
There's no time for that.

我见过夜王 戴佛斯 我曾和他对视
I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes.

我们在北境有多少人能和他作战? 
How many men do we have in the North to fight him?

说到'仁心' 纳斯的弥桑黛在这儿
Speaking of good heartsMissandei of Naath.

戴佛斯爵士 雪诺大人
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

不行 听起来怪怪的
No, that doesn't sound right.

琼恩国王?  这不重要
King Jon? It doesn't matter.

不好意思 我能问个问题吗? 
Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

为什么您父亲的名字是奈德・史塔克 您却叫琼恩・雪诺? 
Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?

我母亲并未与我父亲成婚
My mother and father weren't married.

纳斯的习俗不是这样吗? 
Is the custom different in Naath?

我们纳斯没有婚姻制度 所以根本不存在私生子的概念
We don't have marriage in Naath, so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

听起来挺… 自由的
That sounds... liberating.

你为什么离开家乡? 
Why did you leave your homeland?

我是被奴隶贩子拐走的
I was stolen away by slavers.

恕我冒昧 你是如何从一个奴隶女孩 变成丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的顾问的? 
If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?

她从奴隶主手中将我买下 给我自由
She bought me from my master and set me free.

真是了不起
That was good of her.

当然 现在你就效忠于她了 对吧
Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?

我效忠我的女王是因为我想这么做
I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.

因为我信赖她
Because I believe in her.

要是你明天想驾船回纳斯老家呢? 
And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?

那么她会给我一艘船 然后祝我好运
Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

从厄斯索斯随她而来的所有人 我们都相信她
All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.

她之所以是我们的女王 不是因为她是某个我们根本不认识的国王的女儿
She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.

而是因为我们自己选择了她
She's the queen we chose.

要是我换个边站 你能原谅我吗? 
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

那是葛雷乔伊家的船吗? 
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

我没想到你在这儿
I didn't know you were here.

珊… 珊莎 她还好吗?
SSansa...  is she all right?

要不是念在你还算帮过她 我现在已经杀了你了
What you did for her...  is the only reason I'm not killing you.

听说你叔叔突袭了你们的舰队
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.

我们都以为你死了
We thought you were dead.

我是来求女王帮我救她回来的
I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.

饮马!
Get the horses watered!

金子已经全部安全运进君临城门
All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.

我们得让最后几车辎重 赶在日落前渡过黑水河
We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.

如果运输前线遭遇伏击 那么后方肯定来不及救援
The head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.

也对 运输线拖的有点长了
Well, we are stretched a bit thin.

那么请您准许 用鞭子抽打那些掉队的 会更有效率
With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.

可以 但动手之前必须先有口头警告
Let's give them fair warning first.

毕竟这些人都在高庭拼过命
These men fought well at Highgarden.

来来来 把这东西抱住了
Now, get it on this thing.

我听说了你在高庭的英勇表现
I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.

说点实话吧 你父亲又没在这儿
Come on, your father's not here.

从小到大 我们都一直效忠于提利尔家族
All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.

他们当中的不少人我都认识 也一起打过猎
I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.

他们确实死的可惜
They didn't deserve to die.

要怪只能怪奥莲娜夫人背叛了她的女王 投向了坦格利安家那女孩
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her queen and support the Targaryen girl.

可我从来没想到战场上会是这种气味
I didn't expect it to smell like that.

人在快死的时候会屎尿横流
Men shit themselves when they die.

你们公子哥上的学校不教这个吗? 
Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

好吧 我五岁的时候就知道了
Well, I learned it when I was five.

全副武装! 全副武装!
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

什么情况?  列队!
What is it? Get in line!

全副武装! 全副武装!
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

布阵! 动起来 小伙子们!
Form up! Come on, lads!

列队! 列队!
Form a line! Form a line!

弓箭手准备! 靠近一点!
Archers, steady! Hold together!

预备! 他们来了!
Ready! Here they come!

小伙子们 勇敢点! 勇敢点!
Courage, lads! Courage!

长矛准备! 稳住! 保持阵型!
Spears out! Steady! Hold the line!

快回君临吧 我决不会抛下自己的军队
Get back to King's Landing. I'm not abandoning my army.

你是指挥官 不是小兵蛋子
You're the commander, not a damn infantryman.

这些混账就要包围我们了
Those fuckers are about to swamp us.

我们能守得住
We can hold them off.

守住 小伙子们! 保持阵型!
Hold it, lads! Hold the line!

弓箭手列队! 列队!
Archers, to the line! To the line!

科本的弩炮在那边
Qyburn's scorpion is over there.

我只有一只手怎么用
I can't shoot with one hand.

来吧 宝贝儿 驾!
Come on, boy. Come on!

傻子 真他妈是个傻子
You idiot. You fucking idiot.

我来到这里不是为了杀戮
I'm not here to murder.

你们要么屈膝效忠于我
Bend the knee and join me.

要么… 死路一条
Or refuse... and die.

你必须想办法让她听进去
You need to find a way to make her listen.

顺我者昌 逆我者亡
Whatever stands in our way...  we will defeat.

布兰看到过夜王跟他的大军 正往东海望去
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.

恶战将至
Bad things are coming.

你差点搞死我
You could've killed me.

你他妈刚刚是在搞什么? 
The fuck were you doing back there?

你看到那条龙挡在她身前了吗
You saw the dragon between you and her?

在我得到你欠我的东西之前 龙杀不了你 你自己也杀不了你 只有我能杀了你
Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you, you don't get to kill you, only I get to kill you.

这只是一条龙
That was only one of them.

如果她决定使用它们的力量 真正发挥它们的作用
If she decides to use them, to really use them...

那你就完蛋了 是我们都完蛋了
You're fucked. Don't you mean we're fucked?

真有那么一天的话 我们的合作就到那为止了
Dragons are where our partnership ends.

那些东西朝着君临喷火的时候 我绝对不会留在那里
I'm not gonna be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.

我必须告诉瑟曦
I have to tell Cersei.

那你不如跳回河里去
May as well jump back in that river.

我知道瑟曦是如何跟你们说的
I know what Cersei has told you.

她说我会摧毁你们的城市
That I've come to destroy your cities,

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安 烧毁你们的家园 杀了你们 然后让你们的孩子成为孤儿
'风暴降生'  在龙石岛的女王 burn down your homes, murder you, and orphan your children.

那是瑟曦・兰尼斯特的作风 不是我的
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

我来到这里不是为了杀人 而我唯一想要摧毁的是 给了瑟曦・兰尼斯特这种人能为了一己之私 剥削一切富人穷人的社会制度
I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.

我给你们一个选择的机会… 臣服于我 加入我的军队
I offer you a choice bend the knee and join me.

我们将共同创造一个新世界 走向更美好的明天
Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it.

或者选择拒绝… 然后被处死
Or refuse...  and die.

请上前来 大人
Step forward, my lord.

我已经宣誓效忠于一位女王了
I already have a queen.

她是最近才成了你的女王的 对吧? 
She wasn't your queen until recently, though, was she?

她杀了你本该拥护的女王 彻底毁灭了提利尔家族
When she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.

似乎您的忠诚有些不坚定啊
So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.

在战争中做出任何选择都非易事
There are no easy choices in war.

不管你怎么说你姐姐 她出生于维斯特洛
Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros.

一辈子都住在这里
She's lived here all her life.

而你呢 杀了你的亲生父亲 拥护一个外国侵略者
You, on the other hand, murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader.

一个与这片土地毫不相干的侵略者… 依靠的还是一支野蛮人组成的军队
One with no ties to this land...  with an army of savages at her back.

你宁愿赴死也要守护自己的荣誉
You will not trade your honor for your life.

或许可以让他披上黑衣 陛下
Perhaps he could take the Black, Your Grace.

无论如何 他都是个真正的战士
Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.

他可以在长城上发挥自己的价值
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

你不能发配我去长城
You cannot send me to the Wall.

你不是我的女王
You are not my queen.

你应该连我一同杀死
You will have to kill me, too.

退回去 闭上你的嘴
Step back and shut your mouth.

我是狄肯・塔利 蓝道・塔利之子
I am Dickon Tarly, son of Randyll Tarly.

你是你们家族未来的希望
You are the future of your house.

这场战争已经抹消掉一个伟大的家族了
This war has already wiped one great house from the world.

不要让这种悲剧再发生一次了 跪下臣服吧
Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.

陛下 把他关进牢里呆几周 他就不会做这么鲁莽的决定了
Your Grace, nothing scrubs bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.

我不是来给他们铐上枷锁的
I'm not here to put men in chains.

如果有这个选项 许多人都会接受
If that becomes an option, many will take it.

我给过他们选择的机会
I gave them a choice.

陛下 如果你开始把整个家族斩首…
Your Grace, if you start beheading entire families

我可没说过要斩首
I'm not beheading anyone.

蓝道・塔利伯爵 狄肯・塔利
Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

我 坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝一世
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,

镣铐破除者 龙之母 判处你们死刑
Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.

我们损失了多少兵力? 
How many men did we lose?

暂时还没有彻底清点完
We haven't done a full accounting.

打赢战争不能只靠军队
It's not only armies that win wars.

我们有提利尔家族的黄金 有铁金库的支持
We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.

我们可以雇用佣兵
We can buy mercenaries.

虽然不如自己的军队 但也会为我们而战 只要我们给够钱 这点我们会做到的
Not the same as our men, but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.

我刚刚见识到多斯拉克人是如何作战的
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

他们能打败任何雇佣军
They'll beat any mercenary army.

他们能打败我所见过的任何一支军队
They'll beat any army I've ever seen.

杀人对他们来说根本就不是打仗 只是消遣而已
Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.

她的龙烧毁了千辆马车
Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.

科本的弩炮射出的箭比你还大
Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.

但那也无法阻止它 何况她有三条龙
They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.

这场战争我们是赢不了的
This isn't a war we can win.

我坐在她父亲的王座上 她父亲又刚好是被你背叛 刺杀的
I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.

在她看来 她已经胜券在握
And in her mind, she's winning.

你觉得她会提出什么样的条件? 
What sort of offer do you think she'd make?

或许我们可以指望提利昂为我们求情 当做他为谋杀我们父亲和儿子的道歉
Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and son.

你看到了十字弓 你看到了父亲的尸体
You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.

我说的不是父亲
I'm not talking about Father.

提利昂没有杀乔佛里 他和这件事没有任何关系
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.

经历了这一切之后 你竟然还…
After all this time, it still amazes me that you

她死前坦白的
She confessed before she died.

是在她喝下你'好心'提供的毒药 之前还是之后? 
And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?

然后你就相信她了? 
And you believed her?

如果你是奥莲娜 你愿意看到 你的孙女嫁给乔佛里还是托曼? 
If you were Olenna, would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?

谁更容易被玛格丽掌控? 
Which one would Margaery have been better able to control?

谁更可能会让奥莲娜成为 七大王国真正的统治者? 
Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

她说的是实话
She was telling the truth.

我不该听你的
I shouldn't have listened to you.

她应该痛苦地死去
She should have died screaming.

她已经死了 就像他儿子 像她的孙辈们 她整个家族一样
She's dead, like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.

如果我们没有办法退出这场战争 我们会步他们后尘的
And if we don't find a way out of this war, we'll follow them.

所以我们要么战死 要么投降后被处死
So we fight and die or we submit and die.

而战士该明白如何选择
A soldier should know his.

它们很美 是吧? 
They're beautiful, aren't they?

我的第一反应不是这个词 不过… 不过 没错 它们很美
It wasn't the word I was thinking of, but...  but, yes, they are.

对我来说它们不是野兽
They're not beasts to me.

不管它们长到多大 或者对其他人来说有多可怕 它们都是我的孩子
No matter how big they get or how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.

你去了没多长时间
You weren't gone long.

然后 我现在的敌人已经比昨天少了
And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.

你好像心情很复杂
You're not sure how you feel about that.

你的军队消灭了多少人 才让你从波顿家族手里夺回临冬城? 
How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?

我们两个都想帮助人们
We both want to help people.

我们只能通过我们的力量来帮助他们
We can only help them from a position of strength.

有时候力量是很可怕的
Sometimes strength is terrible.

你刚到这儿的时候
When you first came here,

戴佛斯爵士说你为了你的人民 被刀子捅穿了心脏
Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.

戴佛斯爵士胡说八道呢
Ser Davos gets carried away.

所以 这是一种比喻? 
So, it was a figure of speech?

琼恩・雪诺 这是乔拉・莫尔蒙爵士 我的一位老朋友
Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.

我侍奉过您父亲
I served with your father.

如果没治好 我就不会在这儿了
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

我回来继续侍奉您 女王陛下 如果您允许的话
I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.

这是我的荣幸
It would be my honor.

我们得派遣渡鸦
We need to send ravens.

我不太相信这信上说的
I put very little stock in it myself.

末日预言从来就没有停止过 尤其是凛冬到来的时候
Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes.

有点胆怯 但头脑聪明
A little timid, but a sharp mind.

呃 北方已经让很多优秀的学士变得愚钝了
Eh, the North has dulled many good maesters' wits.

很难说是寒冷 酗酒导致的 还是被周围的人感染的
Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink, or the company.

一个瘸了腿的男孩声称看到了 长城外死人大军正在前进 是在三眼乌鸦魔力的帮助下看到的? 
A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the Wall, thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?

是的 这有点过分了
Yes, it is a bit much.

尽管如此 我们还是应该回信 布兰登・史塔克
Still, we ought to write backBrandon Stark.

瘸腿的男孩 你认识他? 
The crippled boy. Do you know him?

几年前我曾带着他穿过长城
I led him through the Wall years ago.

我看着他去了长城另一边
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

不知怎么的 一个瘸腿的男孩在长城的另一边 活了下来 而其他人却做不到
Somehow, a crippled boy survived for years beyond the Wall when no one else could.

守夜人不行 野人不行 没有人可以
Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one.

或许我们应该听听他要说什么
Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.

或许你需要做更多的抄写工作来训练你的脑子
Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.

我感觉你想给出更详细的建议? 
I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?

维斯特洛的每个人都信任并尊重你们
Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.

如果你们告诉人们这个威胁是真实的 他们就会相信
If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it.

如果你们建议所有的领主都派兵北上 守住长城 他们会照做的
If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

如果你们告诉学城的每个学士 去翻找每一本褪色的卷宗中 有关长夜的每一个字 他们或许能发现一些东西可以让我们 一劳永逸地打败亡者军团
And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the Long Night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.

这条消息有可能是真的
And this news could be authentic.

但这条消息也有可能是 龙女王的策略 用以引诱南方军队离开他们目前正在守卫的领土 好轻松征服这些领土
It's also possible that this message is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.

这种说法似乎比神奇的鸟儿与 瘸子对话更有可能啊
That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.

我们会写信给临冬城的沃肯学士 进一步确认
We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.

我向你保证 总会真相大白的
I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.

博士 求你了行了 塔利
Archmaester, pleaseThat will be all, Tarly.

这让我想起荒石城的简妮 那个骗子吹牛说自己是森林之子的血脉
It brings to mind the work of Jenny of Oldstones, the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest.

别忘了那个所谓的预言家罗德斯 那个相信淹神能崛起 摧毁征服者伊耿的
Don't forget the prophet Lodos, who promised that the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

他就是父亲和兄弟刚被活活烧死的那个? 
Is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive?

我还没忍心告诉他
I haven't had the heart to tell him yet.

上次我去看 发现鸦楼塌了
The ravenry was falling apart the last time I checked.

所有的统治者都要求人民跪地臣服
All rulers demand that people bend the knee.

所以他们才是统治者
That's why they're rulers.

她给了塔利选择的机会 一个起兵反抗她的人
She gave Tarly a choice, a man who had taken up arms against her.

她还能有什么选择
What else could she do?

不把他连同儿子一起活活烧死? 
Not burn him alive alongside his son?

我只是她的首相 无法左右她想法
I am her Hand, not her head.

我无法替她做决定
I can't make her decisions for her.

她父亲在位的时候我也常常这么对自己说
That's what I used to tell myself about her father.

我揪出叛徒 但并不是我把他们活活烧死的
I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.

我仅仅是提供情报而已
I was only a purveyor of information.

当我看到他们苦苦求饶的时候 我常常这样宽慰自己
It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy

烧他们的人不是我
I'm not the one doing it.

当他们的惨叫声越来越尖利
When the pitch of their screams rose higher

烧他们的人不是我
I'm not the one doing it.

当他们的头发着火时 当他们血肉烧焦的糊味弥漫在王座厅时
When their hair caught fire and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room

烧他们的人不是我
I'm not the one doing it.

丹妮莉丝不是她的父亲
Daenerys is not her father.

她永远不会是 只要找对了谋臣
And she never will be with the right counsel.

你必须想办法让她听进去
You need to find a way to make her listen.

那是给谁的?  琼恩・雪诺
Who's that for? Jon Snow.

封蜡上写着给北境之王
It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.

我以为艾莉亚死了
I thought Arya was dead.

我以为布兰也死了
I thought Bran was dead.

你看起来并不高兴
You don't look happy.

布兰看到夜王和他的大军 正在往东海望进军
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.

如果他们通过了长城…
If they make it past the Wall...

绝境长城已经阻挡了他们有好几千年
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years, presumably.

你说过你人手不足
You said you don't have enough men.

有多少就上多少
We'll fight with the men we have.

除非你加入我们
Unless you'll join us.

那就把国家拱手让给瑟曦吗? 
And give the country to Cersei?

我一离开她就会乘虚而入的
As soon as I march away, she marches in.

瑟曦不相信有死人军团 她认为那只是奶妈们 编出来吓唬小孩的故事
Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.

如果我们能证明她是错的呢? 
What if we prove her wrong?

我并不认为她会轻易受邀来看死人
I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.

那就把死人带去见她
So bring the dead to her.

我以为这是我们希望避免的
I thought that was what we were trying to avoid.

我们不需要整支死人军团
We don't have to bring the whole army.

我见过的第一个尸鬼 就是从长城外带到黑城堡的
The first wight I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.

抓一个这样的 把它带到君临去 向她展示真相
Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.

带任何东西都没用 除非瑟曦接见我们 而且在我们进入君临时 她能被说服 不杀我们
Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.

她唯一肯听的人就是詹姆
The only person she listens to is Jaime.

而詹姆可能会愿意听我的
He might listen to me.

而你要怎么去君临呢
And how would you get into King's Landing?

我可以把你偷偷带进去 但是如果金袍子们认出你来
I can smuggle you in, but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,

我警告你 我打仗可不行
I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

其实说什么都是白忙一场 如果我们弄不到一个这样的死人的话
Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.

那你建议我们去哪儿弄一个呢? 
How do you propose to find one?

如果女王允许的话 我会去北境设法弄一个
With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.

你曾命令我找到治疗的方法 再回到你身边服侍
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.

请让我继续服侍你
Allow me to serve you.

自由民会帮我们的
The Free Folk will help us.

他们对北境了如指掌
They know the real north better than anyone.

他们不会听命于乔拉骑士的
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

你无法在长城以北指挥突袭了
You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.

你不再是守夜人了 你是北境之王
You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North.

我是这儿唯一一个与他们战斗过的
I'm the only one here who's fought them.

我是这儿唯一了解他们的人
I'm the only one here who knows them.

但我并未许可你离开
I haven't given you permission to leave.

无意冒犯 陛下 我无需你的许可
With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.

而我来到这里 尽管知道你可能会砍我的头 或者你的龙会把我活活烧死
And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.

我相信了你 一个陌生人 因为我深知这对我的人民来说是最好的机会 对我们所有人来说都是如此
I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.

现在我也请你信任一个陌生人 因为这是我们最好的机会
Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger...  because it's our best chance.

北境之王应该留在北境
The King in the North should stay in the North.

我们并没有选你来统治我们 夫人
We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.

但是也许我们应该选你
But perhaps we should have.

谷地的骑士们为你而来 史塔克夫人
The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.

你们都太客气了 大人们
You are very kind, my lords.

他做了他认为对的事
He is doing what he thinks is best.

约恩・罗伊斯
'青铜' 符石城伯爵

我警告过琼恩也许会有这样的结果
I warned Jon this would happen.

警告他不能离开北境 指望北境跟白灵一样坐在那里乖乖等他
That he couldn't leave the North and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.

但他没有 他把北境交给你掌管
He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.

呃 他给我留的可不是什么轻松差事 北境领主们都很高傲的
Well, he's not making it easy. The Northern lords are proud.

这些是父亲和母亲的寝室
These are Mother and Father's chambers.

哪样?  有话就直说吧
What? Say what you mean.

你总是很喜欢好东西
You always liked nice things.

因为好东西会给你一种优越感
They made you feel better than everyone.

你生我的气了? 
Are you angry with me?

那些人侮辱了琼恩 可你只是坐在那儿听任他们侮辱他
They were insulting Jon, and you sat there and listened.

我只是在倾听他们的不满 这是我作为临冬城公爵夫人的责任
I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.

他们的看法对你来说很重要啊
Their opinions are important to you.

葛洛佛手下有五百人 罗伊斯有两千人
Glover has 500 men, Royce has 2,000.

要是冒犯到他们 琼恩的军队就没了
Offend them and Jon loses his army.

除非他们先没了脑袋
Not if they lose their heads first.

临冬城不是自己回到我们手里的
Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.

是我们把它夺回来的 莫尔蒙家族 霍伍德家族 野人 谷地人
We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the wildlings and the Vale.

我们一起并肩作战夺回来的
All of us, working together.

当然 我知道砍掉别人的脑袋很愉快 但是你不可能靠砍头把大家团结起来
Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.

如果琼恩回不来 你就需要这些人的支持了… 这样你们就能并肩作战 得到你真正想要的东西了
And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support...  so you can work together to give you what you really want.

你怎么会有这么可怕的想法? 
How can you even think such a horrible thing?

你现在就在这么想
You're thinking it right now.

你不愿这样 但你就是没法赶走这种想法
You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.

上次我来这儿的时候 用十字弓射死了我父亲
Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.

上次我来这儿的时候 你用野火烧死了我儿子
Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.

左边靠近山崖那里有条小路
There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.

守卫几乎不去那巡逻
The guards hardly ever patrol it.

你不留在这? 
You're not staying here?

我要去跳蚤窝办点事
I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.

要是有人把船偷走怎么办? 
What if someone takes the boat?

那我们就完蛋了 所以最好快点
Then we're fucked. Best hurry.

我们没时间练这个
We don't have time for this.

我们得预备好守城
We should be preparing the city for a siege.

多斯拉克人要来了
The Dothraki are coming.

所以你就更得训练了
All the more reason for you to train.

除非你打算跟多斯拉克的小屁孩打
Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12yearolds.

呵 我记得他们好像也把你打得够呛
Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.

所以我来了 准备训练
And here I am, ready to train.

因为我觉得你不希望人们看见 你是怎么挥那把破剑的
I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.

说不定今天就是我不小心干掉你的日子呢
Today might be the day I kill you by accident.

哦 你不会对我动手的
Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

你们 慢慢聊吧
I'll leave you to it.

但我知道你肯定不会同意
And I knew you'd never agree to meet.

跟你一比我就像个傻子
You made me look like a complete fool.

我以为攻打凯岩城能出乎你的意料 但你却先我一步
I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.

抛下家族领地 真是冷静理智啊
Abandoned the family home, completely unsentimental.

父亲若泉下有知一定会很骄傲
Father would have been proud.

别跟我提父亲 听我说…
Don't talk about Father. Listen to me

我曾经告诉过波隆 我要是再遇到你 就把你砍成两半
I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half.

用训练剑的话 你可得多花些工夫了
It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.

他打算把我处刑啊
He was going to execute me.

他知道我是无辜的
He knew I was innocent.

他恨我不是因为我的所作所为 他恨我是因为我的模样
He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.

一个上天派来惩罚他的小怪物
A little monster sent to punish him.

他…  他觉得… 他觉得我希望生来如此吗? 
Did hedid he think did he think I wanted to be born this way?

他觉得这是我选择的…  你到底想怎样? !
Did he think I chose itWhat do you want?!

丹妮莉丝会赢下这场战争
Daenerys will win this war.

你是个带兵打仗的人
You're a military man.

你知道这无法避免
You must know there's no way around that.

丹妮莉丝和她父亲不一样
Daenerys is not her father.

她甚至愿意休战 只要瑟曦同意一些条件
She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

你要是想让瑟曦下跪 你大可自己去跟她说
If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.

我…  我不想 丹妮莉丝也不这样想
II don't. And Daenerys doesn't.

至少暂时如此
Not right now, anyway.

她有更重要的请求
She has a more important request.

我本来不确定能否找到你
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

我以为你还在划船呢
Thought you might still be rowing.

小店 酒馆 妓院 我都去看过了
I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.

然而本就应当直接来钢铁街找的
Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.

你就不怕金袍子? 
Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?

几年没来这儿了
Haven't been here in years.

他们怎么会认得我呢? 
Why should they recognize me?

有的时候我自己都认不出自己
Sometimes I hardly do.

时间是把杀猪刀啊
Nothing fucks you harder than time.

有人找你麻烦吗? 
Anybody give you any trouble?

我在这儿 给兰尼斯特家打造兵器 却从没有人多看我一眼
Here I am, arming Lannisters, and I never get a second look.

对我来说最安全的地方是女王眼皮子底下
Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.

安全从来不会长久
Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.

不好的东西就要来了
Bad things are coming.

你是来接我的 你想让我跟你走
You came to get me. You want me to come with you.

呃 你得明白…  我准备好了
Well, the thing you need to understand isI'm ready.

你得搞清楚你要去的是个什么地方
You should know what you're heading into.

你觉得我每次挥动锤子的时候 都在想些什么? 
What do you think I've been thinking about with every swing of the hammer?

为杀死我父亲的家族打造武器 心里是多么愉快? 
How happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?

而且这个家族还正是 企图杀掉我的那个? 
The family that tried to kill me?

我一直都在做准备
I've been getting ready.

我不知道为了什么 但我明白 当时机到来的时候我就会知道了
I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.

你可能得从这里面挑一把剑
You might want to bring one of those swords.

我不怎么会使剑
I don't know much about swinging swords.

但这个… 我知道怎么用
But this...  this I know.

别跟其他人透露你父亲的名字
Keep your father's name to yourself.

情况已经够复杂的了
Situation's complicated enough already.

好 那我该说自己是谁? 
Well, who should I say I am?

我告诉你了 克洛维斯 再不赶快离开这儿 有人就…  喂! 你俩!
I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon, someone's going toYou there!

没带武器 朋友们 我发誓
No weapons, friends. I promise.

我能为你们做些什么? 
What can I do for you?

那是你的船?  对
Is that your boat? It is.

可码头在那边 对
The docks are that way. That they are.

我没在那边上岸 就是为了避免和你们这些好老爷打照面
I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.

还是五个金龙?  你在开玩笑吗? 
Still five gold dragons? Are you joking?

你比看起来要老多了
You must be even older than you look.

你们真是做生意的好手
I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.

我好这口 火腿也不错
I like wine. Or hams.

腌蟹肉 什么? 
Fermented crab. What?

一桶这玩意儿能顶一家妓院一周收入的三倍呢
One bucket of this triples a brothel's earnings for the week.

嫖客完事儿了
A man thinks he's done.

准备回家和亲爱的家人团聚
He's ready to go back to his loving family.

但在他套上裤子之前 刚刚的姐们儿舀了一小勺这玩意儿送进他嘴里
But before he gets his breeches up, his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.

五分钟后 那家伙又重振雄风
Five minutes later, he's back in the race.

得快点让你们尝到好味道 要不然你们可要在我身上开个洞了
I'd hurry to your favorite establishment, or you'll put a hole in that chainmail.

在第一口美味生效之前 我真的不会再给了
I really wouldn't try any more until you see how the first bite hits you.

你的伤疤是怎么来的? 
Where'd you get that scar?

鱼钩刮的 有些人就是怎么都教不会
Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.

不久前我们在找带着同样伤的侏儒
We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back.

老爷们 咱们再商量商量? 
Perhaps there's some arrangement?

那你要比瑟曦女王给得更多…
You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei

我再给您些其他的
I could give you something.

不必了
That won't be necessary.

他是女王之手 你又为什么来这儿? 
He's the Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?

我们的弟弟有什么要说? 
What did our brother have to say?

丹妮莉丝想要和我们见面
Daenerys wants to meet.

讨论她的投降事宜? 
To discuss her surrender?

不 是为了讨论休战事宜
To discuss an armistice.

她可是刚刚取得了一场大胜 为什么想休战? 
She's just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?

因为一支死人大军 正朝七国而来
Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.

提利昂说他有证据
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

你会惩罚他么?  提利昂? 
Are you going to punish him? Tyrion?

在你不知情且未同意的情况下安排你和提利昂见面
He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.

你觉得发生在城里的重要事情 有我不知道的吗? 
Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?

你任由这一切发生 为什么? 
You let it happen. Why?

我相信 与龙女王的和解 对我们当下可能有利
I've come to believe that an accommodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.

若想打败她 我们需要明智的对策
If we want to beat her, we have to be clever.

得像父亲那样作战
We have to fight her like Father would have.

死人大军 龙 龙女王
Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens...

无论面前的敌人为何 我们一定能击败他们
Whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it.

为了我们 为了家族 为了这个孩子
For ourselves, for our house, for this.

那孩子的父亲是? 
Who will you say is the father?

民众是不会赞同的
People won't like that.

还记得父亲常说的吗? 
Do you remember what Father used to say about people?

雄狮无所顾忌羔羊的想法
The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

别再背叛我了
Never betray me again.

国王要考虑的够多了 我知道
The king's got a lot on his mind. I understand.

别让他为了一个死掉的国王的私生子分忧
He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.

这点我明白 你仅仅是克洛维斯 一个在启程前往临冬城铁匠铺工作之前 来拜候国王的小铁匠
You don't have to worry. You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.

不好意思打扰了 陛下
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

你从君临活着回来了
You survived King's Landing.

不是第一次了 陛下 这位是克洛…
Yet again. Your Grace, this is Clo

我叫詹德利 陛下
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

我是劳勃・拜拉席恩的儿子
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

他本该保密的 不让其他人知道
He was meant to keep that to himself.

我们的父亲彼此信任
Our fathers trusted each other.

我曾在临冬城见过你父亲一面
I saw your father once at Winterfell.

我在铺子里见过您的父亲
I met yours in my shop.

你比我想象中瘦 而您比我想象中矮
You're a lot leaner. And you're a lot shorter.

我是听着他们的故事长大的
I grew up on stories about them.

我只知道他们并肩作战且赢下了战争
All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.

戴佛斯爵士和我说了陛下您要去的地方 以及原因
Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.

请让我与您同行
Let me come with you.

别犯傻 你又不是士兵
Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.

对 可我是个战士
No, but I'm a fighter.

他不需要一个佩剑的铁匠
And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.

你会用剑吗? 
You know how to use one?

这倒是个问题
Well, that's a problem.

他能照料好自己
He can handle himself.

我们能用得上他
We could use the help.

我父亲曾说
As my father used to say,

'做一瞬的懦夫 胜过做一辈子的死者'
'It's better to be a coward for a minute, than dead for the rest of your life.'

如果那里发生的一切真的如你所说
But if what you said is true about what's up there,

我真的等不及要开战了
I can't wait out this war.

好啊 没人顾及我的想法
Yeah, nobody mind me.

我只是想长命百岁
All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.

说出来你可能不信 但我真的挺想你的 莫尔蒙
You may not believe it, but I've missed you, Mormont.

你瞪人比谁都凶
Nobody glowers quite like you.

这是奴隶主给我的硬币 当时我让他放了我们然后给咱们钱 记得吗
This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?

那本该是让我们续命用的
It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.

我们现在该说再见了
We should be better at saying farewell by now.

假如我没能回来 至少你不用 再纠结北境之王这人了
If I don't return, at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.

我已经习惯了有他
I've grown used to him.

陛下 祝您武运昌隆
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.

你知道学城里有多少台阶吗? 
Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?

那你猜贝勒大圣堂有多少窗户
Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.

这位总主教梅纳德 他什么都记
This High Septon Maynard, he recorded everything.

连自己的大小便他都记
He even recorded his own bowel movements.

'休妻'是什么意思? 
What does 'annulment' mean?

就是一个男人抛弃他的合法妻子
It's when a man sets aside his lawful wife.

梅纳德这里写说 他公布了一位'雷嘎'王子的休妻行为 并且让他在同一时间和别人再婚 在多恩给他俩举办了秘密婚礼
Maynard says here that he issued an annulment for a Prince 'Ragger' and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

这在南方是件平常事吗还是… ? 
Is that a common thing in the south or?

这些学士・・・ 他们总是让我去记录保存那人数出来的窗户数量 还有什么休妻还有他拉的那些屎 而击败夜王的秘密 可能还置放在某个尘封的书架上 完全被忽视了
These maesters...  they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity, while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere, completely ignored.

反正又无所谓 是吧? 
But that's all right, isn't it?

反正我们都会变成被束缚着的奴隶 头脑简单四肢发达 受制于邪恶的化身 只要我们能知道总主教梅纳德 记录的全部 15782 句屁话!
We can all become slavering, murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Maynard's 15,782 shits!

是台阶的数量
That number was the steps.

你确定你要这么做吗? 
Are you sure you want to do this?

你可是一直想当学士
You always wanted to be a maester.

我已经疲于了解伟人的成就了
I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.

这 呃 花了点时间
It, uh, took some searching.

鲁温学士的档案都非常全面
Maester Luwin's archives are very thorough.

你确定这是临冬城里唯一的副本? 
You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?

史塔克小姐感谢您的效劳
Lady Stark thanks you for your service.

说服他放弃这种傻逼念头 这难道不是你的任务吗? 
Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?

我最近这项任务做失败了
I've been failing at that job of late.

现在有多少女王? 
How many queens are there now?

那你是要去说服有龙的那位 还是跟她弟乱伦的那位? 
And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?

你带来多少兵力? 
How many men did you bring?

我们希望你们的人能帮忙
We were hoping some of your men could help.

嗯 我会留下来的
Hmm. I'll be staying behind.

我是个有责任感的人 你懂的
I'm a liability out there, as you well know.

你真的想去那里? 再去一次? 
You really want to go out there? Again?

你不是一个人
You're not the only ones.

我的探子在长城南面一里处发现了他们
My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.

说他们正往这儿来
Said they were on their way here.

我在临冬城见过你
I saw you once at Winterfell.

他们也想出长城
They want to go beyond the Wall, too.

我们不是想出长城 我们是必须出长城
We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.

我们的神告诉我们一场大战即将来临…
Our Lord told us that the Great War is coming

别信他们任何一人
Don't trust any of them.

他们是兄弟会的
They're the Brotherhood.

他们的神让他们做的最后一件事 就是把我卖给红女巫杀掉
And the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.

我差点认不出你了
I hardly recognized you.

在这里他们什么都不给喝
They won't give me anything to drink down here.

我都觉得不是自己了
I haven't been feeling like myself.

你就是那个该死的莫尔蒙? 
You're a fucking Mormont?

上一任守夜人总司令? 
Like the last Lord Commander?

他像狩猎一样猎杀我们
He hunted us like animals.

你还了我人情 我记得
You returned the favor, as I recall.

现在我们都在这儿了 在世界边缘 同一时刻 为了同一个目标往同一个方向迈进
Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment, heading in the same direction for the same reason.

我们的目标不是你们的
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

我们的目标是什么又无关紧要
It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.

还有个更伟大的目标
There's a greater purpose at work.

我们要一起完成 不管我们是否意识到这点
And we serve it together, whether we know it or not.

我们或许会采取步骤 但光之王…
We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light

看在他妈的份上 你能夹上屁眼吗? 
For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?

你们到底要不要带上我们一起? 
Are we coming with you or not?

你不先问问我们打算做什么吗? 
Don't you want to know what we're doing?

难道这比在冰冷的囚牢里坐吃等死还惨吗? 
Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell, waiting to die?

我们都是一条绳上的蚂蚱
We're all on the same side.

最重要的也是唯一的敌人
The first enemy and the last.

虽然敌人总是赢
The enemy always wins.

但我们还是得不依不挠地反抗他们
And we still need to fight him.

你害怕了 对吧? 
You're scared, aren't you?

你在怕什么? 
What are you scared of?

詹德利
'大牛' 劳勃的私生子

从没来过北方? 
Ever been north before?

从没见过雪
Never seen snow before.

南方的空气闻着像猪屎
Down south, the air smells like pig shit.

你根本没去过南方
You've never been down south.

我去过临冬城 那还是北境
I've been to Winterfell. That's the North.

你是怎么在这活下去的? 
How do you live up here?

有什么方法让命根子不被冻掉? 
How do you keep your balls from freezing off?

秘诀就是你得一直活动
You got to keep moving. That's the secret.

走路很好, 打仗更好, 能操最好
Walking's good, fighting's better, fucking's best.

这儿方圆百里都不会有一个喘气的女人
There's not a living woman within a hundred miles of here.

手上有啥就凑合用吧
We have to make do with what we've got.

这小子可能不怎么聪明
This one is maybe not so smart.

戴佛斯说他是个很强的战士
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

很好, 这比聪不聪明更重要
Good. That's more important than being smart.

聪明人可不会跑来这找尸鬼
Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.

那么, 你已经见过了龙女王, 嗯? 
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

除非我跪地称臣她才肯和我们联手
She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.

你和自由民相处太久了
You spent too much time with the Free Folk.

现在也不喜欢下跪了
Now you don't like kneeling.

曼斯·雷德是一个勇敢的人
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

塞外之王绝不屈膝
The KingbeyondtheWall never bent the knee.

他的尊严葬送了多少人? 
How many of his people died for his pride?

小子, 你还在生我们的气? 
You still mad at us, boy?

你们把我卖给了女巫
You sold me to a witch.

我得说, 这之间有细微的差别
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

我们正身处一场大战当中 打仗就要费钱
We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.

我想成为你们的一员
I wanted to be one of you.

我想加入兄弟会, 但你们却把我卖了 像奴隶一样
I wanted to join the Brotherhood, but you sold me off like a slave.

你们知道她对我做了什么吗? 
Do you know what she did to me?

她把我推倒在床 扒光我的衣服…  目前听起来还不错啊
She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked... Sounds all right so far.

然后把水蛭放我身上… 她也裸着呢? 
...and put leeches on me. Was she naked, too?

她想要你的血
She needed your blood.

对, 谢谢   这我知道
Yes, thank you. I know that.

还不算太糟 她想要杀了我
Could have been worse. She wanted to kill me!

多亏了戴佛斯, 不然他们就把我杀了  但他们没做到 不是吗? 
They would have killed me if wasn't for Davos. But they didn't, did they?

那你还发什么牢骚? 
So, what you whinging about?

你嘴唇在动 在抱怨着些什么
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

这家伙被杀死了六次
This one's been killed six times.

也没听到他抱怨一句屁话
You don't hear him bitching about it.

我第一次到长城以北是跟你父亲一起
The first time I went north of the Wall was with your father.

他值得有个好儿子
He deserved a better son.

他临终时你在他身边吗? 
Were you with him at the end?

我当时是野人的囚犯
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

我想让你知道
I want you to know that.

每个叛徒都会受到裁决
Every mutineer found justice.

我想不出对他来说比这更残忍的死法
Can't think of a worse way for him to go.

守夜人就是他的生命
The Night's Watch was his life.

他会誓死来保护每一个人守夜人
He would have died to protect every one of those men.

但他们却虐杀了他
And they butchered him.

我也痛恨他以这方式死去
I hate that he died that way.

我父亲是我见过最受人尊敬的人
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.

他至始至终都是个好人
He was good all the way through.

最后却死在了刽子手的断头台上
And he died on the executioner's block.

你父亲曾经想处决我 知道吗? 
Your father wanted to execute me, you know?

他当然是站在公正的立场上
He was in the right, of course.

也丝毫没有减轻当时我对他的恨意
Didn't make me hate him any less.

我很高兴他没有抓到你 我也是
I'm glad he didn't catch you. Me, too.

你的父亲给了我这把剑
Your father gave me this sword.

把剑柄头从熊改成了狼… 但它依旧是长爪
Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf...  but it's still Longclaw.

莫尔蒙总司令 以为你再也不会回到维斯特洛
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.

但你回来了 而这把剑在你的家族传承了数百年
But you are back, and it's been in your family for centuries.

我还拿着它就不合适了
It's not right for me to have it.

我使我的家族蒙羞
I brought shame onto my house.

我伤透了父亲的心
I broke my father's heart.

我早已丧失持有这把剑的权利
I forfeited the right to claim this sword.

希望它能为你… 以及你的子孙所用
May it serve you well...  and your children after you.

父亲过去经常从这上面看着我们
Father used to watch us from up here.

他不怎么说话
He wouldn't say much.

你可能不记得了
You probably don't remember.

你总是在屋里做针线活
You were inside knitting all the time.

有次男孩们在和罗德利克爵士射箭
One time, the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrik.

他们走后我来了这儿 正好布兰把弓给落下了 扔在地上
I came out here after, and Bran had left his bow behind, just lying on the ground.

要是罗德利克爵士看到了一定会打他
Ser Rodrik would have cuffed him if he saw.

还有一支箭在靶子上
There was one arrow in the target.

周围一个人都没有 就像现在
There was no one around, just like now.

于是我开始射箭
So I started shooting.

每射一箭我都要上去 把我唯一的箭取下来 然后走回去继续射
And every shot, I had to go up there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.

终于, 我射中了靶心
Finally, I hit the bull'seye.

也许是第 20 箭, 或者第 50 箭
Could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.

但我射中了靶心, 接着我就听到了这个
But I hit the bull'seye, and I heard this.

我抬起头 他就站在这里 对着我微笑
I looked up, and he's standing right here, smiling down at me.

我知道我的所作所为不合规矩
I knew what I was doing was against the rules.

但他却在微笑 所以我知道我没做错
But he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong.

错的是规矩
The rules were wrong.

他很明白我所做的正是我注定要做的
I was doing what I was meant to be doing, and he knew it.

做了兰尼斯特的刀下鬼 其中还有你的推波助澜
Killed by the Lannisters with your help.

这上面是你的漂亮字迹
That's your pretty handwriting.

当初茉丹修女弄伤我的手指关节
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

就因为我写不出你那样的一手好字
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

'罗柏 我怀着沉重的心情给你写信
'Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.

我们的好国王劳勃驾崩了 他在猎捕野猪时受伤而死'
Our good King Robert is dead, killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt.'

你没有必要读出来 我都记得
You don't have to read it. I remember.

'父亲被控告以叛国罪
'Father has been charged with treason.

他与劳勃的弟弟一起蓄意谋反 要偷走我挚爱的乔佛里的王位
He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.

兰尼斯特家族善待我 并给予我慰问与关心
The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.

我请求你 速至君临 发誓效忠于乔佛里国王 并防止兰尼斯特家族和史塔克家族之间 发生任何冲突
I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey, and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.

你亲爱的妹妹 珊莎'
Your faithful sister, Sansa.'

他们强迫我这么写的
They forced me to do it.

拿刀抵着你的喉咙? 
With a knife at your throat?

他们有没有把你放上拷刑架 扯碎你的骨头? 
Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?

你不清楚当时的情况 我不过是个孩子
You don't know what it was like. I was a child.

我也是 可我就算让他们杀掉也不愿背叛我的家族
So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.

他们告诉我 这是救父亲的唯一方法
They told me it was the only way to save Father.

那你就能够蠢到去相信他们
And you were stupid enough to believe them.

我还记得你与乔佛里和瑟曦一起站在高台上 而父亲则被拉扯上断头台
I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged Father to the block.

我还记得你的漂亮裙子
I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.

还记得你头上华丽的发式
I remember the fancy way you did your hair.

站在贝勒雕像附近的人群里
Standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.

你有去营救父亲吗? 
Did you come running to the rescue?

你有和兰尼斯特家的人决一死战 救出父亲吗? 
Did you fight off the Lannisters and save Father?

我想这么做 可你没有 就像我一样
I wanted to. But you didn't, just like me.

我没有背叛他 我没有背叛罗柏
I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb.

我没有为了我挚爱的乔佛里背叛整个家族
I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.

你本该跪在我的面前感谢我
You should be on your knees, thanking me.

我们现在还能重新站在临冬城 是因为我
We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.

赢回临冬城的不是你 不是琼恩
You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back.

他输掉了私生子之战
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

赢得这场战役的是谷地骑士 他们为了我才会策马北上
The Knights of the Vale won the battle, and they rode north for me.

而你在哪里? 周游世界? 
While you were off, where? Traveling the world?

我在训练 训练
I was training. Training.

那好 在你训练的同时
Well, while you were training,

我经历着你所无法想象的折磨
I suffered things you could never imagine.

哦 我是不知道那些 但我的想象力很丰富
Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.

你绝不可能在我当初的境遇下存活
You never would have survived what I survived.

那谁知道呢
I guess we'll never know.

你要如何处置那封信? 
What are you going to do with that letter?

你把这封信拿给谁看了? 你是从哪里拿到的这封信? 
Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?

你怕了 是不是? 
You're scared, aren't you?

你在怕什么? 
What are you scared of?

如果你没犯下什么罪过
You didn't commit any crimes.

没人会将你处以绞刑   够了, 艾丽娅…
No one's going to hang you. Well, Arya...

你害怕我拿给琼恩看, 他会勃然大怒
You're scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry.

不, 琼恩才不会这样, 他会理解你
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

你当时不过是个担惊受怕的小姑娘 孤零零的, 落在邪恶的兰尼斯特家族手里
You were just a scared little girl, all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

你知道如果瑟曦看到我们像这样内斗 她该有多开心吗? 
Do you know how happy Cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting?

这就是她想看到的
This is exactly what she wants.

她所梦寐以求的…  离间我们
This is what she's always wanted... to tear us apart.

你怕北境诸侯看到这封信
You're scared the Northern lords will read it.

要是让他们知道珊莎小姐曾对瑟曦言听计从 他们肯定不会把你放在眼里
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.

想想小莱安娜·莫尔蒙会怎么说? 
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

她比你写这封劝降信时的年纪还小
She's younger than you were when you wrote this.

你还能说'那时我不过是个孩子'吗? 
Are you going to say, 'But I was just a child?'

有些时候愤怒会让人们做出不明智的事情
Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.

有些时候恐惧会让人们做出不明智的事情
Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.

你就是他们叫的那个狗子
You're the one they call 'the Dog.'

他们告诉我说你很刻薄
They told me you were mean.

你是生下来就刻薄 还是你就是讨厌野人? 
Were you born mean or you just hate wildings?

我他妈才不在乎什么野人
I don't give two shits about wildings.

红毛多好看
Gingers are beautiful.

我们被火焰亲吻过 就像你一样
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

别他妈用手指我
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

你还是娃娃的时候摔到火坑里了? 
Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?

不是摔的, 我是被推的
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

从那之后, 你就变得刻薄了
And ever since, you've been mean.

我不觉得你是真刻薄
I don't think you're truly mean.

你想吸我的屌 是不是? 
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

不, 我更喜欢小妹妹
Nope, it's pussy for me.

还有个美人在临冬城等着我呢
I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.

如果我还回得去的话
If I ever get back there.

黄头发 蓝眼睛 你见过的最高的女人
Yellow hair, blue eyes, the tallest woman you've ever seen.

几乎和你一样高
Almost as tall as you.

塔斯的布蕾妮?  你认识她? 
Brienne of Tarth. You know her?

你跟他妈的塔斯的布蕾妮在一起? 
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

呃 还没在一起呢
Well, not with her yet.

但我注意到她瞅我的眼神 她怎么瞅你的? 
But I see the way she looks at me. How does she look at you?

像是要把你大卸八块把肝挖出来吃了吗? 
Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?

我想和她生孩子
I want to make babies with her.

想象一下… 高大壮实的怪胎们
Think of them... great big monsters.

可以征服世界
They'd conquer the world.

像你这样又疯又混账的人怎么还活了这么久? 
How did a mad fucker like you live this long?

我杀人很顺手
I'm good at killing people.

你不像他
You don't look much like him.

我猜你更像你母亲
I suppose you favor your mother.

他还是国王之手的时候 曾派我征剿魔山
When he was Hand, he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

你手下的野人告诉我 你被红袍女复活了
Your wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.

索罗斯也把我复活了六次
Thoros has brought me back six times.

我们都侍奉同一位神
We both serve the same lord.

北境可没有让你死而复生
The North didn't raise you from the dead.

光之王从没给过我什么指引
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

我对他一无所知
I don't know anything about him.

我不知道他想从我这里得到点什么
I don't know what he wants from me.

他想要你活着   为什么? 
He wants you alive. Why?

任何人都可以这么对我说… '我不知道'
That's all anyone can tell me... 'I don't know.'

既然我们都不知道神想要什么 那侍奉神明的意义又是什么? 
So, what's the point in serving a god if none of us knows what he wants?

我一直都在思考这个问题
I think about that all the time.

我认为我们也不必追根求底
I don't think it's our purpose to understand.

除了一件事… 我们是战士
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

我们必须清楚为了什么而战
We have to know what we're fighting for.

我不是为了那些我压根不认识 坐在铁王座上的男人或女人而战
I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.

那你是为了什么而战? 
So, what are you fighting for?

最初也是最后的敌人
The first enemy and the last.

敌人一直都胜券在手
The enemy always wins.

但我们依旧奋战如初
And we still need to fight him.

在这里你我都不会有太多乐子 但我们能保卫生命
You and I won't find much joy while we're here, but we can keep others alive.

保护那些没能力保护自己的人
We can defend those who can't defend themselves.

也许我们不需要理解更多意义了
Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.

那就是我在火里看到过的东西
That's what I saw in the fire.

一座像箭头一样的山
A mountain like an arrowhead.

你知道我为什么欣赏你吗? 
Do you know what I like about you?

说实话我不知道 你不是英雄
I honestly don't. You're not a hero.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'龙之母' 龙石岛的女王

我也偶尔英雄过
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

比如率军冲过君临的烂泥门…
I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing and...

我不想你成为一位英雄
I don't want you to be a hero.

英雄们总做蠢事送命
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

卓戈, 乔拉, 达里奥 甚至这个… 琼恩·雪诺… 他们都争先恐后
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this... Jon Snow...  they all try to outdo each other.

做些愚蠢至极而又无畏的事
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

有意思的是 那些您提到的英雄…
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

卓戈, 乔拉, 达里奥 甚至这个… 琼恩·雪诺…
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this... Jon Snow.

他们全都倾心于您
They all fell in love with you.

琼恩·雪诺才没有对我动心   哦 我搞错了
Jon Snow's not in love with me. Oh, my mistake.

以为他那么渴望地盯着您 是想求得一次成功的军事联姻
I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.

他太矮了
He's too little for me.

就英雄来说他确实挺矮
As heroes go, he is quite little.

我不会选一位懦夫当我的女王之手
I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.

所以, 如果进展顺利
So, if all goes well,

我最后会见到你姐姐
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

根据你告诉过我的她的'事迹' 恐怕她会谋杀我而不是谈判
From everything you've told me about her, she'd rather murder me than speak with me.

事实上… 她会先惨无人道地折磨您 然后再把您杀掉
Oh, first, she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you.

没人比我更不信任我姐了, 所以相信我
Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.

但如果我们前往都城 我们会带着两支军队, 以及三头巨龙
But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons.

一旦有人敢碰您, 君临城顷刻间就会陷于火海化为乌有
Anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stones.

她现在正想着如何设下圈套
And right now, she's thinking of how to set a trap.

而她也在想你会搞什么陷阱
And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.

如果我们想要创造一个美好崭新的世界
If we want to create a new and better world,

我并不确定欺骗与屠杀是开始这一切的上策
I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.

哪次战争胜利的背后没有诡计与屠杀? 
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?

没错 赢得王座 是要冷酷无情
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne.

您需要引起一定程度的恐惧
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

但恐惧是瑟曦唯一的武器
But fear is all Cersei has.

我父亲也是如此… 还有乔佛里
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

他们的权力因此而脆弱 因为他们统治之下的每个人都迫切希望他们去死
It makes their power brittle because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.

伊耿·坦格利安依靠恐惧统治了很久
Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.

但您曾对我说你要打破旧规
But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel.

如果您想当那样的女王 您和之前的暴君又有何区别? 
If that's the kind of queen you want to be, how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?

所以我们要走进狮穴
So we walk into the lions' den.

我哥哥向我保证 他会管好兰尼斯特军队
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.

抱歉 我可不信任何兰尼斯特的承诺
Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.

不会让您冲动行事
I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.

这次谈判会很艰难
This will be a difficult negotiation.

我们对面坐着的是不共戴天之人
We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless.

我姐姐很可能会说些激怒您的话
My sister is likely to say something provocative.

那又怎么样? 而大家都知道 您经常发怒 像所有伟大的领袖一样
And? And you have been known to lose your temper from time to time, as all great leaders do.

我什么时候发怒了? 
When have I lost my temper?

比如说烧死塔利父子时
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

那不是冲动
That was not impulsive.

也许您只用处死父亲 不用处死儿子
Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.

也许他们都需要在孤独冰冷的牢房里 反思自己的过错
Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate their mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell.

我们还没来得及讨论这些可能性 您就把它们全部推翻了
We had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities.

听上去在这场争论中 你站在自己家族那边
One could be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.

我确实站在那边
I am taking their side.

您必须站在敌人的角度 才能用他们的眼光看事情
You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do.

而您只有用他们的眼光看事情 才能预测他们的行动 有效的应对 打败他们
And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively, and beat them.

我很希望您能这样做
Which I want you to do very much.

因为我对您和您想建立的世界都怀有信心
Because I believe in you and in the world you want to build.

但那样的世界 不是一夜之间就能建成的
But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once.

也许终极一生都无法完成
Probably not in a single lifetime.

我们怎么确保您的愿景能持续下去? 
How do we ensure that your vision endures?

打破旧规之后 我们怎样么确保它不死灰复燃? 
After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?

你想知道我死之后谁坐铁王座
You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead.

您说您不能生育了 但也有其他方式选继承人
You say you can't have children, but there are other ways of choosing a successor.

守夜人有一种办法
The Night's Watch has one method.

铁民们 他们虽然缺点很多 但也有一种办法
The ironborn, for all their many flaws, have another.

在我赢得王位之后再谈继承之事
We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.

陛下, 您在黑水河作战时 我看到成百支箭向您飞来 也看到它们都未中的
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on the Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

但如果有一支箭正中您心脏, 让您…
But any one of them could have found your heart and ended your...

你最近对我的死考虑了很多啊, 是不是? 
You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?

这是你和你哥哥 在君临讨论的问题之一吗? 
Is this one of the items you discussed with your brother in King's Landing?

为了侍奉您, 我在长远考虑
I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.

也许如果你眼光放短些 我们就不会失去多恩和高庭
Perhaps if you planned for the short term, we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.

在我赢得王位以后再讨论继承之事
We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.

熊都是蓝眼睛的吗? 
Do bears have blue eyes?

咱们得把他带回东海望
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

被尸鬼熊咬了而已
I just got bit by a dead bear.

她从哪拿到这信的? 我不知道
Where did she get it? I don't know.

她好像很神通广大
She seems very resourceful.

我们要让两万人 在他们见过的最可怕的冬天里和我们共同作战
We're asking 20,000 men to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen.

天气还不是最严重的问题
The weather will be the least of their problems.

很多人都想找个好借口回家
Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.

你怀疑他们的忠心? 他们是向琼恩效忠的
You question their loyalty? Their loyalty is to Jon.

琼恩不在这里 我几周没收到他来信了
Jon is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.

你是临冬城公爵夫人
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

北境之王命你在他离开时代掌朝政
The king chose you to rule in his absence.

他们看得见, 尊重你
They see that. They respect you.

甚至可能有些人更支持你执政
Some may even prefer you.

对, 他们背叛了琼恩 就在收复临冬城的时候 然后又拥他为王 现在他们又想再次背叛他
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon when it was time to retake Winterfell, then they named him their king, and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again.

对这种人, 你敢付出多少信任? 
How far would you trust men like that?

一群墙头草
They're all bloody wind vanes.

如果他们发现我写了那封信 更何况我曾不止一次, 而是两次嫁给家族的敌人…
If they found out that I wrote that letter, a woman who's already married not one, but two enemies of her house...

等到琼恩归来, 恐怕已经没有士兵追随他了
By the time Jon comes back, he'll have no army left.

艾莉亚和他们不一样
Arya's not like them.

你们或许会有分歧 但她永远不会背叛亲人
You may have disagreements, but she would never betray her family.

她会的, 如果她觉得我会背叛琼恩
She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.

她真这么觉得? 
Is that what she thinks?

我也不知道她究竟会怎么想
I don't know what she thinks.

她已经不是我认识的那个艾莉亚了
I don't know her anymore.

布蕾妮小姐或许能帮你
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

她发过誓会保护凯特琳·史塔克的两个女儿 不是吗? 
She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls, is she not?

所以无论你们两个谁想要以任何方式伤害对方 她都会恪守誓言来阻止这一切, 对吧? 
And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way, wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?

有件事我一直想问你   问吧
Something I've always wanted to know. All right.

你率兵进攻派克城的时候究竟喝了多少酒? 
How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?

老实说, 我压根不记得怎么进攻的
If I'm being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach.

是几个兄弟第二天早上告诉我的
Some of the lads told me about it the next morning.

听起来是喝了不少
Sounded like a good scrap.

你那会儿喝得刚刚好
It was a proper scrap.

铁民以为你是某个神 你当时挥舞着那把燃烧的剑
The ironborn thought you were some kind of god, the way you were waving that flaming sword.

那会儿我觉得你是我见过的最厉害的人
I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.

剩下的在哪里? 
Where's the rest of them?

如果一直等下去 我们就能知道了
If we wait long enough, we'll find out.

快回东海望!
Run back to Eastwatch.

马上派渡鸦给丹妮莉丝送信 告诉她发生了什么
Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.

我不会抛下你们的   你跑得最快! 走! 快走!
I'm not leaving you. You're the fastest. Go, now.

不拿锤子你跑得更快 给我!
You're faster without the hammer. Give it.

其他人呢? 
Where are the others?

渡鸦 让渡鸦送信
Raven, we need to send a raven.

去叫学士! 快去!
Get the maester, now!

要我说, 这种死法还不错
They say it's one of the better ways to go.

光之王, 请为我们引路
Lord of Light, show us the way.

请降临于人世的黑暗之中 带领您的信徒重归光明
Come to us in our darkness and lead Your servant into the light.

我们得把他的尸体烧了
We have to burn his body.

除非你要光之王发发善心 给我们一点火种, 不然我们都得像他这样
We'll all be close behind him unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.

光之王 请降临于人世的黑暗之中 因为长夜漫漫 处处险恶
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness, for the night is dark and full of terrors.

很快 我们都会冻僵的
We'll all freeze soon.

湖面也快冻住了
And so will the water.

你杀死异鬼的时候 后面跟着的死尸也全都倒下了
When you killed the white walker, almost all the dead that followed it fell.

或许就是他制造了那些尸鬼
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

我们可以和异鬼一斗
We can go for the walkers.

说不定我们有机会赢   不
Maybe we'll stand a chance. No.

我们要做的是把那玩意带回去
We need to take that thing back with us.

我们已经派出渡鸦去给龙石岛送信了
There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.

丹妮莉丝才是我们唯一的机会
Daenerys is our only chance.

你不明白
You don't understand.

光之王复活了你
The Lord brought you back.

就我们俩 别无他人
No one else. Just us.

难道他复活我们只是为了眼看着我们冻死? 
Did He do it to watch us freeze to death?

当心点儿, 贝里, 你的祭司已经死了
Careful, Beric. You lost your priest.

你就剩这一条命了
This is your last life.

我等着与死亡交手, 已经很久了
I've been waiting for the end for a long time.

或许光之王带我来这里, 就是为了遇见死亡
Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.

我见过的每个神都是贱人
Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.

我不觉得光之王会是个例外
Don't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.

这是一封请柬 请我去君临
It's an invitation to King's Landing.

小姐, 您才是临冬城的女主人
My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.

我知道, 你将代表我去参加他们那个聚会
I am, and you will represent my interests at this gathering as you see them.

他们邀请的是您, 他们希望见到的也是您
They invited you. They want you there.

只要瑟曦还是女王, 我就不会踏进君临一步
I will not set foot in King's Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen.

他们要是想再囚禁一个史塔克 尽管来这里抓我
If they want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me.

不然我哪儿都不会去
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

我还有很多事要处理
I have work to do here.

詹姆爵士会在那儿的
Ser Jaime will be there.

你说过他那时对你很敬重
You said he treated you honorably before.

我不是在担心自己
I'm not worried about me.

我是说扔下你和小指头在一起, 太危险了
It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.

我身边有一堆守卫, 个个都很乐于把他抓起来 或者砍掉他的脑袋 不管你在不在这儿
I have many guards who would happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.

您相信他们的忠诚? 
And you trust their loyalty?

您相信他们没有被他暗中收买? 
You trust he hasn't been speaking to them all behind your back?

起码让我把波德瑞克留下来保护您吧
Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.

他现在是个合格的剑士了…
He has become a competent swordsman...

我不需要被保护 被担心 被照顾
I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.

我是临冬城公爵夫人, 而且我在自己家
I am the Lady of Winterfell, and I am home.

这对我来说是最安全的地方
This is the safest place for me.

我发过誓要保护您和您妹妹
I swore an oath to protect you and your sister.

如果我抛下您…  此去君临路途遥远 布蕾妮小姐 现在又不比夏天
If I abandon you... The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne, and you won't be traveling on summer roads.

你动身越早, 越不容易耽误时机
The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time.

世界上最重要的人 不能飞到世界上最危险的地方去
The most important person in the world can't fly off to the most dangerous place in the world.

除了我还有谁能去?   没人能
Who else can? No one.

他们离开时明知有多危险
They knew the risks when they left.

您要是死了还怎么夺回王座
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

又何谈改变历史
You can't break the wheel if you're dead.

所以, 你想让我怎么做? 
So, what would you have me do?

有时候最难的就是沉住气
Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.

万一您死了, 我们就全盘皆输
If you die, we're all lost.

所有人, 所有的一切
Everyone, everything.

你之前就让我静观其变, 我听了
You told me to do nothing before and I listened to you.

我不会再坐以待毙了
I'm not doing nothing again.

你骑马回去 跟我一起走啊
You ride for the pass. Come with me.

后会有期, 克里冈
We'll meet again, Clegane.

该走了, 我的陛下
It's time to go, Your Grace.

不是你要找的东西? 
Not what you're looking for?

在这临冬城里 我有几百忠勇之士
I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.

远水解不了近渴
They're not here now.

你从哪儿弄的? 
Where did you get them?

从布拉佛斯 在我接受无面者训练的时候
In Braavos, while I was training to be a Faceless Man.

在布拉佛斯 我还没得到第一张脸的时候 经常玩一个游戏
Back in Braavos, before I got my first face, there was a game I used to play.

我问一个关于你的问题 你要撒一个以假乱真的谎
I ask you a question about yourself, and you try to make lies sound like the truth.

要是你骗得过我 你就赢了
If you fool me, you win.

要是被我识破 你就输了
If I catch a lie, you lose.

我不想玩
I don't want to play.

琼恩当上国王 你心里怎么想? 
How do you feel about Jon being king?

你是否觉得某人比他更有资格统治北境呢? 
Is there someone else you think should rule the North instead of him?

那些脸是怎么来的? 
Those faces, what are they?

这是你该问的吗? 
You want to do the asking?

上一个在游戏里向我提问的人 最后结果可不大好
The Game of Faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.

告诉我它们是哪儿来的
Tell me what they are.

我们小时候都想变成别人的样子
We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.

你想做个王后 坐在铁王座上年轻英俊的国王身边
You wanted to be a queen, to sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne.

我想做个骑士 想跟父亲一样执剑战斗
I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like Father and go off to battle.

我们都没能变成别人的样子 对吧
Neither of us got to be that other person, did we?

这个世界就是不让女孩成为自己想要的样子
The world doesn't just let girls decide what they're going to be.

有这些脸供我选择
With the faces, I can choose.

我就能变成别人
I can become someone else.

用他们的声音说话 活在他们的皮囊之下
Speak in their voice, live in their skin.

我甚至能变成你
I could even become you.

我有点好奇 穿着这么漂亮的裙子会是什么感觉… 做临冬城公爵夫人会是什么感觉
I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses...  to be the Lady of Winterfell.

要知道这些 我唯一需要的… 就是你的脸
All I'd need to find out...  is your face.

要是我能带它回来就好了
I wish I could take it back.

要是我们没去就好了
I wish we'd never gone.

如果我们没去 我就看不到那些景象
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

眼见方能为实
You have to see it to know.

龙是我的孩子
The dragons are my children.

我不会再有别的孩子了
They're the only children I'll ever have.

我们会消灭夜王和他的军队
We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.

我们会并肩作战
And we'll do it together.

上次这么叫我的是谁来着
Who was the last person who called me that?

我记不清了, 是我哥哥吗? 
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

嗯, 他可不太讨人喜欢啊
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

叫'女王陛下'怎么样? 
How about 'my queen'?

我想, 嗯, 屈膝行礼, 但是…
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

那你要如何向你的臣民们交代呢? 
What about those who swore allegiance to you?

他们都会看到你是什么样的人
They'll all come to see you for what you are.

你该休息了
You should get some rest.

真正要紧的战争只有一场, 它已经打响了
There is only one war that matters. And it is here.

油?   是沥青 大人
Oil?  Pitch, my lord.

有多少桶?   500 桶 大人
How many barrels?  500, my lord.

直到现在 他们叫我'大人'都还挺受用的
I still enjoy it when they call me 'my lord.'

不过这种兴奋感早晚会消退
The thrill will fade.

前提是我们能活到那时候
If we live that long.

如果我被去了势 肯定不会在军队里卖命打仗
You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock.

都那样了还打仗 图个啥? 
What's left to fight for?

我这辈子都在和当兵的打交道
I spent my life around soldiers.

你以为他们会把金子花在哪里? 
What do you think they spend that gold on?

没了鸡巴 你就不能给家庭花钱了
Not without a cock, you don't.

也许最终都是鸡巴说了算
Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.

但是 你弟弟却选择了和去势者为伍
Yet, your brother has chosen to side with the cockless.

是啊 他一直都是弱势者的英雄
Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.

看来我们也要被去势了
I think we're about to be the downtrodden.

有多少人住在这里?   一百万左右
How many people live here?  A million, give or take.

把全北境的人口算进去也没这么多
That's more people than the entire North crammed into that.

为什么会有人喜欢挤在这里? 
Why would anyone want to live that way?

城里好找工作
There's more work in the city.

妓院更是无与伦比
And the brothels are far superior.

她怎么没和他们一起? 
Why isn't she with them?

陛下 恕我并不清楚缘由
I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace.

剩下的人呢? 
And the rest of them?

他们正在前往龙穴的路上
They're on their way to the Dragonpit now.

我们的弟弟也在? 
Including our brother?

如果有什么不对劲的 先宰了那银发婊子 然后是我们的弟弟 接着是那个自立为王的野种
If anything goes wrong, kill the silver haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.

剩下的人你按照什么顺序杀了都行
The rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit.

是时候会会我们的贵宾了
It's time for us to meet our guests.

他们为什么要修建这么一个地方? 
Why did they build it?

巨龙分不清什么是属于它们的 什么不是
Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't.

土地 牲畜 孩子…
Land, livestock, children...

所以 由着它们在城市四周晃悠可能会很麻烦
Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.

我能想象得到这最后是个悲伤的笑话
I imagine it was a sad joke at the end.

整个竞技场最后只养了几头比狗还小的病恹恹的动物
An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs.

但最初 这里还住着'黑死神'贝勒里恩的时候 这一定是世上最危险的地方
But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.

你们的朋友比你们先到一步
Your friends arrived before you did.

我奉命护送你们所有人到会场
I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.

窘境下的意外之喜啊
A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.

大人 我从没想过还能再次见到您
I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.

见到我仍然站在敌人那边 一如既往
Supporting the enemy, no less.

这也不能怪您  瑟曦可不这么觉得
Hard to blame you.  Cersei will anyway.

我很高兴您还活着
I'm glad you're alive.

等会再吸他的魔法大屌
You can suck his magic cock later.

我还以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

你当时下手再狠点我就真死了
You came pretty close.

我只是在尽力保护她
I was only trying to protect her.

你在这儿 那谁来保护她? 
Who's protecting her if you're here?

现在谁敢挡她的道 才需要考虑一下要怎么保护自己
The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.

现在走来的是… 黑水湾的英雄们
Here we are...  the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

真是奇怪的重逢地点
Strange place for a reunion.

我不觉得自己算什么大人了 波德瑞克
I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick.

还是把这头衔留给黑水河的波隆爵士吧
Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

我敢肯定如果你的新女王坐上铁王座的话 她会很乐意把你的头衔还给你
I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne.

你已经考虑过我们的新女王了? 
You've been thinking about our new queen?

也许你得重新考虑一下该效忠谁了
Perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances.

记住我的提议… 无论他们付给你多少酬劳 我都出双倍
Remember my offer...  whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double.

你现在到底能拿多少? 
And that would be double what now, exactly?

不用你来担心我 我现在一切都好
Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right.

我把自己照顾的很好  是吗? 
Looking after myself.  Are you?

你帮我组织了这次会谈 还敢说是把自己照顾得很好? 
Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it?

你是让自己身处险境
You put yourself at risk.

我是让你身处险境 很不一样
I put yourself at risk. Important difference.

瑟曦女王悬赏一袋金龙要的是你的头 不是我的
It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

更何况现在多亏了我 两个叛徒的脑袋要进她的门
Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door.

一旦听腻了他们臭嘴里的那些俏皮话 她就会一刀砍掉他俩的头
She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes.

这些都多亏了牛逼的黑水河的波隆爵士
All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.

如果那都不算是照顾好自己 我还真不知道什么算是了
If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.

再次见到你很高兴
It's good to see you again.

如果有任何人敢碰它 我先杀了你
Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.

趁这些大人物商谈大事的时候 咱们一起去喝一杯 嗯? 
Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?

我离开了这个该死的城市 是因为我不想死在这里
I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it.

现在我会死在这个该死的城市吗? 
Am I going to die in this shit city?

这都是你的主意
And this is all your idea.

好像每个坏点子背后都有兰尼斯特家的混蛋在出主意
Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.

同时还有克里冈家的混蛋在帮他们一手
And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.

你他妈的现在比我丑多了
You're even fucking uglier than I am now.

他们对你做了些什么? 
What did they do to you?

你不会就那么死去的 哥哥
That's not how it ends for you, brother.

你知道谁会来解决你
You know who's coming for you.

没和你们一起来? 
Didn't travel with you?

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
'风暴降生'  在龙石岛的女王

我们已经等候多时了
We've been here for some time.

我们所有人都面临着一个前所未有的…
We are all facing a unique...

如果你不立刻臣服于我
If you don't submit to me here, now...

我认为我们应该先从大事谈起
I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.

那哪能轮到你在这废话? 
Then why are you talking?

你是这里最小的
You're the smallest concern here.

你记得我们说过的侏儒的笑话吗? 
Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?

他说的根本不好笑
His wasn't even good.

他说完总要解释一下
He explained it at the end.

不要解释 解释就毁了
Never explain. It always ruins it.

我们铁群岛从来都不会 让你这种侏儒活下来 懂吗? 
We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know?

你一生下来就会被杀死
We kill you at birth.

这是对你父母的一种仁慈
An act of mercy for the parents.

或许你应该坐下
Perhaps you ought to sit down.

我们是一群互相看不顺眼的人 最近这几场战争已经说明了这一点
We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown.

我们都因彼此而经受过苦难
We have suffered at each other's hands.

也因互相争斗而失去挚爱
We have lost people we love at each other's hands.

如果我们只想继续缠斗不休 聚集此地也就没有了意义
If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering.

我们完全可以直接兵戈相见 而不必当面会见
We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face to face.

那你认为我们应该把争议放在一边 然后和谐地生活在一起? 
So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?

谁都知道那是不可能的
We all know that will never happen.

那我们到底为何而来
Then why are we here?

现在根本还谈不上和谐共存
This isn't about living in harmony.

只是为了生存下去
It's just about living.

我们所有人都面临着同样的威胁
The same thing is coming for all of us.

一个根本不可能谈判的将军
A general you can't negotiate with.

带领着一支能将战场上每一具尸体都化为己用的军队
An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield.

提利昂大人告诉我这城里有一百万人口
Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city.

他们也将会变成亡者大军里的百万雄兵
They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

我猜大多数人会觉得那样活得更好
I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.

如果不是事态紧急 我也不会来到这里
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

这种问题根本无法严肃
I don't think it's serious at all.

只不过是又一个无趣的笑话
I think it's another bad joke.

如果我的弟弟詹姆没有说错的话 你是来请求休战的
If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.

让我的军队撤退待命 而你骑着你的怪物继续大肆屠杀
Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt.

或者继续巩固势力 扩大领土
Or while you solidify and expand your position.

如果我下令撤军 你会继续采取哪条路线?  直到你率领比现在多三倍的军队回到我的都城 我才能知道吧
Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.

北方的威胁平息之前 你的都城会安然无恙
Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with.

一个准篡位者的保证
The word of a would be usurper.

过去五十年的恩怨纠葛 不会因一场谈话而抹去
There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years.

我们有东西想给你看看
We have something to show you.

我们可以烧死他们
We can destroy them by burning them.

也可以用龙晶杀死他们
And we can destroy them with dragonglass.

如果这场战争我们输了 那世界上所有人都会落得如此下场
If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.

只有这场战争才有意义 生存之战
There is only one war that matters...  the Great War.

如果不是亲眼见到他们 我也无法相信
I didn't believe it until I saw them.

十万大军 最少来说
A hundred thousand, at least.

我这就带着铁舰队返回铁群岛
I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.

你说什么? 
What are you talking about?

我曾周游世界
I've been around the world.

见识无数 包括很多你无法想象的东西 但这是… 这是唯一一次吓到我的
I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this...  this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.

我要回到我的岛上去
I'm going back to my island.

你也应该回你的地盘
You should go back to yours.

当凛冬结束 我们就会是唯一幸存的活人
When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.

他害怕是对的
He's right to be afraid.

如果这些东西朝我们袭来 没有一个王国能够幸存
If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule.

我们承受的苦难将没有意义
Everything we suffered will have been for nothing.

我们失去的一切也将没有意义
Everything we lost will have been for nothing.

铁王座接受你的休战请求
The crown accepts your truce.

直到消灭亡者大军 因为他们才是真正的敌人
Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.

作为回报 北境之王要延长休战时间
In return, the King in the North will extend this truce.

他必须留在他的北境
He will remain in the North where he belongs.

他不能起兵与兰尼斯特为敌
He will not take up arms against the Lannisters.

他也不能选择任何一边
He will not choose sides.

只包括北境之王? 
Just the King in the North?

我永远不会向你提这种要求
I would never ask it of you.

你也永远不会同意
You would never agree to it.

如果你同意 我反而更加不信任你
And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now.

我只想要奈德·史塔克之子的承诺
I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.

我知道他的儿子会信守承诺
I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word.

我言出必行
I am true to my word.

但正因如此 我不能答应你
That is why I cannot give you what you ask.

我不能同时效忠两个女王
I cannot serve two queens.

我已经宣誓效忠 坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝女王
And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

那就没什么好谈的了
Then there is nothing left to discuss.

亡者大军会先到达北境 好好享受这场战争吧
The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them.

我们会处理你们变成的那些东西
We will deal with whatever is left of you.

很高兴见到你
It's been good to see you.

我猜下次就要兵戎相见了
I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.

刚才我们都看到了
We both saw what just happened.

我们都看到了那个… 东西
We both saw that... thing.

是的 我一点也不想再见到那些东西
Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them.

但是我忠于瑟曦女王 你忠于珊莎和她的蠢哥哥
But I'm loyal to the queen, and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.

这已经无关家族 荣誉或者誓言
This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths.

你刚才没那么做就好了
I wish you hadn't done that.

我很感激你的忠诚 但我的龙为了这次谈判而死
I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here.

如果这场谈判以失败收场 那它就白白牺牲了
If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.

我很高兴你向我们的女王屈膝称臣
I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen.

就像之前我劝你的那样
I would have advised it, had you asked.

但是你有没有考虑过 学习一下偶尔撒个谎? 
But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then?

我绝不能违背誓言
I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold.

如果你想告诉我 我父亲就是因此而死的 那就说吧
Talk about my father if you want, tell me that's the attitude that got him killed.

但是太多的虚假承诺 就使得承诺没有了任何意义
But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything.

世间将没有真相 只有更精致的谎言
Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies.

谎言绝对无益于这场战争
And lies won't help us in this fight.

这确实是个问题
That is indeed a problem.

但现在更严重的问题是我们完了
The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.

有没有任何办法 来扭转局面? 
Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?

你们都待在这 我去和我的姐姐谈谈
Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.

我经历这一切前来 可不是让我的首相去送死
I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.

我也不想被瑟曦杀掉
I don't want Cersei to murder me either.

不然当时我就乖乖待在牢房里了 省得这些麻烦
I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.

该由我去  她一定会杀了你
I should go.  She'll definitely murder you.

由我独自去见姐姐
I go see my sister alone.

不然我们将无功而返 原地踏步 一无所获
Or we all go home and we're right back where we started.

你和她谈过了?   对 她还把我赶了出来
You spoke with her?  At her until she kicked me out.

瑟曦觉得我是个傻瓜 还相信你
She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.

实际上 似乎不少人也这么想
A lot of people seem to think that, actually.

我将要步入的这个房间里 有世上最残忍的女人 她还两次试图杀我 而这一切我都清清楚楚
I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of.

我们该道别了 两个傻瓜之间的道别
I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.

意料之中呀
I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.

她是你喜欢的那类女人… 自高自大的外国婊子
She's your kind of woman...  a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.

不能绑架 毒打或者胁迫 一个你不能拿她如何的外国婊子
A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate.

对你来说挺不容易对付的吧
That must be difficult for you.

所以你把她和她的北境男宠弄到这儿来 还设法说服了那家伙向她效忠  我之前并不知道这件事
So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.  I didn't know about that.

可现在你把他俩弄到一块儿了 目标一致 而且是你这一生为之努力的目标…
And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life...

瑟曦 我之前并不知道  … 摧毁整个家族
Cersei, I didn't know.  ...the destruction of this family.

我来是为了避免那一切发生
I am the one preventing that from happening.

丹妮莉丝最开始不可能来讨论或谈判
Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate.

也不可能来跟你对话
She didn't want to bring you words.

她只想要带来血与火 直到我向她谏言
She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise.

我并不想摧毁我们的家族
I don't want to destroy our family.

你杀了父亲
You killed our father.

我因从未犯过的罪 被他判了死刑 没错 我的确杀了他
After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him.

要恨我就恨我吧
Hate me for it if you want.

且不说他是我父亲 也不论他对我做的那些 我是杀了他 也依然痛恨我自己
I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.

父亲对你不好
Your papa was mean to you.

可当你射出那支弩箭时 你知道自己在做什么吗? 
Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow?

你把我们暴露给了贪婪的敌人 而敌人害得我们一家分离
You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart.

或许并不是你害死了乔佛里 但是你害死了弥赛菈 是你害死了托曼
You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen.

如果父亲还在世 没人敢动他们一下
No one would've touched them if Father was here.

没人胆敢…   万分抱歉
No one would have dared...  I have never been more sorry about anything.

我不想听到这话 更不想从你口中听到
I will not hear it, not from you.

你爱你的家庭 而我毁了这一切
You love your family, and I have destroyed it.

我永远都是个威胁
I will always be a threat.

如果不是因为我 母亲还在世
If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother.

如果不是因为我 父亲也还活着
If it weren't for me, you'd have a father.

如果不是因为我 你还会拥有一双漂亮的儿女
If it weren't for me, you'd have two beautiful children.

我也早已不止一次 想过要杀了你
I've thought about killing you more times than I can count.

你不曾知道 孩子们的事情 我非常抱歉
I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.

我不…   无所谓 但我深爱他们
I will not...  I don't care. I loved them.

你心里还有些感情 就会明白我所说的
You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.

你的爱无关紧要 感受也无关紧要
Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter.

我不关心原因 也不在乎你做了什么
I don't care why you did what you did.

我只在意我们付出了什么
I only care what it cost us.

我们付出了未来
It cost us our future.

如果真的没有了未来 那我们为何在这儿? 
If there's no future, then why are we here?

你又为何允许我来见你? 
Why did you allow me to come?

绝不是为了帮助敌人联手对付我
Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.

当然不是 也不是你想要的那样 但你一定有非要不可的东西
Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.

那你又想要什么? 
What did you hope for?

让琼恩·雪诺效忠你的女王?   嗯 不是这样的方式
To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?  Mm, not like this.

可实际上 你想要所有人都臣服她
But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.

我相信 她能让世界变好
Because I think she will make the world a better place.

可你说她想毁了君临城
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

她所选的谋臣 会忠言进谏而不是一味顺从
She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.

这是她和你的不同
That's the difference between you.

我不关心忠言进谏
I don't care about checking my worst impulses.

也不在乎让世界更美好
I don't care about making the world a better place.

你来的那东西
That thing you dragged here,

我知道那是什么 也明白那意味着什么
I know what it is, I know what it means.

当那家伙朝我冲来时 我并没有在想这个世界
And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world.

当他张开嘴 世界消失了 消失在他黑乎乎的喉咙里
As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.

我所能想到的 就是把那口咬得咯咯作响的白牙 从我重视的人们面前弄走 从我的家族面前弄走
All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊或许是对的
Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.

登上船 带走重要的人们…
Get on a boat, take those who matter...

应该不会有人比我更难受了吧
No one is less happy about this than I am.

我尊重你的选择
I respect what you did.

尽管我不希望你那么做 但我尊重你所做的
Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.

这个地方是我的家族末日的开端
This place was the beginning of the end for my family.

龙并不是奴隶
A dragon is not a slave.

龙令人生惧
They were terrifying.

龙让人们惊叹 敬畏 可我们却把龙锁在这儿
They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here.

我们家族也是如此
And we grew small as well.

没有龙 我们不再独一无二
We weren't extraordinary without them.

和芸芸众生没有区别
We were just like everyone else.

但你并不是普通人
You're not like everyone else.

你的家族也并没有走向终结
And your family hasn't seen its end.

可我无法生育
I can't have children.

害死了我丈夫的女巫
The witch who murdered my husband.

难道你没有想过 那个女巫可能故意骗你? 
Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?

你从一开始就是对的
You were right from the beginning.

我早就该相信你 事情就不会发展成这样了
If I had trusted you, everything would be different.

长城以北的所见让我触目惊心
I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall.

当我率军北上 不可能假装以为瑟曦会对这大半个王国无所作为
And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.

提利昂的那句话或许是对的
It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct.

我不会按兵不动
My armies will not stand down.

也不会下令撤回君临
I will not pull them back to the capital.

我将命令他们北进 在大战中协助你们
I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War.

黑暗正冲着我们所有人而来
The darkness is coming for us all.

我们要携手御敌
We'll face it together.

当这场大战结束 希望你们还记得 我曾选择帮助你们 即便你们当中没有人给予我承诺或保证
And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you.

让渡鸦在这种暴风雪中飞翔可不容易
It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms.

也许琼恩本想早些送信
Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.

不 他就是这样 一直都是这样
No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been.

他从不过问我的意见 这次又怎么会例外? 
He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?

难以置信 他没和你商量就放弃了北境的王位
I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.

这是他的笔迹 他的签名
This is his writing, his signature.

他宣誓为丹妮莉丝·坦格利安而战
He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen.

传言说 龙女王美貌非凡
I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.

这有什么关系? 
What does that have to do with anything?

琼恩年轻 未婚
Jon is young and unmarried.

丹妮莉丝年轻 独身
Daenerys is young and unmarried.

你觉得他想娶她? 
You think he wants to marry her?

结盟是明智的选择
An alliance makes sense.

他们并肩作战 就会难以被打败
Together, they'd be difficult to defeat.

他曾被拥为北境之王
He was named King in the North.

就算我同意 艾莉亚也绝不会同意
Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along.

她很爱琼恩 比爱我要多得多 她会杀掉任何背叛家族之人
She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.

艾莉亚真的会对亲姐姐痛下杀手吗? 
Would Arya really murder her own sister?

你知道她现在的身份吗? 
Do you know what she is now?

你知道无面者都是什么人吗? 
Do you know what the Faceless Men are?

我知道他们信奉死神
They worship the God of Death, I believe.

我从不信那些所谓的神
I never trust godly men.

而艾莉亚是其中一员
And Arya was one of them.

你认为她之后要干吗? 
What do you think she's after?

你比我了解她多了
You know her far better than I ever could.

有时候 我试图猜测别人的动机时
Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives,

就玩一个小游戏
I play a little game.

当他们说这些话 做这些事的时候 他们最可怕的动机可能是什么? 
What's the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do?

这个动机 能否合理解释他们的言行? 
How well does that reason explain what they say and what they do?

所以 告诉我… 她想要的最可怕的东西是什么? 
So, tell me...  what's the worst thing she could want?

她想要我死 因为她觉得我出卖了家族
She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.

她为什么来临冬城? 
Why did she come to Winterfell?

为了杀我 以报我嫁给敌人 背叛家族之仇
To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.

她为什么找出瑟曦强迫你写的那封信? 
Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?

为了有证据证实我背叛了家族
To provide proof of my betrayals.

好让她名正言顺地杀了我
To provide justification after she murders me.

那在她杀了你之后 她会成为什么? 
And after she murders you, what does she become?

如果让多斯拉克骑兵在国王大道上疾行 两周之内就能到达临冬城
If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.

他们可以航行至白港 与多斯拉克骑兵在国王大道上会合 在这个位置 然后一同前往临冬城
We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.

也许您应该乘龙飞去临冬城 陛下
Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace.

您在北境树敌不少
You have many enemies in the North.

成千人因反抗您父亲而战死
Thousands fell fighting your father.

只要一个手持十字弓的愤怒之人
All it takes is one angry man with a crossbow.

在国王大道上看见您的银发 精准的一箭就可让他青史留名
He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well placed bolt will make him a hero.

成为杀死征服者的人
The man who killed the conqueror.

请您自己定夺 陛下
It's your decision, Your Grace.

但如果我们要在这场战争中结盟 让北境人亲眼目睹这一刻相当重要
But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies.

如果我们共同航行至白港
If we sail to White Harbor together,

就能很好地说明问题
I think it sends a better message.

我不是来征服北境的
I've not come to conquer the North.

我是来拯救北境的
I'm coming to save the North.

我能和你说两句话吗? 
Can I speak with you?

你在君临的所作所为 你说的话… 你本可以欺骗瑟曦 说你没向丹妮莉丝屈膝称臣
What you did in King's Landing, what you said...  you could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys.

你冒着全盘皆输的风险只为告诉敌人真相
You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.

我们是去讲和的
We went down there to make peace.

我觉得坦诚相待很重要 如果我们要并肩作战的话
And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.

你总知道怎么做才对
You've always known what was right.

即使在我们都年少无知的时候 你也总是知道
Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew.

你走的每一步… 都是正确的
Every step you take...  it's always the right step.

从旁观者的角度来看可能如此 但我跟你保证 事实不是这样
It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true.

我做了很多让我后悔的事
I've done plenty of things that I regret.

跟我比起来那也不算什么
Not compared to me, you haven't.

我一直都想做正确的事
I always wanted to do the right thing.

做个好人
Be the right kind of person.

但我一直不懂该怎么做
But I never knew what that meant.

就好像… 一直以来我都面临着一个艰难的抉择
It always seemed like there's...  like there was an impossible choice I had to make.

对你来说 我们的父亲比你生父更像一个真正的父亲
Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.

确实  而你背叛了他
He was.  And you betrayed him.

但你从未失去他
But you never lost him.

就像他也是我的一部分…
Just like he's a part of me.

但我做过的事…
But the things I've done...

我没有资格原谅你的全部行径
It's not my place to forgive you for all of it.

但就我个人而言
But what I can forgive,

你不必做出选择
You don't need to choose.

你姓葛雷乔伊… 也是史塔克家族的成员
You're a Greyjoy...  and you're a Stark.

在我还是拉姆斯的囚徒时
When I was Ramsay's prisoner,

亚拉试图救我
Yara tried to save me.

只有她一个 试过救我
She's the only one who tried to save me.

那你现在还在这磨叽什么? 
So, why are you still talking to me?

小伙子们 加把劲儿
Load up, lads. Go on.

我们都曾自愿跟随亚拉
All of us chose to follow Yara.

为了她离开铁群岛
We left the Iron Islands for Yara.

她绝对不会抛弃我们中的任何一个人
She would never leave one of us behind.

我们也不能抛弃她
We're not leaving her behind.

她没死  就是死了
She's not dead.  She's dead.

就算攸伦现在还没割她喉 她也死路一条
Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.

她是我们的女王  她是你姐 而你抛下她等死
She's our queen.  She's your sister, and you left her to die.

所以 我们他妈的为什么要听你的? 
So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you?

他们说尸鬼不会游泳
They say the dead can't swim.

我们要向东航行 找一个漂亮 安静的岛 杀掉那儿的人 抢走他们的妻子
We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.

我们不再做这种事了  谁说的? 
We're done with all that.  Who says we are?

亚拉说的 她宣誓了
Yara did. She made a pledge.

我们要去找她 然后救她出来
We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free.

你还是快跑吧 小席恩
Run away, little Theon.

逃跑才是你最擅长的本领
It's what you do best.

让他闭嘴
He needs to shut his mouth.

待着别动… 不然我就弄死你!
Stay down...  or I'll kill you!

我说了待着别动! 不然我就弄死你!
I said stay down or I'll kill you!

把我妹妹带到大厅去
Have my sister brought to the Great Hall.

约恩·罗伊斯
'青铜' 符石城伯爵

你真的要这样做? 
Are you sure you want to do this?

我并不愿意 但家族荣誉令我不得不如此
It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.

家族荣誉要求你做什么了? 
And what does honor demand?

要求我守护家人 不让他们为奸人所害
That I defend my family from those who would harm us.

要求我守护北境 不让它为叛徒所染指
That I defend the North from those who would betray us.

你被控犯有谋杀罪
You stand accused of murder.

你被控犯有叛国罪
You stand accused of treason.

对此你作何解释…
How do you answer these charges...

我姐姐问你话呢
My sister asked you a question.

珊莎小姐 请原谅…
Lady Sansa, forgive me...

你有什么不明白的呢? 
Which charges confuse you?

先说说最简单的一桩吧… 你杀害了我们的阿姨 莱莎·艾林
Let's start with the simplest one...  you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

你将她推下月门 眼看着她摔下去
You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall.

我是为了保护您才那样做的
I did it to protect you.

你是为了夺取谷地的统治权才那样做的
You did it to take power in the Vale.

在那之前 你还密谋杀害琼恩·艾林
Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn.

你给了莱莎里斯之泪 让她毒死他
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him.

不管您阿姨都告诉了您些什么… 她的心智有问题啊
Whatever your aunt might have told you...  she was a troubled woman.

她总觉得到处都有敌人
She imagined enemies everywhere.

你让莱莎阿姨写信给我们的父母 告诉他们杀害琼恩·艾林的是兰尼斯特家族 但实际上 是你杀的
You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn when, really, it was you.

史塔克家族和兰尼斯特家族之间的冲突 是你挑起的
The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters, it was you who started it.

我从来没听说过有这封信
I know of no such letter.

你和瑟曦·兰尼斯特 还有乔佛里·拜拉席恩沆瀣一气 背叛我们的父亲奈德·史塔克
You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark.

因为你的暗算 他被关进地牢 后被处死 都因为这捏造的叛国罪
Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason.

还要抵赖吗?   我否认!
Do you deny it?  I deny it!

到底发生了什么你们谁都没有看到
None of you were there to see what happened.

谁都不知道真相
None of you knows the truth.

你把匕首架在他喉咙上
You held a knife to his throat.

还说 '我警告过您不要信任我'
You said, 'I did warn you not the trust me.'

你告诉我们的母亲 说这把匕首是提利昂·兰尼斯特的
You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

那也是你撒的谎之一
But that was another one of your lies.

珊莎夫人 您还是个孩子的时候我们就认识了
Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl.

我保护过您啊  保护过我? 
I've protected you.  Protected me?

把我卖给波顿家族来保护我? 
By selling me to the Boltons?

如果您允许我单独跟您谈谈
If we could speak alone,

我就能解释清楚一切
I can explain everything.

当我试图弄清某人的企图的时候
Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives,

我会玩一个小游戏
I play a little game.

让我和妹妹反目 背后最可怕的目的是什么呢? 
What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister?

这不就是你的把戏吗? 
That's what you do, isn't it?

这就是你一直在玩的手段… 挑拨家族内乱 姐妹反目
That's what you've always done...  turn family against family, turn sister against sister.

这就是你对我们的母亲和莱莎阿姨所做的 还准备对我们故伎重演
That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa, and that's what you tried to do to us.

确实 我学起谋略来很慢
I'm a slow learner, it's true.

给我一个为自己辩护的机会吧
Give me a chance to defend myself.

我可是谷地守护者 我命令你们护送我安全回到鹰巢城
I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.

我从小就爱慕你的母亲
I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.

但你还是背叛了她
And yet, you betrayed her.

但你还是背叛了我
And yet, you betrayed me.

你带我回到临冬城的时候 告诉我世上没有正义可言 除非我们去亲手夺取
When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it.

感谢你的诸多教导 贝里席大人
Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish.

我永远不会忘记
I will never forget them.

我们在君临的部队 三天后将会向北进发
Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.

但搜集部队所需的物资 需要两周时间啊
It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.

我们拿不出两周时间
We don't have a fortnight.

北境要是陷落 我们也会灭亡 给你三天时间
If the North falls, we fall. Three days.

西境剩余的军队 将会取道河间大道以东
The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east.

我们在哈罗威伯爵城下会师 然后一起向临冬城进军
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.

诸位 我需要和我弟弟单独说几句话
My lords, I need a moment with my brother.

你在干什么?   准备远征北方
What are you doing?  Preparing the expedition north.

我就知道你是家族里最蠢的那个
I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister.

史塔克家族和坦格利安家族已经结盟对抗起我们了 你居然还想跟他们并肩作战? 
The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them?

你是叛徒还是傻子? 
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

你发过誓要一起打击我们共同的敌人的…
You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy...

只要能保证家族的延续 该说的我都会说
I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house.

你以为我会信任杀害了父亲的人吗? 
You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father?

你以为我会命令我们的部队和异邦渣滓一起 为龙女王作战吗? 
You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum, to fight for the Dragon Queen?

你自己也亲眼看见了
You saw it with your own eyes.

那个死人试图要杀我们
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

如果龙不能消灭他们 如果多斯拉克人 无垢者还有北境人都不能消灭他们 我们的军队又能做什么呢? 
If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?

这不是贵族与贵族间的战争 这是活人和死尸间的战争!
This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!

而我打算待在活人中间
And I intend to stay amongst the living.

就让那个史塔克小子和他的新女王去保卫北境吧
Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North.

我们待在我们的老地方
We stay here where we've always been.

我们的孩子将会统治维斯特洛
Our child will rule Westeros.

要是尸鬼南下 我们的孩子就永远不可能出生了
Our child will never be born if the dead come south.

这些怪物确实存在
The monsters are real.

异鬼 龙 多斯拉克哮吼武士 我们小时候听的那些吓唬人的故事 全都是真的
The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers...  all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real.

让这些怪物们自相残杀吧
Let the monsters kill each other.

当他们在北方打得你死我活的时候 我们就夺回原本属于我们的土地
And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.

然后呢?   然后我们继续统治
And then what?  And then we rule.

等北方的战事结束 某一方胜利了
When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins.

你明白这些 是吧? 
You understand that, don't you?

如果死人赢了 他们会横扫南方 把我们全杀了
If the dead win, they march south and kill us all.

如果活人赢了 我们背叛过他们 他们也会一路向南 把我们全杀了!
If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!

坦格利安家族和史塔克家族已经想把我们全灭
The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all.

他们中的大部分会在北境死去
Most of them will die in the North.

我在战场上面对过他们
I faced them in the field.

我们没有机会 我们没法战胜龙
We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.

你看见了几条龙? 
How many dragons did you see at the pit?

两条  那第三条怎么了? 
Two.  What happened to the third?

据我们所知 它在保护丹妮莉丝的舰队!
For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!

她带着她的龙 多斯拉克人和无垢者来到这里
She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

她是来炫耀她的全部武力
She came here to show us all her power.

不对 一定是有事情发生 龙不是无敌的
No, something happened. The dragons are vulnerable.

我们打不过多斯拉克人 我们寡不敌众
We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers.

没有任何家族支持我们!
We don't have the support of the other houses!

不 有更好的势力支持我们 我们有铁金库
No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank.

父亲谈论黄金的重要性时 你真该多听听
You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold.

哦 那对你来说太无聊了 我懂
Oh, I know it's boring for you.

你只想打猎 骑马 战斗
You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight.

但是我听了 我学到了
But I listened, I learned.

高庭的黄金给我们带来了厄斯索斯最强劲的军队… 黄金团
Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos...  the Golden Company.

应该有两万人 战马 还有战象
20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe.

远水解不了近渴啊
The Golden Company is not here.

身在厄斯索斯的佣兵团能怎么帮助我们? 
How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?

你真的觉得攸伦·葛雷乔伊临阵脱逃 驶回铁群岛了吗? 
Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands?

你觉得他放弃了 迎娶女王的机会吗? 
Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?

没人会离我而去
No one walks away from me.

他正率舰队驶往厄斯索斯
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

他将载着黄金团而归 来帮助我们赢下战争 赢下维斯特洛
He's going to ferry the Golden Company back here to help us win the war for Westeros.

你和攸伦·葛雷乔伊密谋了这件事 却没事先告诉我 我可是你军队的总司令啊
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander of your armies?

而你和提利昂密谋了那次会面 他可是我们的杀父仇人 你事先也没有告诉我——你的女王
And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father, without telling me, your queen.

我没和他密谋任何事
I didn't conspire with him.

你未经我同意秘密和他会面
You met with him in secret without my consent.

你计划着让我的敌人获益
You planned to promote my enemies' interests.

这就是阴谋的定义
That is the definition of conspiracy.

我承诺率军北上
I pledged to ride north.

我打算遵守诺言
I intend to honor that pledge.

而那将是叛国之举  叛国? 
And that will be treason.  Treason?

违背女王的命令 和她的敌人并肩作战
Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies.

你管这叫什么? 
What would you call it?

我叫它什么都无所谓
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

我告诉过你 没人能离我而去
I told you no one walks away from me.

你要让他杀了我? 
Are you going to order him to kill me?

我是你唯一的亲人了
I'm the only one you have left.

我们的孩子死了 父亲也死了
Our children are gone, our father is gone.

现在只剩我和你了
It's just me and you now.

还有一个即将出世
There's one more yet to come.

那就下令吧
Give the order, then.

我不确定你还能不能记住我
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

我能记住所有事
I remember everything.

你帮我们出了长城
You helped us get beyond the Wall.

你是个好人  噢 谢谢称赞 但是 呃 我也不确定我是不是好人
You're a good man.  Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am.

在塞外都发生了什么? 
What happened to you beyond the Wall?

我成了三眼乌鸦
I became the Three Eyed Raven.

我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that means.

我能看到过去发生的事
I can see things that happened in the past.

也能看到正在发生的事 世界各地的事
I can see things happening now all over the world.

你为什么来临冬城? 
Why did you come to Winterfell?

琼恩是对抗死者一战的领袖
Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead.

但是他一个人做不来 所以我来帮助他
But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.

他正在回临冬城的路上 和丹妮莉丝·坦格利安一起
He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen.

你… 你通过… 某种视野? 
You... you saw this in...  in a vision?

他需要知道真相
He needs to know the truth.

什么真相? 
The truth about what?

除了我 没有人知道
No one knows. No one but me.

琼恩并不是我父亲的儿子
Jon isn't really my father's son.

他是雷加·坦格利安和我姑姑莱安娜·史塔克的儿子
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

他在多恩的一座塔里出生
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

他其实并不姓雪诺 应该姓沙德
His last name isn't really Snow, it's Sand.

多恩的私生子都姓沙德
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

在学城 我抄了一个总主教的日记
At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary.

他废除了雷加和伊莉亚的婚姻
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.

然后他给雷加和莱安娜办了一场秘密婚礼
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.

总主教把这些写在了他的私人日记里
It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary.

我觉得他没理由撒谎
I don't know why he'd lie.

你能看到这种事情吗? 
Is this something you can see?

天父 铁匠 战士
Father, Smith, Warrior,

圣母 少女 老妪 陌客
Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.

我属于她 她属于我…   我属于他 他属于我… 从今日起 直至永远
I am hers and she is mine...  I am his and he is mine...  from this day until the end of my days.

劳勃的反叛建立在谎言之上
Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie.

雷加没有绑架或是强暴我姑姑
Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt or rape her.

他的名字是伊耿·坦格利安
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

你必须保护他
You have to protect him.

他从来都不是私生子
He's never been a bastard.

他是铁王座的继承人
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.

我相信他爱着我 以他自己那可怕的方式
In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.

你做了正确的事
You did the right thing.

我只是个刽子手
I'm just the executioner.

是你定的罪
You passed the sentence.

你才是临冬城公爵夫人
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

你对此很反感吗? 
Does that bother you?

我不会成为一个像你一样好的公爵夫人
I was never going to be as good a lady as you.

所以我得另寻出路
So I had to be something else.

我不会在你经历过的事中存活下来
I never could have survived what you survived.

你是我知道的最坚强的人
You're the strongest person I know.

我觉得这是你对我说过的最友善的话了
I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

别以为这就是常态
Well, don't get used to it.

你还是很奇怪 很烦人
You're still very strange and annoying.

'凛冬之时 我们必须保护自己
'In winter, we must protect ourselves.

彼此照应'
Look after one another.'

'当大雪降下 冷风吹起 独行狼死 群聚狼生'

真高啊
It's a long way down.

是啊 乌鸦们一直说我会习惯的
Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.

我看到有动静…
I can see movement...

你该为自己感到幸运
You should consider yourself lucky.

至少你的蛋蛋不会被冻掉
At least your balls won't freeze off.

别人拿侏儒开玩笑 你就生气 结果你又老是开阉人的玩笑 你怎么这样? 
You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?

因为我有蛋蛋 你没有
Because I have balls, and you don't.

北方人不怎么信任外来者
Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

艾莉亚呢? 不知道躲哪去了
Where's Arya? Lurking somewhere.

这是坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝女王
Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

这是我的妹妹 临冬城公爵夫人 珊莎・史塔克
My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.

史塔克夫人 感谢你邀请我们来到你家
Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark.

北境正如你哥哥所描绘的那样美丽 你也如北境的风光一样美丽动人
The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.

临冬城效忠于您 陛下
Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

我们现在没有时间聊这些
We don't have time for all this.

夜王已经转化了您的龙 它成了尸鬼
The Night King has your dragon. He's one of them now.

长城已破 亡者大军正向南行进
The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.

一听到长城倒塌的消息
As soon as we heard about the Wall,

我就召集了所有的封臣 撤退到临冬城
I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell.

安柏大人… 你的人什么时候到? 
Lord Umber...  when can we expect your people to arrive?

我们需要更多的马匹和马车 希望夫人允许
We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.

我们将为你倾囊相助
You'll have as many as we can spare.

尽快回到最后壁炉城 带你的人过来
Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.

我们还需要放出渡鸦 把消息传给守夜人
We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well.

现在还在这些城堡驻扎已经毫无意义了
There's no sense in manning the castles anymore.

我们要守住这里
We make our stand here.

现在您已经不是陛下了 对吧? 
But you're not. Are you?

您离开临冬城的时候还是北境之王 可回来时候却是一位――
You left Winterfell a king and came back a

我不太清楚您现在的身份到底算什么
I'm not sure what you are now.

这不重要 不重要? 
It's not important. Not important?

曾经 我们可是拥立您为北境之王
We named you King in the North.

那曾经是我人生中的荣光
It was the honor of my life.

我将永远对你们的信任感念于心
I'll always be grateful for your faith.

但当初我离开临冬城的时候
But when I left Winterfell,

我告诉过大家我们需要盟友 否则我们只有死路一条
I told you we need allies or we will die.

而现在我把盟友带回了家 与我们并肩作战
I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us.

我必须做出选择 是保住我的王位还是保住北境
I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North.

我们当中 要是有人能在接下来这场大战中活下来 那就得感谢琼恩・雪诺
If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

他冒着生命危险 证明威胁我们的东西是真实存在的
He risked his life to show us the threat is real.

多亏了他的勇气 我们才能带来 有史以来最强大的军队
Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen.

我们才能带回两条成年巨龙
We have brought two fullgrown dragons.

很快 兰尼斯特家族的军队 就会行军北上加入我们
And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.

我知道 我知道 我们家族 一直也算不上北境的盟友
I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past.

但我们现在必须携手作战… 否则我们都会死
But we must fight together now...  or die.

我想问一下 我们该怎么供给 这支有史以来最强大的军队呢? 
May I ask,how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen?

我能确保我们的存粮能撑过这个冬天
While I ensured our stores would last through winter,

但我可没有料到还要给多斯拉克大军
I didn't account for Dothraki,

无垢者 甚至两条成年巨龙做准备
Unsullied and two fullgrown dragons.

对了 龙吃什么? 
What do dragons eat, anyway?

嘿 注意点 小子 一丁点儿也不能漏掉
Hey, careful, lads.We need every last bit of it.

这是最后一车了吗? 
Are these the last of the wagons?

好吧 全都推去锻造处
All right, let's get it all to the forges.

约恩・罗伊斯
'青铜约恩' 谷地领主

临冬城公爵夫人
The Lady of Winterfell.

这头衔不错啊
Has a nice ring to it.

女王之手也不错
So does Hand of the Queen.

这得看是哪位女王了
Depending on the queen, I suppose.

我们上次谈话 还是在乔佛里的婚礼上
Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding.

真是不幸 总归有它的意义
Miserable affair.It had its moments.

我很抱歉就那样离开了
Apologies for leaving like that.

的确 有点难以解释 为什么在国王被谋杀后 我的妻子就逃跑了
Yes,it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

许多人低估了你
Many underestimated you.

他们当中 大部分都已经死了
Most of them are dead now.

听到兰尼斯特大军北上的消息 你应该并不高兴吧
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north.

你对我姐姐的恐惧可以理解
You have every right to be fearful of my sister.

没人比我更怕她
No one fears her more than I do.

但我一定会确保你的安全―― 瑟曦跟你说 她的军队会来北境为你作战? 
But I promise, you'll be safeCersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?

你也信了? 
And you believed her?

她现在有了活下去的动力
She has something to live for now.

我相信她是想活着的
I believe she wants to survive.

我还以为你是世界上最聪明的人
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

你以前蛮高的
You used to be taller.

你怎么跟到我的? 
How did you sneak up on me?

你怎么活过一剑穿心的? 
How did you survive a knife through the heart?

你用过它吗? 
Have you ever used it?

之前你在哪儿? 
Where were you before?

我可以让你劝说珊莎
I could've used your help with Sansa.

她不喜欢你的女王 对吧? 
She doesn't like your queen,does she?

珊莎觉得她比谁都聪明
Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

她是我遇到过的最聪明的人
She's the smartest person I've ever met.

现在你保护她? 
Now you're defending her?

我在保护我们的家族
I'm defending our family.

陛下 恐怕我带来了个坏消息
Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news.

亡者大军已经攻破长城了
The dead have broken through the Wall.

不如你就干脆一点杀了我吧
Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?

葛雷乔伊家族仅剩的几个
The last Greyjoys left in the world.

反正也是最有种的
The last ones with balls anyway.

如果我杀了你… 我跟谁说话去? 
If I kill you...  who can I talk to?

我的船员都是哑巴
I've got a crew full of mutes.

在海上 人就容易寂寞
It gets lonely at sea.

我们在君临城吗? 
Are we in King's Landing?

你选了失败的一方
You picked the losing side.

然后我会带着铁舰队去别处
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.

但首先我要干女王
But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

两万大军 是吗? 
Twentythousand men, is it?

是的 陛下 少数人死在来的路上了
Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

他们玩骰子作弊
They cheated at dice.

他们不是好战士 你不会想念他们的
They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.

马有多少?  两千
Horses? Two thousand.

呃 没有大象 女王陛下
Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

真让我失望
That's disappointing.

我听说黄金团是有大象的
I was told the Golden Company had elephants.

大象确实是非凡的猛兽 陛下 但不适应海上长途航行
They are excellent beasts, Your Grace but not wellsuited to long sea voyages.

不管怎样 非常欢迎 斯崔克兰团长来到君临城
In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

我们期待为您作战 我的陛下
We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.

那这里欢迎我吗
Am I most welcome here?

你是王室真诚的朋友 也是备受尊敬的贵宾
You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.

那作为真诚的朋友和尊敬的贵宾…
As a true friend and an honored guest...

我希望我们可以私下谈谈
I was hoping we could talk in private.

战争结束后 那是我们的协议
After the war. That was our agreement.

战争也许会持续数年
Wars sometimes last years.

你想要妓女 就买一个
You want a whore, buy one.

你想要女王… 就赢得她
You want a queen...  earn her.

我已经帮她主持正义 给了她佣兵团和一支铁舰队 然而她却没有表露出一丝爱意
I've given her justice, an army and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection.

我的心都要碎了
My heart is nearly broken.

被我处决的人少多了 他们都是小人物
I've executed men for less. They were lesser men.

听说 龙烧死了一千兰尼斯特士兵
I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.

死了几个我最喜欢的小伙子
Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

是阿奇吗?  还有威廉
Archie, was it? And William.

那个又高又帅的威廉? 对 就是他
Tall handsome William? Yeah, tall handsome William.

听说他被烧剩的骨头渣 只够盛满一个酒杯
They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.

我是你们见过的 唯一一个射过龙的人
I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.

真的? 差点把它杀死了
Did you? Nearly killed it.

那个叫艾迪的小子…    那个红头发的? 
That boy Eddie...  The ginger?

就是他 回来时脸都烧没了
That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off.

他现在没有眼皮了
He's got no eyelids now.

没眼皮他怎么睡觉啊? 
How does he sleep with no eyelids?

好了 能不能别他妈聊龙的事了? 
All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?

黑水河的波隆骑士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

抱歉打扰了 但女王确实催促我尽快前来
Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.

下次吧
Another time perhaps.

你有没有感觉孤单? 我偏爱年长的绅士
You ever get lonely, I am partial to older gentlemen.

可怜的姑娘 看这梅毒病情 她活不过一年
Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.

哪个姑娘?  女王的兄弟 但他们没能坚守诺言
Which girl? The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them.

女王陛下想要弥补这个过失
Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

她曾给了我城堡和妻子 然后又全部从我手中夺走
She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.

那是詹姆爵士所为 与她无关
That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

如果瑟曦女王对你有所求 她会预付你黄金
When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold.

实际上 是成箱的黄金
Several chests of it, in fact.

它们正在门外的马车里等着你
Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

所以她想杀人 又不能派自己的士兵去
So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.

如果她盯上的是龙女王…
If it's the Dragon Queen she's after...

对于那个坦格利安女孩 她另有谋划
She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.

啊 好吧 那祝计划成功
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

女王的弟弟们可能不会 在北境历险后平安归来
Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures.

但 万一他们活下来了…
But in the event that they do...

她想品味一场诗意的复仇
She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

学城驱逐我的时候
When the Citadel expelled me,

我以为我会潦倒孤独而死 但为了回报我的衷心侍奉  瑟曦女王封我为女王之手
I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

如果有人能帮她除掉叛国的弟弟们 她又会如何回报呢? 
What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

我本来想要大象的
I wanted those elephants.

那… 我和那个胖国王比起来怎么样? 
So...  how do I compare to the fat king?

你在侮辱我的先夫吗? 
You're insulting my late husband?

劳勃每晚都和不同的妓女过夜 但还是不懂该怎样对待女人的身体
Robert had a different whore every night but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.

你真是喜欢作死啊
You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

但你不是个无趣的人 这一点我承认
You're not boring, I'll give you that.

我是否取悦了女王陛下? 
Do I please the queen?

你可能是我遇见的最傲慢无礼的人
You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.

但现在我想独自待着
But now I want to be alone.

我要让你怀上我的王子
I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

攸伦保不住铁群岛 既然他和全部人马 舰队都在君临
Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.

我们可以趁机夺回铁群岛
We can take our home back.

如果北境失守 那丹妮莉丝就需要后撤的基地
Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North.

而尸鬼到不了铁群岛
Somewhere the dead can't go.

你是我的女王 我要去你指挥的地方
You're my queen. I go where you command.

你想去临冬城
You want to go to Winterfell.

为史塔克家战斗
To fight for the Starks.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

但无论如何要杀死那些混蛋
But kill the bastards anyway.

欢迎回家 小姐
Welcome back, my lady.

请跟我来…
If you'd follow me...

家族纹章不错
One of the better sigils.

反正比洋葱好看
Beats an onion, anyway.

无可辩驳
Can't argue with that.

史塔克和卡史塔克在战场上互相残杀 才过去没多久
Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield.

是琼恩・雪诺让两家重归于好
Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

女王陛下对此感激不尽
And our queen is grateful.

这自然很好 但重点不是这个
Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point.

北方人效忠于琼恩・雪诺 不是她
The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her.

自由民也不认她
The Free Folk don't know her.

我在北境呆的时间不短 但我告诉你 这儿的人倔得像头牛
I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats.

你得自己去争得他们的忠心
You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

我觉得你心里有话想说
I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

我想说的就是我正在说的
A proposal is what I'm proposing.

如果我们侥幸打败夜王活下来之后 如果七大王国能迎来 在他们整个狗屎历史中第一次 由一位公正的女人和一位可敬的男人共同统治
On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

他俩确实是天生一对
They do make a handsome couple.

你高估我们的影响力了
You overestimate our influence.

他们才不会听这些单身老男人的话
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.

我们的女王很尊敬长者的智慧
Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

这就叫敬而远之 好让我们不去忠言逆耳
Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.

你妹妹不喜欢我
Your sister doesn't like me.

因为她不了解你
She doesn't know you.

那我这样说你可能好受一些 小时候她也不喜欢我
If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

我并不是要她把我当作朋友 但我是她的女王
She doesn't need to be my friend...  but I am her queen.

如果她不尊敬我…
If she can't respect me...

龙的胃口不太好
The dragons are barely eating.

它们怎么了
What's wrong with them?

它们不喜欢北境
They don't like the North.

我不懂怎么驾驭巨龙
I don't know how to ride a dragon.

没人会 直到骑到龙背来
Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.

要是它不想让我上去呢
What if he doesn't want me to?

那我很感激你的陪伴 琼恩・雪诺
Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

你毁了我对骑马的兴趣
You've completely ruined horses for me.

我们可以在这儿呆一千年 没有人能找到我们
We could stay a thousand years...  no one would find us.

这里很冷对南方女孩来说
It's cold up here for a southern girl.

那就给你的女王温暖
So keep your queen warm.

用龙晶锻造如此巨大的剑并不容易
It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.

你说自己很厉害 是这样吗? 
You're saying you're good, is that it?

我只是说 这是个棘手的材料
I'm just saying it's a tricky material to

你知道都是谁给野人打造武器? 
You know who makes weapons for the wildlings?

瘸子和杂种
Cripples and cocksuckers.

你是哪一类?  放过他吧
Which one are you? Leave him be.

我听说你在这儿
I heard you were here.

你是个冷血小贱人 不是吗? 
You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?

我猜这就是你还活着的原因
Guess that's why you're still alive.

你给他打的那把斧子真不错
That was a nice ax you made for him.

你比以前更厉害
You've gotten better.

对 谢谢 你也一样
Yeah, thanks. So have you.

我是说 你看起来不错
I mean, you look good.

这不是一个好出生地, 如果不是那么冷的话
It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.

那就靠炉子近一点儿
Stay close to that forge, then.

这是命令吗? 史塔克小姐 别这么叫我
Is that a command, Lady Stark? Don't call me that.

你用这东西做什么用? 
What do you need something like this for?

你到底能不能做出来? 
Can you make it or not?

你不是已经有一把剑了 这又是什么? 
You already have a sword. What's that?

我就知道你也是个富家女
I always knew you were just another rich girl.

你不会认识其他富家女
You don't know any other rich girls.

葛洛佛大人祝我们好运 但他会和手下人留在深林堡
Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.

'葛洛佛家族将继续效忠于史塔克家族 一如千年以来那样'
'House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.'

他之前不就是这么说的吗? 
Isn't that what he said?

'我将效忠于琼恩・雪诺' 他是这么说的
'I will stand behind Jon Snow,' he said.

我们需要盟友 我告诉过你
I told you we needed allies.

可你没说过会将王位拱手让人
You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.

我从未想过当什么国王
I never wanted a crown.

我只想要保护北境
All I wanted was to protect the North.

我带回家两支军队 两条龙
I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

还有一位坦格利安家的女王
And a Targaryen queen.

你真觉得 没有她 我们能打败尸鬼大军? 
Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her?

珊莎 我亲自与它们战斗过 两次
I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

如果你在意的是头衔称谓
You want to worry about who holds what title,

那我就告诉你 这无关紧要
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

没有她 我们连一丝胜算都没有
Without her, we don't stand a chance.

你相信我吗? 哪怕一点儿
Do you have any faith in me at all?

她会是一位优秀的女王
She'll be a good queen.

她不像她的父亲那样
She's not her father.

对 她可漂亮多了
No, she's much prettier.

你屈膝下跪 是为了拯救北境 还是因为你爱她? 
Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?

我是哪个? 女王殿下? 
Which man am I, Your Grace?

当别人都救不了乔拉爵士的时候
The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.

他们可以 只是不愿意
They could, they just wouldn't.

我必须做一些改变 当我登上王位的时候
I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne.

一个好的付出值得很大的回报
A great service merits a great reward.

噢 能够效忠您就是我的荣幸了 陛下
Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

嗯 一定有什么我可以给你的
Well, there must be something I could give you.

如果不是太麻烦的话
If it's not too much trouble,

我想请求赦免
I could use a pardon.

我从学城借了一些书
I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

剑也是学城的?  不, 剑是我家族的
From the Citadel? From my family.

它一直在塔利家族 世世代代
It's been in House Tarly for generations.

不管怎样, 它最终应该我的 但我的父亲另有打算
It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.

我提出让他保留他的土地和头衔 如果他弯曲膝盖
I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee.

至少我还可以回家了 现在我弟弟是主人
At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.

你兄弟和你父亲站在一起
Your brother stood with your father.

谢谢您 陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

你在这里做什么? 
What are you doing out here?

等一个老朋友
Waiting, for an old friend.

是时候告诉琼恩真相了
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

你是他的弟弟 不该由你来告诉他吗
You're his brother.Shouldn't you tell him?

他信任你胜过任何人
He trusts you more than anyone.

我很抱歉, 我知道我不应该到这里
I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.

你一直在躲着我吗?  当然不是
Were you hiding from me? Of course not.

你怎么会在临冬城? 
What are you doing in Winterfell?

还是说你已经读完了学城所有的书? 
Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

吉莉? 她没事吧? 
Gilly? Is she all right?

她很好 小山姆呢? 
She's good. Little Sam?

丹妮莉丝… 她处决了我父亲还有弟弟
Daenerys...  she executed my father and brother.

她曾俘虏他们
They were her prisoners.

我们需要结束这场战争
We need to end this war.

你也会那么做吗? 
Would you have done it?

嗯, 我也曾处决过不服从我的人
Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

但你也宽恕过很多人
You've also spared men.

几千拒绝屈膝臣服的野人
Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.

我已经放弃王位了 山姆
I gave up my crown, Sam.

不再是北境之王了
I'm not King in the North anymore.

我说的不是北境之王
I'm not talking about the King in the North.

我说的是整个七大王国的国王
I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

布兰和我查清楚了
Bran and I worked it out.

我拿到一本总主教的日记 布兰有… 先不提布兰有什么了
I had a High Septon's diary.Bran had...  whatever Bran has.

你到底在说什么? 
What are you talking about?

你的母亲 是莱安娜・史塔克
Your mother...  was Lyanna Stark.

而你的父亲… 你的亲生父亲 是雷加・坦格利安
And your father...  your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen.

你从来都不是什么私生子
You've never been a bastard.

你真名为伊耿・坦格利安 铁王座的正统继承人
You're Aegon Targaryen,true heir to the Iron Throne.

抱歉 我知道这些很难接受
I'm sorry,I know it's a lot to take in.

我父亲是我见过的最信守荣誉之人
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.

你却告诉我他骗了我一辈子
You're saying he lied to me all my life.

你父亲 好吧 奈德・史塔克
Your fatherWell, Ned Stark.

他向你母亲承诺会一直保护你
He promised your mother he'd always protect you.

而他确实做到了 劳勃如果知道了真相一定会杀了你
And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew.

你才是真正的国王
You're the true king.

伊耿・坦格利安六世
Aegon Targaryen,Sixth of His Name,

全境守护者 还有那一串头衔
Protector of the Realm,all of it.

丹妮莉丝是我们的女王 可她不该是
Daenerys is our queen. She shouldn't be.

你这是叛国 我这是说出真相
That's treason. It's the truth.

你能为保护子民而放弃王位
You gave up your crown to save your people.

她会这样做吗? 
Would she do the same?

退后 他有蓝眼睛!
Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

我的眼睛一直是蓝的!
I've always had blue eyes!

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人指挥官

他的大军已在我们和临冬城之间 我们只能徒步
His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.

我们是从黑城堡骑马来的
We rode down from Castle Black.

我们可以加倍骑行
We can double up on the horses.

如果马撑得住 我们可以赶在尸鬼大军之前抵达
If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.

只能说但愿 夜王不会先到一步
We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first.

继续前进! 往前走!
Keep moving! Straight up!

跟上! 别落后!
Stay together!Don't fall behind!

当我还是个孩子的时候 哥哥就给我讲过 一个睡前故事 关于杀害我父王的凶手
When I was a child,my brother would tell me a bedtime story, about the man who murdered our father.

还有我们未来处置那个凶手的各种手段
About all the things we would do to that man.

你根本不应该信任瑟曦
You never should have trusted Cersei.

你也不应该
You never should have either.

死神… 他有千张面孔 我很期待会会这一张
Death...  it's got many faces, I look forward to seeing this one.

只到明天的太阳升起之前
Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

在我小时候 我的哥哥会给我讲睡前故事 故事是关于一个杀害了我们父王的人
When I was a child,my brother would tell me a bedtime story...  about the man who murdered our father.

他从背后刺中父王 割破他的喉咙
Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat.

他坐在铁王座上 眼睁睁看着 父王的鲜血在地上流淌
Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.

哥哥还给我讲过其他故事
He told me other stories as well.

说到我们夺回七大王国之后 这个人落入我们手中时 处置他的种种方式
About all the things we would do to that man...  once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.

你姐姐承诺过派兵来北方
Your sister pledged to send her army north.

我只看到一个人 还只有一只手
I see one man, with one hand.

看来你姐姐骗了我
It appears your sister lied to me.

她也骗了我
She lied to me as well.

她从未想过派兵北上
She never had any intention of sending her army north.

她有了攸伦・葛雷乔伊的舰队和两万名精兵
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 女王之手

她花钱雇佣来的 厄斯索斯的黄金团
The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for.

即使我们击败了尸鬼大军 她仍有足够的兵力击溃幸存的人
Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.

我发誓要为生者战斗
I promised to fight for the living.

我希望能恪守誓言
I intend to keep that promise.

陛下 我是了解我哥哥的 就像了解你姐姐那样深? 
Your Grace,I know my brother... Like you knew your sister?

他独自北上 很清楚自己会受到怎样的对待
He came here alone,knowing full well how he'd be received.

如果他刚才说的不是实情 那他还何必如此? 
Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?

大概是相信在他割破我的喉咙前 弟弟会一直为自己辩护吧
Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.

您是对的 我们不能轻信他
You're right.We can't trust him.

珊莎・史塔克
临冬城公爵夫人

他曾当街袭击我的父亲
He attacked my father in the streets.

他想让我们家破人亡 所做之恶不比对您家族的少
He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.

你想让我道歉么? 
Do you want me to apologize?

我的所作所为 都是为了我的家族 我的家人
Everything I did, I did for my house and my family.

想想我们为爱都做了什么
The things we do for love.

那为什么你现在抛弃了你的家族和家人呢? 
So why have you abandoned your house and family now?

因为现在已经不是忠于谁的问题了
Because this goes beyond loyalty.

现在关乎的是生死
This is about survival.

陛下 您不怎么了解我
You don't know me well, Your Grace.

但我了解詹姆爵士
But I know Ser Jaime.

他是个有荣誉感的人
He is a man of honor.

我曾俘虏过他
I was his captor once.

但是后来我们遭到绑架 当那帮人企图强奸我的时候
But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me,

詹姆爵士保护了我
Ser Jaime defended me.

还因此失去一只手
And lost his hand because of it.

夫人 没有他您可能就活不成了
Without him, my lady, you would not be alive.

他给了我武器和盔甲 派我去追踪您的下落 带您回家 因为他向您母亲发过誓
He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.

你会和他并肩作战么? 
You would fight beside him?

我将性命托付于你
I trust you with my life.

若你也敢托付给他 那我们应当接纳他
If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.

北境守护意下如何? 
What does the Warden of the North say about it?

我们需要尽可能地招揽人手
We need every man we can get.

谢谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

你是不是知道瑟曦在撒谎 还帮她圆谎 还是说你压根就不知道我们被骗了
Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all.

反正你要么是个叛徒 要么是个傻子
Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.

我是傻子 也不是第一回了
I was a fool. Not for the first time.

瑟曦还坐在那王座上
Cersei still sits on the throne.

如果你不能帮我夺回来
If you can't help me take it back,

首相我就另找高明
I'll find another Hand who can.

我估计战事结束前 这首相徽章的主人 就要从你俩当中选了
I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.

煤运到啦
Coal's coming through.

你就没别的事可干了么? 
Don't you have something better to do?

我的武器你做好没? 
You make my weapon yet?

等我弄完手头几千把这玩意儿就动手
Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.

你应该先给我造
You should make mine first.

还要确保比这个再结实点
And make sure it's stronger than this.

你知道吧 下到墓窖里会更安全的
It's going to be safer down in the crypt,you know.

你要去墓窖么? 
Are you going to be down in the crypt?

不去 但 但你是个战士
No, but... But you're a fighter.

连铁匠学徒都可以应付'非常可怕'的怪物呢
Even a smith's apprentice can do better than 'really bad.'

它们到底长什么样? 身上什么味道? 
What do they look like? What do they smell like?

怎么行动? 彻底弄死它们有多难? 
How do they move? How hard are they to kill?

你听好 我知道你想战斗
Look, I know you want to fight.

知道你不怕什么强奸犯 杀人狂…
And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or...

但这次不一样 这次…
This is different. This is...

你不是想知道它们什么样么? 就是死亡的样子
You want to know what they're like? Death.

死亡 死神 反正就是那副模样
That's what they're like.

很期待见见他这一张脸呢
I look forward to seeing this one.

我的武器呢? 这就动手
My weapon? I'll get right on it.

我很抱歉把你推下塔楼
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

你当初并无歉意
You weren't sorry then.

你在维护自己的家人
You were protecting your family.

我已经不是那样的人了
I'm not that person anymore.

如果不是你当初把我推下去 你现在依旧是那样的人
You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window.

而我可能还是布兰登・史塔克
And I would still be Brandon Stark.

我现在是另一种存在
I'm something else now.

你不怪我
You're not angry at me.

我不怪任何人
I'm not angry at anyone.

你为什么没有告诉他们 是我推的你? 
Why didn't you tell them?

如果我让他们先杀了你 你就不能在这场大战中助我们一臂之力了
You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.

那大战之后呢? 
What about afterwards?

你怎么知道我们能活到大战之后? 
How do you know there is an afterwards?

在地上做个记号!
Put a marker in the ground!

把它送到城墙上去
Bring it up to the wall!

好的 送到城墙上去
Up to the wall. All right.

好的 好的
All right. All right.

而且民众喜闻乐见
And the masses rejoice.

他们怎么看待他们的新女王? 
How do they feel about their new queen?

她也是你的新女王
She's your new queen too.

他们记得上次坦格利安家族 带着龙北上时 发生过什么
They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north.

一旦他们发现丹妮莉丝与她的祖先不一样 他们会回心转意的
They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.

那她真的是吗? 不一样? 
And she is? Different?

你这么相信她? 是的
You're sure about her? I am.

她似乎没有那么相信你
She didn't seem sure about you.

这不怪她
It's hard to blame her.

我犯了一个在聪明人看来愚不可及的错误
I made a mistake common to clever people.

我低估了我的敌人 嗯
I underestimated my opponents. Hmm.

瑟曦告诉我这次怀孕改变了她
Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her.

她说这是一个让你们俩都重新开始的契机
A chance for you both to start again.

那个东西可以移到角落去
That stuff can go on the end.

怀孕这事也是她捏造的吗? 
Was she lying about the baby too?

不 那个倒是真的
No, that part is real.

她一直很擅长利用事实来编造谎话
She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies.

我不会苛责你
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

她把我骗得最苦
She's fooled me more than anybody.

不 他就在那儿
No, he's right there.

她从来没有欺骗过你
She never fooled you.

你一直都很清楚她是怎样的人 但你依然爱她
You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.

… 我们会死在临冬城
...we're going to die at Winterfell.

这不是我原本计划的死法
Not the death I would've chosen.

我一直想象我 80 岁的时候 躺在自己床上 行将就木 喝饱了酒 还有… 一个姑娘 帮你吹箫 帮我吹箫
I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and  ...a girl's mouth around your cock. around my cock.

至少瑟曦无法亲手杀死我
At least Cersei won't get to murder me.

当我正被尸鬼撕碎的时候 想到剥夺了她这一乐趣 肯定会感到某种满足
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

或许等我死了以后…
Maybe after I'm dead...

我会南下进军君临城 然后撕碎瑟曦
I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.

你们会看到尸鬼大军
You will see the Army of the Dead.

他进步很大  凑合吧
He's come a long way. He's all right.

再来一次 快点
One more time. Come on.

需要学习的还很多 你肯定会教他的
Still has a lot to learn. I'm sure you'll teach him.

我听说你将指挥左翼部队
I've been told you're commanding the left flank.

这个 呃… 地形不错
It's, uh... It's good ground.

那个斜坡 会对我们有利
The rise, it should give us some advantage.

如果我们能保持紧密的队形 我们或许有机会击退他们
If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.

是 你说的对
Yes, I think you're right.

你怎么回事?  什么? 
What are you doing? What?

我想你应该知道 我真的不知道
I think you know. I truly don't.

我们从来没有哪次交谈 这么半天了你都没侮辱我 一次也没有
We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.

你希望我侮辱你? 
You want me to insult you?

我到临冬城是因为…
I came to Winterfell because...

虽然我不是从前那样优秀的战士了
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

但如果能在你的指挥下战斗 我会倍感荣耀 如果你愿意接纳我的话
But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.

抱歉 卡丽熙
Forgive me, khaleesi.

你做了什么冒犯我的事? 
Have you done something to offend me?

很久就原谅了以前的事
Long ago and long forgiven.

但就算我犯下过失 你仍然原谅了我
But you did forgive, despite my failures.

当我听说你任命了提利昂为御前首相 我的心都碎了
When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.

我任命他为首相的时候
When I named him Hand,

并不知道我能否再见到你
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

你做出了正确的选择
You made the right choice.

在我的印象中 你不是很喜欢他
I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.

我们从瓦兰提斯到弥林那一路上 他一直喋喋不休
His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen.

我强忍着才没将他丢进海里
It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.

但在那些油腔滑调背后 他的聪明才智…
But the mind behind all those words...

他有自己的过失 然后从中吸取教训
He owns his and learns from them.

你在建议我宽恕 那个抢占你位置的人? 
You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?

如果您允许的话 我还有一个谏言
And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.

等到所有步兵都被调派到战场上 我们就应该马上关闭城门
The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.

尽你的全力让城门多开一会
Keep them open for as long as you can.

还有人正从郊外逃难而来
There are still people coming in from the countryside.

约恩・罗伊斯
'青铜' 谷地领主

珊莎夫人 我希望我们可以私下谈谈
Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.

我之前本以为 就快和你达成共识了
I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before.

布蕾妮一直对我很忠诚
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.

她是我最信任的人
I trust her more than anyone.

我真希望我也能如此信任我的顾问
I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.

提利昂是个好人
Tyrion is a good man.

他对我一向彬彬有礼
He was never anything but decent towards me.

我任命他为首相 不仅仅是因为他是个好人
I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.

我任命他为我的首相 是因为他是个有头脑的好人 而且必要时 他也会变得无情
I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be.

他一开始就不应该相信瑟曦
He never should have trusted Cersei.

您也不应该相信她
You never should have either.

我以为他了解他的姐姐
I thought he knew his sister.

家家有本难念的经
Families are complicated.

我家也是如此
Ours certainly have been.

可悲的共同点
A sad thing to have in common.

我们两个还有其他的共同点
We have other things in common.

我们都知道作为女性领导者的艰难 领导那些不愿意屈服于女人的人
We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule.

而且在我来看 我们都做得很好
And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.

尽管如此 我还是感受到我们之间有些不睦
And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another.

他爱您 您是知道的
He loves you, you know that.

男人会为女人做蠢事
Men do stupid things for women.

他们很容易受女人摆布
They're easily manipulated.

我这一生只有一个目标 铁王座
All my life, I've known one goal: the Iron Throne.

我要把它从毁掉我家族的敌人手里夺回来 这个敌人也几乎毁掉你的家族
Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family,and almost destroyed yours.

我只与他们为敌
My war was against them.

如今我在这里 在半个世界之外 在琼恩的战争中与他并肩作战
Now I'm here, half a world away, fighting Jon's war alongside him.

你来告诉我 到底是谁受谁的摆布? 
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

你当初一抵达临冬城时我就应该向您表示感谢
I should have thanked you the moment you arrived.

我如今在这里 是因为我爱上了你哥哥… 因为我相信他… 也因为我知道他是个恪守承诺的人
I'm here because I love your brother...  and I trust him...  and I know he's true to his word.

他是我生命中仅有的第二个男人
He's only the second man in my life

我可以这么说
I can say that about.

那么之后呢? 
And what happens afterwards?

当我们消灭了尸鬼大军 打败了瑟曦
We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.

我夺回铁王座
I take the Iron Throne.

那么北境呢? 
What about the North?

敌人从我们手中夺走北境 我们又亲手将它夺回
It was taken from us, and we took it back.

我们也曾说过 北境永远不再向任何人俯首称臣
And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again.

到时候 您将如何处置北境? 
What about the North?

抱歉打扰了  夫人 陛下…
Apologies, my lady.Your Grace...

她只剩下了几艘船 也没法把船开来这里
She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here.

所以她去了铁群岛 她将以您的名义夺回铁群岛
So she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.

你为什么没有和她一起回去? 
But why aren't you with her?

我想为临冬城作战 珊莎公爵夫人… 如果您允许的话
I want to fight for Winterfell,Lady Sansa...  if you'll have me.

大人 我们不是当兵的
Milord, we're not soldiers.

听着 我活了大半辈子 连战场的边儿都没蹭到 但是我在私生子之战里活下来了
Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards.

就在那道城墙之外
Right outside these walls.

既然我能从那儿活下来 你们也能活下去
If I can live through that,you can live through this.

他们会在锻造处给你们武器和装备
They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge.

当大战来临时 你们在墓窖里躲好
When the time comes,you'll be down in the crypts.

那里是最安全的地方
They're the safest place to be.

穿过那扇拱门就是了
Through that archway right over there.

喂 喂 下一个是谁 小伙子们? 
Hey, hey, who's next, lads?

谢谢您 大人 回来!
Thank you, sir.Come back!

我应该往哪边去? 
Which way should I go?

你想去哪边? 
Which way do you want to go?

所有的孩子到时候 都会待在墓窖里
All the children will be going below when the time comes.

但是我的两个哥哥曾经都是战士
But both me brothers were soldiers.

到时候我会和我的儿子一起待在墓窖里 如果能和你待在一起 有你保护我们 我会感到更安全 很多人都会这样觉得
I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.I'm sure a lot of people would.

好呀 那我就去保护墓窖里的人
All right.I'll defend the crypt, then.

艾迪森・托勒特
'忧郁的艾迪' 守夜人指挥官

我以为你死了
I thought we'd lost you.

把它们拉到马厩里去
Put them in the stables.

你们怎么碰到一起的? 
How did you find each other?

我们在最后壁炉城碰面
We met up at the Last Hearth.

但是尸鬼大军先我们一步
The dead got there first.

现在为夜王而战了
Fighting for the Night King now.

我们得绕过他们才回到这里
We had to travel around them to get here.

目前没在这儿的人 都成了他们的一员
Whoever's not here now is with them.

只到明早太阳升起之前
Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

大个子女人还在这儿吗? 
The big woman still here?

我们有龙晶 和瓦雷利亚钢
We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.

但它们的数量众多
But there are too many of them.

我们的敌人不知疲倦
Our enemy doesn't tire.

与它们硬碰硬的话我们没有胜算
We can't beat them in a straight fight.

它们都是被夜王转化的 听他的指挥
The Night King made them all.They follow his command.

干掉他应该是我们最好的机会
Getting to him may be our best chance.

如果这是真的 他绝对不会露面
If that's true,he'll never expose himself.

他先前试过很多次  找到过很多三眼乌鸦
He's tried before, many times,with many ThreeEyed Ravens.

他想抹去这个世界 而我是这个世界的记忆
He wants to erase this world,and I am its memory.

那就是死亡的意义了 不是吗
That's what death is,isn't it?

如果我们忘记了我们去过何地 做过何事 我们就不再是人了
If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore.

你的记忆并不来自于书籍
Your memories don't come from books.

你的经历也不仅仅是简单的故事
Your stories aren't just stories.

如果我想抹除人类世界
If I wanted to erase the world of men,

夜王怎样能找到你? 
How will he find you?

他一直都知道我在哪
He always knows where I am.

我们会把你安置在墓窖中 那里是最安全的 不
We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest. No.

我们需要在他的军队彻底毁灭我们之前 把他引诱到开阔地带
We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all.

我会在神木林等着他
I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

你想让我们把你当作诱饵? 
You want us to use you as bait?

我们不会把你自己扔在那里
We're not leaving you alone out there.

他不是一个人 我会和他在一起
He won't be. I'll stay with him.

我曾经从你手中夺走了这座城堡
I took this castle from you.

现在就让我来守护你
Let me defend you now.

我们会尽可能拖住其余的亡者大军
We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.

我和戴佛斯爵士会在城墙上 给你们点燃战壕的信号
Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.

戴佛斯爵士完全可以自己挥舞火把
Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.

你就待在地窖里
You'll be in the crypt.

陛下 我也曾参加过战斗
Your Grace, I have fought before,

与那些冒着生命危险的 男人和女人们一同战斗
Alongside the men and women risking their lives.

他们有成千上万人 可你只有一个
There are thousands of them and only one of you.

你不能像他们一样勇猛地战斗 但你思考起来比他们都厉害
You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them.

你在这里是因为你机智过人
You're here because of your mind.

如果我们幸存下来 我还需要你的智慧
If we survive, I'll need it.

在战场上 巨龙应该能给我们带来一些优势
The dragons should give us an edge in the field.

如果巨龙在战场上 它们就没法保护布兰
If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran.

我们得离布兰近一点
We need to be near him.

不能太近 否则夜王就不会来了
Not too near, or the Night King won't come.

但要近到可以在夜王过来时追上他
But close enough to pursue him when he does.

龙焰能够挡住夜王吗? 
Dragonfire will stop him?

我们都快要死了
We're all going to die.

但至少我们死在了一起
But at least we die together.

你经历了一段奇异的旅程
You've had a strange journey.

我想听听这段故事
I'd like to hear about it.

刚好我们被困在城堡里… 在凛冬 无处可去
If only we were trapped in a castle...  in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.

当丹妮莉丝夺得王位后… 这里就没有我们的容身之处了
When Daenerys takes her throne...  there will be no place for us here.

我效忠我的女王
I am loyal to my queen.

我会为她战斗 直到她的敌人被打败 但当战争结束 她获胜后… 你想在这个地方一直到老吗? 
I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won...  do you want to grow old in this place?

你有没有其它想做的事情 或者其它想去看看的地方? 
Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?

我想再去看看那些海滩
I'd like to see the beaches again.

那我一定会带你去纳斯岛
Then I will take you there.

我家那里的人们都很温和
My people are peaceful.

我们都不能保护自己
We cannot protect ourselves.

我的族人可不温和
My people are not peaceful.

你告诉她了吗? 
Have you told her yet?

等待 完美的…
Waiting for the perfect...

我们从今开始守望
And now our watch begins.

他们在墓窖里会很安全
They'll be safe down in the crypt.

如果你想和他们在一起…
If you want to join them...

看来所有人都忘了 我是第一个杀死异鬼的人
Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker.

我杀了特恩斯  是特恩
I've killed Thenns. Thenn.

我不止一次救过吉莉
I've saved Gilly more than once.

我从学城的图书馆里 偷走过很多很多书 我还从先民拳峰活了下来
I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men.

你们这里需要我
You need me out there.

如果真到了这个地步 我们真的被他妈的搞砸了.  好吧, 叫你'他妈的' 不是很精确
Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked. Well, calling you 'fucked' wouldn't be strictly accurate.

异鬼杀手
Slayer of White Walkers.

这些征兆就足以表明 这个世界要完蛋了

我真希望父亲也在这里

我很想看看他脸上的表情 当他意识到他的两个儿子 都将为了保护临冬城而死去

一切都是那么简单

我还在和我姐姐上床 而你在这世上还只有一个朋友 一个和他姐姐上床的朋友
I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.

我是说比现在要简单一些
I was speaking in relative terms.

你怀念那段时光吗?  我当然怀念了
Do you miss it? Of course I miss it.

不过 对我来说 黄金雄狮的日子已经过去了 而对你来说 和妓女鬼混的毛病也许还在
Well, my goldenlion days are done, but whoremongering is still an option for you.

正是因为我变得专情 才闹出那样的事
Things would be easier if it were.

敬自我完善带来的危害
The perils of selfbetterment.

哦 我们不是有意打扰
Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

我们只是找个暖和地方来…
We were just looking for somewhere warm to...

思考即将到来的死亡
To contemplate your imminent death.

那你可来对了地方
You've come to the right place.

要来口马尿吗? 味道还凑合
You want some of this piss? It's not bad.

可也没多好 谢谢 大人
It's not good either. Thank you, milord.

我觉得这不太明智
I don't think that's wise.

战斗随时可能打响
The battle might start at any moment.

你呢?  不用 谢谢
And you? No, thank you.

我应该试着睡会儿
I should try and get some sleep.

你真觉得今晚有人睡得着吗
You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight?

看啊, 我们这儿有什么
Well, what do we have here?

不 我不用了 谢谢
No, none for me, thanks.

我想我在外边冻掉卵蛋也是等死 在这里温暖舒适也是等死
I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.

这可能是我们在世的最后一晚了, 你说呢? 
It could be our last night in this world, you know.

是啊 嗯 我很高兴你在这里

和我们并肩作战
Here fighting with us.

当她醒来时, 你知道她做了什么?

以为我是她的孩子
Thought I was her baby.

所以我才这么强壮
That's how I got so strong.

听得我也想喝一杯了
Maybe I will have that drink.

你以前总说个不停
You never used to shut up.

现在你只是坐在那里像个哑巴

你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing up here?

不, 我是问, 你来这里做什么

你加入了兄弟会
You joined the Brotherhood.

你去了长城外和琼恩
You went beyond the Wall with Jon.

你又在这儿 为什么? 
You're here now. Why?

你最后一次为别人而战是什么时候? 
When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?

我曾为你而战 不是吗
I fought for you, didn't I?

这还不如参加血色婚礼
May as well be at a bloody wedding.

很高兴再次见到你
It's good to see you again.

很抱歉 上次我们分别时很不愉快
I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

光之王终究还是让我们相聚了
The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same.

当光…  索罗斯都已经不在了 劝你别再布道了
When light... Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon.

如果你继续的话 光之王可能会后悔救回你 19 次 难道就为了看你被我扔到那破墙外头摔死吗
Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.

我可不想跟你们两个窝囊废一起度过最后时刻
I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.

上次你见我的时候 你就想让我来临冬城

虽然绕了些远路 但…
Took the long road, but...

红袍女想要你做什么
What did the Red Woman want with you?

她想用我的血做法术
She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.

我是劳勃・拜拉席恩的私生子
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

直到红袍女告诉我我才知道
I didn't know until she told me.

然后她把我捆起来 扒光我的衣服 让水蛭爬满我全身
Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.

那是你的第一次吗
Was that your first time?

不, 好吧, 从来没有水蛭爬到我下面
No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.

你第一次和女人在一起
Your first time with a woman.

我…  我没有… 我没跟她睡
I... I didn't... I wasn't with her.

在君临呢 你睡过别的姑娘吗? 
Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?

二十个?  好吧, 我没数过
Twenty? Well, I didn't keep count.

我们可能很快就要死了
We're probably going to die soon.

死之前我想知道那是什么感觉
I want to know what it's like before that happens.

我不是红袍女
I'm not the Red Woman.

你自己脱裤子吧
Take your own bloody pants off.

这种很奇怪 是不是
It's strange, isn't it?

几乎在座所有人都曾经和史塔克家族打过仗
Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another.

伊耿・坦格利安五世国王的长子邓肯・坦格利安游历河间地时偶遇简妮. 

简妮和她的鬼魂们翩翩起舞
Jenny would dance With her ghosts

那些她失去的人 她得到的人
The ones she had lost And the ones she had found

那些曾深爱过她的人
And the ones Who had loved her the most

为她着迷的邓肯娶了她, 为此放弃王位, 甘愿让位给长弟杰赫里斯; 
后来邓肯王子死在盛夏厅的悲剧中. 两人的爱情故事及悲剧收场被歌手, 说书人和少女传颂. 

那些已经离开

带走她的悲伤和痛楚
Spun away all her sorrow And pain

从此她再也不想离去

会把钱施舍给可怜的孩子
Gave money to poor children.

他们秘密结婚了

雷加在三叉戟河战败后 她生了一个儿子
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son.

如果被人发现 劳勃肯定会杀掉这个婴儿 莱安娜知道这点

所以她做的最后一件事就是… 在那被血染红的床上 难产而死之前 她将这个男孩托付给了她哥哥…

我的名字… 我真正的名字… 是伊耿・坦格利安
My name...  my real name...  is Aegon Targaryen.

这不可能 我也希望这不是真的

He saw it. He saw it?

然后山姆威尔证实了这件事
And Samwell confirmed it.

他在学城读到了这个秘密婚礼 甚至不知道这意味着什么
He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.

这是个全世界没人知道的秘密… 除了你弟弟和你最好的朋友

这看上去难道不奇怪吗? 
Doesn't seem strange to you?

如果这是真的 那你就是坦格利安家族最后的男性继承人
If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen.

你将拥有铁王座的继承权

反正都已经在墓窖里了
At least we're already in a crypt.

如果我们在上面 或许还能看到其他人忽略的东西
If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing.

也许就能扭转局面
Something that makes a difference.

记得黑水河之战吗? 
Remember the Battle of Blackwater?

是我带着大家冲出了烂泥门
I brought us through the Mud Gate.

然后你的脸就被一劈两半
And got your face cut in half.

但我扭转了局势
And it made a difference.

如果此刻我在外面…
If I was out there right now...

你什么忙都帮不上
There's nothing you can do.

你可能对我的长途跋涉感到惊讶 为了不加入尸鬼大军
You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.

我认为没有哪个组织不适合我的才能
I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.

俏皮话可没办法扭转局势
Witty remarks won't make a difference.

这就是为什么我们在这, 我们无能为力
That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything.

我们现在能做的最英勇的事 就是直面事实
It's the most heroic thing we can do now...  look the truth in the face.

也许该继续我们的婚姻
Maybe we should have stayed married.

你是他们中最好的
You were the best of them.

你这想法太可怕了
What a terrifying thought.

我们俩成不了的
It wouldn't work between us.

如果你一心二用, 将成为大问题
Your divided loyalties would become a problem.

没有龙女王 就没问题了
Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all.

因为我们早都死了
We'd all be dead already.

现在目的已实现
Now that purpose has been served.

你说我们还会再见
You said we'd meet again.

在世界末日前夕
At the end of the world.

你还说我会让很多人闭上双眼
You said I'd shut many eyes forever.

这个你也说对了
You were right about that too.

棕眼睛… 绿眼睛… 还有蓝眼睛
Brown eyes...  green eyes...  and blue eyes.

我们应该对死神说什么? 
What do we say to the God of Death?

一定要射准
Make every shot count.

我们已经打赢了生死之战
We have won the Great War.

现在 我们将拿下最后一战
Now, we will win the last war.

It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory...  for those who come after us...  and those who come after them...  for as long as men draw breath.

詹德利
'大牛' 劳勃国王的私生子

你还能闻到燃烧的尸体 而你脑筋却在那里
You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at.

我只是想感谢她  你当然很感激
I just want to thank her forI'm sure you do.

拜托, 不是为了那事
Look, it's not about that.

当然为那事 你傻了
Of course it's about that, you twat.

尸鬼大军都死了, 你还活着
The dead are dead. You're not.

这是正确的, 不是吗? 
That's right, isn't it?

你是劳勃·拜拉席恩的儿子
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

你可知道他夺走了我家族王位 还试图杀死我? 
You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?

我在他去世之前甚至不知道他是我父亲
I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.

他的兄弟们也是
His brothers are too.

所以现在谁是风息堡公爵? 
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

我不知道, 陛下
I don't know, Your Grace.

我觉得你应该成为风息堡公爵
I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.

不, 你是风息堡公爵, 詹德利·拜拉席恩 劳勃·拜拉席恩的合法子嗣
No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

因为这就是我让你做的

敬风息堡公爵 詹德利·拜拉席恩
To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.

That's easy, isn't it?

合理的封赏给英雄, 呃 等等
A fitting reward for a hero. Uh, hold on.

和一位永远忠于你的风息堡公爵
And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.

你不是唯一的聪明人
You're not the only one who's clever.

我得再下去拿一桶
I have to go down and get another barrel.

我们打赢了尸鬼, 还能活着讨论它
We fought dead things and lived to talk about it.

如果现在不喝酒, 什么时候? 
If this isn't the time to drink, when is?

上次我见到她的时候
The last time I saw her,

我告诉她再见面时一定会杀了她
I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

你一定有你的理由  我确实有
I'm sure you had your reasons. I did.

没给我机会

她自己了断了
She did it to herself.

也有可能是她的神了结了她
Or her god did it to her.

我们参与着他的游戏 为他战斗并且取得胜利 然后 他就滚蛋了
We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off.

没有神迹 也没有赐福 鬼知道他到底想要什么? 
No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?

还是不要考虑这种事了 你才能开心起来
I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.

要是我原本就不想开心呢? 
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

我们纵然打败了异鬼 但还得和自己人斗
We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.

谢谢你, 我感觉好多了
Thank you. I feel much better.

比我给你设计的马鞍还强
Even better than the saddle I designed for you.

这是 120 年前 戴伦·坦格利安 为他残废的侄子打造的同款
It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

你比任何人都了解历史
You know our history better than anyone.

要成为临冬城公爵的话这些知识会很有用
That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

我不是临冬城公爵
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

但你是奈德·史塔克唯一活着的亲生儿子
You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

我其实什么都不想要
I don't really want anymore.

你没必要羡慕我
You shouldn't envy me.

我基本上活在过去
Mostly I live in the past.

不行 喝不了 赶紧的 相信你可以
No, not in one go. Go on. I believe in you.

为胜利而狂欢
We have to celebrate our victory.

呕吐可不是狂欢
Vomiting is not celebrating.

敬艾莉亚·史塔克 临冬城的英雄!
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

喝! 喝! 喝! 喝! 干了!
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Drink!

你是家中独生子女
You are an only child.

我以前告诉过你 你可没
I told you I was. You didn't.

我说过了 我自己猜的
I did. I surmised it.

为什么他就可以再来一次? 
Why does he get to go again?

因为规矩是我的定的
Because it's my game.

你跟蓝礼·拜拉席恩共舞过
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

换种方式说!
The other way around!

我亲眼看见过他骑着那大家伙
I saw him riding that thing.

是我亲眼看见他骑着那大家伙的
I saw him riding that thing.

行, 是你看见的  当然是我
That's right, you did. I did.

我们愿跟着他
That's why we all agreed to follow him.

他就是那种人
That's the kind of man he is.

强大到令敌人折服 甚至因此被杀!
Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it!

大多数人被杀后 就躺那儿不动了
Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.

好啦 我没什么好说的
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

啊哈! 他凯旋而归, 不断战斗
Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting.

从这出发 打到长城以北 又打回这里
Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again.

他一直战斗 勇往无前
He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

他爬上该死的龙背战斗
He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought.

什么人才会爬到该死的龙背上? 
What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon?

错了错了错了 你喝!
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

珊莎不是你第一任妻子
You were married. Before Sansa.

你在喝葡萄酒, 但你更喜欢麦芽酒!
You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!

这是对当前的陈述
That's a statement about the present.

从过去, 直到现在 你都没睡过男人
At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man.

我们成功了! 我们与那群冰冷的异鬼正面交锋
We did it! We faced those icy fucks.

直视它们的蓝眼睛 最后我们还活了下来
Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are.

现在 你们这些软蛋还敢在老子头上撒野? 
Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?

请原谅我一会儿
Please pardon me for a moment.

在那之后 这混蛋竟然来了北境 还从我身边夺走了她
And after all that, this fucker comes north and takes her from me.

就这样被抢走了
Just takes her, like that.

我可不怕你们这些野人
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

就这样吧 克里冈 是时候忘记悲伤
Well, Clegane...  it's time to drown our sorrows.

我的酒还没喝完
I'm not done with my drink.

可别忘了 为未来的日子干杯
Don't forget that. For the rest of my days.

她本来可以让你享受一段欢愉时光
She could have made you happy, for a little while.

世界上只有一件事情可以让我开心
There's only one thing that'll make me happy.

关你屁事
That's my fucking business.

以前的你甚至不敢直视我
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

那是很久以前了
That was a long time ago.

那以后, 我经历的事情比你更可怕
I've seen much worse than you since then.

听说你被强暴
Heard you were broken in.

而且他很粗暴
Heard you were broken in rough.

最后他罪有应得
And he got what he deserved.

你变了, 小小鸟
You've changed, Little Bird.

如果你跟我一起离开君临 这些就都不会发生
None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me.

没有小指头, 没有拉姆斯… 什么事都不会有
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...  none of it.

没有小指头 拉姆斯和其他人
Without Littlefinger, and Ramsay and the rest,

我一辈子都会是那只小小鸟
I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life.

现在是深夜, 又这么冷, 所有人都在庆祝
It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating.

你应该去和大家一起庆祝
You should be celebrating with them.

我不再是詹德利·河文了
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

而是詹德利·拜拉席恩 风息堡公爵
I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End.

女王赐给我的
By order of the queen.

我不知道怎么做一个领主
I don't know how to be lord of anything.

我甚至不太会用叉子
I hardly know how to use a fork.

我只知道你很美 我爱你 如果你不和我在一起 这些就都没有意义了
All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me.

做我的妻子 风息堡的公爵夫人
Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.

你会是一个很好的领主 任何淑女能嫁给你 都会很幸福
You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you.

我没喝? 在游戏时? 
I didn't drink? In the game.

我喝了, 在游戏中  这是多恩的
I drank. In the game. This is Dornish.

这不是游戏, 这只是喝酒
This is not the game. This is only drinking.

你屋里挺暖和啊
You keep it warm enough in here.

这是我到北境后最先学会的事
It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North.

让火一直烧着
Keep your fire going.

每次离开房间都要多添些柴
Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.

真勤快, 也很负责
That's very diligent. Very responsible.

住口, 你知道我第一件事
Piss off. You know the first thing

在北境学的? 
I learned in the North?

我他妈恨透了北境
I hate the fucking North.

我不想这种事发生在我身上
I don't want things growing on me.

那巨人克星托蒙德呢? 
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

你走的时候他很难过
He was very sad when you left.

你听起来是吃醋了
You sound quite jealous.

这里可热死了
It's bloody hot in here.

我在脱你衣服啊
I'm taking your shirt off.

我从没和骑士睡过
I've never slept with a knight before.

我没和任何人睡过
I've never slept with anyone before.

那你也得喝酒, 这是规矩
Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.

我不太了解乔拉爵士… 但我知道一点
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...  but I know this.

如果他能选择死亡的方式 一定会选择为你战死
If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you.

但我不能爱他
And I couldn't love him back.

不能像他想要的那样
Not the way he wanted.

不能像我爱你一样
Not the way I love you.

我希望你没告诉我真相
I wish you'd never told me.

如果我不知道, 现在就会很开心
If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.

今晚我忘记了一会儿 然后我看到他们围在你身边
Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you.

还有他们看你的眼神
I saw the way they looked at you.

以前很多人那样看过我, 但不是在这儿
So many people have looked at me that way, but never here.

在这片大陆上, 从来没有过
Never on this side of the sea.

我说过我不想要铁王座
I told you I don't want it.

他们不在乎你想不想要
It doesn't matter what you want.

之前你也不想当北境之王
You didn't want to be King in the North.

如果他们要求你称王 从我手上夺走王位呢? 
What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?

你是我的女王, 我不知道我还能说些什么
You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.

永远不告诉他们你的真实身份
Never tell them who you really are.

让你的弟弟和山姆威尔·塔利发誓保密 绝不说出去
Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else.

不然事情传出去 你根本无法控制 更不知道会有什么影响
Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people.

不管你下跪称臣多少次 你再怎么发誓, 都无济于事
No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.

我希望我们还像从前那样
I want it to be the way it was between us.

我必须告诉珊莎和艾莉亚
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

珊莎会想让我走, 然后你坐上铁王座
Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.

她不是和你一起长大的那个小女孩了
She's not the girl you grew up with.

在她目睹了这么多 遭受过这么多之后 早就不是了
Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her.

我应该告诉她们真相
I owe them the truth.

即使这会毁掉我们俩? 
Even if the truth destroys us?

我从未因为任何事求过别人… 但是我现在求你
I've never begged for anything...  but I'm begging you.

不要这么做 拜托了
Don't do this. Please.

这是不会改变的
Nothing will change that.

她们是我的家人
And they are my family.

我们可以一起生活
We can live together.

我也告诉你该怎么做了
I've just told you how.

北境军队也是
The Northmen as well.

黄金团已经到达君临 多亏了葛雷乔伊的舰队
And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

双方实力已经均等得令人烦恼了
The balance has grown distressingly even.

当人们发现我们为他们做了什么 我们拯救了他们
When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them

瑟曦会确保人们不会相信的
Cersei will make sure they don't believe it.

我们会痛击她
We will hit her hard.

我们必将她连根拔起 铲除殆尽
We will rip her out root and stem.

这次会议的议题是怎么除掉瑟曦 而不摧毁君临的登录
The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.

谢天谢地, 她的盟友在弃她而去
Thankfully,she's losing allies by the day.

雅拉·葛雷乔伊已经以女王之名 重新夺回铁群岛
Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name.

多恩的新亲王也发誓支持他
The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.

不管有多少贵族对瑟曦倒戈相向 只要她还坐在铁王座上 她就可以自称是七大王国的女王
No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

我见过君临的人们 在极度饥饿下反抗他们的国王 这还是在凛冬来临之前的事情
I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began.

给他们机会, 他们就会推翻瑟曦
Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.

我们出军包围整座城
We'll surround the city.

如果铁舰队试图往城里运输食物 龙可以消灭他们
If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them.

如果兰尼斯特军队和黄金团发动进攻 我们会在战场上打败他们
If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field.

一旦人们意识到我们只视瑟曦为敌人 她的统治就结束了
Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.

我们剩下的人马都筋疲力竭
The men we have left are exhausted.

大部分都受了伤
Many of them are wounded.

如果能给他们时间休息恢复 他们能更好地打下一场仗
They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.

你建议恢复多久? 
How long do you suggest?

我不确定 得和军官们聊聊才知道
I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers.

我来到北境和你并肩作战 这场战争也让我损失惨重
I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself.

现在该是你回报我的时候 你却想推迟
Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

那不仅是我们的人民, 也是您的
It's not just our people.It's yours.

您想让他们没准备好 就上战场? 
You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?

我给敌人的准备时间越长 他们就会越强大
The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.

北境会向七大王国的女王 遵守他们的承诺 并保持忠诚
The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

您的命令, 我们必将服从
What you command, we will obey.

那么… 既然我们达成了一致…
So...  if all are in agreement...

琼恩和戴佛斯爵士沿着国王大道 率领北境军队 以及多斯拉克人和无垢者残部的多数南下
Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.

我们小部分人先骑马到白港 然后坐船前往龙石岛 女王和她的龙与我们一路
A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.

詹姆爵士选择留在这里 作为临冬城公爵夫人的客人
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

我们已经打赢了生死之战
We have won the Great War.

现在, 我们将拿下最后一战
Now we will win the Last War.

从此七国之内 在正统的女王统治下人们将不会生活在 恐惧和残忍的压迫之中
In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen.

我们将成为异鬼, 向君临进军
We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.

艾莉亚才是杀掉夜王的人
Arya's the one that killed the Night King.

她的人为了保护临冬城送了命
Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell

我们永远不会忘记他们
And we will never forget them.

但这并不意味着我想向她俯首称臣
That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who

我曾发誓我自己和北境都效忠于她
I swore myself and the North to her cause.

需要她的军队和龙
We needed her army, her dragons.

你做了正确的选择
You did the right thing.

而我们现在正确的做法就是告诉你 我们不相信你的女王
And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.

你还不了解她  我永远都不会了解她
You don't know her yet. I'll never know her.

如果你只相信和你一起长大的人 你没法结交很多的盟友
If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies.

我不需要那么多盟友
I don't need many allies.

艾莉亚…  我们是一家人
Arya... We're family.

是最后的史塔克
The last of the Starks.

我从来都不是一个史塔克
I've never been a Stark.

你跟我们一样, 都是奈德·史塔克的孩子
You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.

不是同父异母的兄弟或是私生子哥哥
Not my halfbrother or my bastard brother.

我要告诉你们一件事
I need to tell you something.

但是你们得发誓不会告诉任何人
But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.

你得先发誓, 我才能告诉你
You have to swear it,before I tell you.

如果我连秘密是什么还不知道 我怎么能发誓? 
How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?

因为我们是一家人
Because we're family.

所以她会跟你一起留下? 
So she's going to stay here with you?

她曾发誓会保护史塔克家的姑娘们 所以…
She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so...

我很高兴你能开心
I'm happy that you're happy.

我很高兴你终于要爬上去了
I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.

你知道我等了多久才能讲大个子的笑话? 
Do you know how long I've waited to tell tallperson jokes?

敬攀上高峰
To climbing mountains.

敬攀上高峰
To climbing mountains.

她在下面喜欢什么?  什么? 
What's she like down there? What?

不关你的事
That's not your concern.

我已经好几年没碰女人了
I haven't been with a woman for years.

透露一点嘛  你是个狗
Give me a morsel. You're a dog.

我是小恶魔 我就是要知道
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

我知道你干了她
I knew you were fucking her.

一对高大的金发公子
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

就像照镜子一样
Must be like looking in the mirror.

黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

你来… 你来北境做什么? 
What are you What are you doing up North?

你拿着那个干什么
What are you doing with that?

你不是该待在南方吗
You're supposed to be south.

你们是一对镀金的傻屌
You boys are a pair of goldplated cunts.

你们知道吗?   这很没礼貌啊
Do you know that? That's a bit rude.

年复一年, 我都在铲兰尼斯特的屎 而我得到了什么好处?   你成为骑士, 多亏我
Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show? You're a knight, thanks to me.

'多亏我'? 这个头衔也很值钱 就像你哥哥的一头金毛
Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.

权力在于人们的信任
Power resides where men believe

我在努力… 我从来没打过侏儒 再说一句, 我就抽你
I'm just trying.. I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.

看, 我不信你会这样, 毕竟
See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all

你做不到, 在你最好的那天做 你这一只手的混蛋
You couldn't do it on your best day, you one handed fuck.

你的好日子已经过去
And your best days are long gone.

我没有打断你鼻子  你怎么知道? 
I did not break your nose. How do you know?

因为我像你这么高就打断过别人鼻子 我知道该那是什么声音, 现在听好
Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen.

你们老姐许诺给我奔流城
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

漂亮的大城堡, 肥沃的土地 很多言听计从的农民
Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told.

而你相信瑟曦  我知道你们老姐死定了 在看到那两条龙
And you trust Cersei— I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons.

现在, 你们的军队可能会被撕成碎片 但我还是赌你们的龙女王赢
Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win.

而我恰好是个赌徒
And it just so happens I'm a betting man.

如果瑟曦死了, 她就不能兑现承诺
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

嗯, 这酒不错, 当然, 几率会改变 如果女王之手挂掉
Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.

也许她的一些将领被接连干掉
Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one.

突然…  我能说两句吗
All of a sudden… May I speak?

为什么不? 你只有死了才能闭嘴
Why not? Only death will shut you up.

我们很久以前就达成了协议, 你还记得吗
We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?

如果有人给我钱来杀你 你会付我双倍
If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double.

奔流城的双倍是什么? 
What's double Riverrun?

你可以成为河湾地的领主
You could be Lord of the Reach.

高庭?  你疯了吗?   总比让我们死好
Highgarden? Are you mad? It's better than being dead.

他不会杀我们的
He's not going to kill us.

否则不会跟我们说这么多
He wouldn't be talking to us if

我只需要兰尼斯特兄弟中的一个活着
I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.

高庭永远不属于一个杀手
Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.

'不'?  谁是你的祖先?  那些让你的家庭富裕的人? 
No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich?

他们也不过是杀手
They were fucking cutthroats.

所有的豪族都是这样开始的, 不是吗? 
That's how all the great houses started, isn't it?

靠一个擅长杀人的混蛋白手起家
With a hard bastard who was good at killing people.

杀几百个人, 他们封你作领主
Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord.

杀几千个人, 他们拥戴你当王
Kill a few thousand, they make you king.

然后你的傻屌后代们, 都将毁了这个家族 用他们的自以为是的方式
And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.

没拿下君临之前说这些都没有意义
None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing.

我们明早启程, 进军南方
We ride south in the morning.

我们可以使用一名军官 了解城市防御系统
We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.

不, 我的战斗日已经结束
No, my fighting days are done.

但我杀人的日子还没结束, 你们懂吗
But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me?

战争结束时我会来找你们
I'll come find you when the war is done.

在那之前, 不要死
Till then, don't die.

为什么不? 他们现在都爱你
Why not? They all love you now.

用匕首刺死那个长角的混蛋肯定很爽吧
It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.

比死感觉好一点
Felt better than dying.

你打算去君临? 
You're heading to King's Landing?

我还有些事没做了断
I have some unfinished business.

我可没打算回来
I don't plan on coming back.

如果我受伤了, 你打算又让我自己等死吗? 
Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?

'大人'应该是标准的回答
'My lord' is the standard response.

你知道她爱你哥哥
You know she loves your brother.

那并不意味着她能成为一个好女王
That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.

你似乎铁了心不喜欢她
You seem determined to dislike her.

铁王座和北境 维持良好的关系 一直都是和平, 繁荣 统治的关键
A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known.

琼恩会成为北境守护 所以一段好的关系似乎是可能的
Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely.

我认为今后他不会在这里呆太久
I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.

好吧, 我想这得由他自己决定
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

要是琼恩待在首都 你就会成为北境的真正掌权者
With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North.

如果我今天离开这里的时候可以确信 你和丹妮莉丝是盟友 我会对未来更有信心
I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies.

你在担心什么?  琼恩会带着我们的军队一起走
What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him.

你们的女王还拥有她的龙
Your queen still has her dragons

她也是你的女王
She's your queen too.

你不必做她的朋友
You don't have to be her friend.

这对你的家族有什么好处?  对北境, 或者?   你害怕她
How is that in the best interest of your family, or the North, or? You're afraid of her.

每一位优秀的统治者都需要让臣民有敬畏之心
Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.

我不想让琼恩南下君临
I don't want Jon to go down there.

我家族的人去首都都没好下场
The men in my family don't do well in the capital.

不, 可你的哥哥告诉过我 他不是一个史塔克
No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark.

她的臣民爱戴她, 你已经看到了
Her people love her, you've seen that.

你看到了他们如何为她战斗
You've seen how they fight for her.

她想让世界变得更好
She wants to make the world a better place.

如果还有其他人呢
What if there's someone else?

你不打算骑龙去南方吗
You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

雷哥需要养伤
Rhaegal needs to heal.

我不能成为他的负担
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

你只有两只跳蚤那么重
You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.

我要带自由民回家了
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

我们受够了南方
We've had enough of the south.

这儿的女人不喜欢我
The women down here don't like me.

这就是北方, 你知道的
This is the North, you know.

欢迎自由民留在这儿
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

我们需要能游荡的空间
We need room to wander.

等冬天的暴风雪一停 我就带他们穿过黑城堡
I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass.

回到我们的地盘
Back where we belong.

也是它的地盘
It's where he belongs too.

冰原狼不适合待在南方
A direwolf has no place in the south.

你能带上它吗
Will you take him with you?

他在那儿会更自在些
He'll be happier up there.

我真希望能和你一起去
I wish I was going with you.

那么就  告别了
This is farewell, then.

你拥有了北境
You've got the North in you.

好吧, 黑夜越来越长 在旧镇又没有什么可做的
Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown.

只有很多书可看 所以我们
There's only so many books a person can read, so we

山姆, 我确定他知道这是怎么发生的
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

如果是个男孩, 我们想叫他琼恩
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

你是我最好的朋友
You're the best friend I ever had.

想想过去的二十年
Think of the past 20 years.

战争, 谋杀, 痛苦
The war, the murder, the misery.

全都是因为劳勃·拜拉席恩爱上一个 不爱他的人
All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back.

还有多少人知道
How many others know?

好吧, 这不再是个秘密了
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

如果现在个别人知道了, 很快就会有几百人知道
If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon.

她会失去谷地 珊莎保准会做到
She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.

不, 比这更糟
No, it's worse than that.

他的继承顺位更靠前
He has the better claim to the throne.

他不想要王位
He doesn't want the throne.

我不确定他的想法是什么
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

事实是, 他是人心所向的
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

如果我们让他们结婚 他们可以共同统治
If we marry them, they could rule together.

这可从来阻止不了一位坦格利安人
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

不, 可琼恩在临冬城长大
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

在北境娶自己的姑妈正常吗
Is marrying your aunt common in the North?

你比我更了解我们的女王
You know our queen better than I do.

你觉得她想分享王座吗
Do you think she wants to share the throne?

她可不喜欢她的权威被质疑
She does not like to have her authority questioned.

这是她和每位 君王的共同点
Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.

我担心她的精神状态
I worry about her state of mind.

我们是女王的顾问
We are advisors to the queen.

担心她的精神状态是我们的职责
Worrying about her state of mind is our job.

我们仍需拿下君临
We still have to take King's Landing.

也许瑟曦会赢 然后把我们都杀了
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

这倒能解决我们的问题
That would solve our problems.

快到小船上去!
Get to the skiff. Now!

他们又来了!
They're coming round again!

那么 我们的消息反响很好 ? 
Our message was wellreceived, then?

您的人民听说了篡夺者要来
Your people have heard the Usurper is coming.

他们很感激您对他们的保护 感激您让他们进入红堡的城墙之内
They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.

你确定龙死了? 
You're certain about the dragon?

我看着它没入海浪
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

那肯定很壮观
That must have been glorious.

这都属于您 我的女王
The glory is yours, my queen.

等战争胜利 狮子将统治大陆 海怪将会统治大海 而我们的孩子终有一天将统治这一切
When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea...  and our child shall one day rule them all.

她冲着您来了
She's coming for you.

如果她想占领城堡 她得先屠杀成千上万无辜的人
If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first.

所谓'镣铐破除者'不过如此
So much for 'the Breaker of Chains.'

我们将席卷整座城市, 我的女王
We will storm the city, my queen.

我们会杀死您的敌人, 杀死他们所有人
We will kill your enemies. All of them.

我曾向您保证, 假如我认为您犯了错误 我会直视您的眼睛并进献直言
I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake.

你看到我的孩子从空中坠落
You saw my child fall from the sky.

瑟曦必须被摧毁 但如果我们让龙和无垢者还有多斯拉克人 进攻君临 上万无辜的人会死去
Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die.

这就是瑟曦带他们进入红堡的原因
That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep.

你来到这里就是为了保护这些民众啊
These are the people you came here to protect.

我求您 陛下
I beg you, Your Grace.

不要毁了这座您想要拯救的城市
Do not destroy the city you came to save.

不要变成您一直努力打败的敌人
Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

瓦里斯大人, 你相信我们来到这里是有原因的吗
Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys?

我来到这里, 是为了从暴君手中解放这个世界
I'm here to free the world from tyrants.

这是我的宿命 我会忠于我命, 不计代价
That is my destiny...  and I will serve it, no matter the cost.

琼恩和盟军可能要两星期 才能到达君临
It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing.

与此同时, 要求瑟曦投降
In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.

让她用王位换她的命
Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.

如果有一线机会能避免屠杀 我们就应该为之努力
If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.

与瑟曦对话阻止不了屠杀
Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter.

但或许让人们看清楚也好 丹妮莉丝·塔格利安做了所有避免民众流血的努力 但瑟曦·兰尼斯特拒绝了
But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused.

当天罚降临时 他们该知道谁才是罪魁祸首
They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.

我大半辈子都在辅佐暴君
I've served tyrants most of my life.

他们都爱说宿命
They all talk about destiny.

这个女孩带着三块石头走进火中 然后带着三条龙出来了
She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons.

她怎么能不相信宿命
How could she not believe in destiny?

也许这就是问题所在
Perhaps that's the problem.

她的经历使她相信 她是命运派来拯救我们的
Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.

你又怎么知道她不是呢
And how do you know she wasn't?

那我们就要聊聊琼恩·雪诺的问题了
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

也许他实际上才是答案
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

告诉我, 你觉得谁会是更好的统治者
Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?

他不想要王位
He doesn't want the throne.

因此他才臣服
That's why he bent the knee.

你有没有想过 最好的统治者 可能恰恰是不想统治的人
Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?

我们在讨论叛国
We're discussing treason.

不要假装你没有想过
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.

我当然想过  光想想又不算叛国
Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.

他温和, 又有分寸, 而且是男性 这会让他更对维斯特洛领主们的胃口 而我们需要他们的支持
He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.

我不觉得有鸡巴就真有资格 我相信你也会同意
I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.

他是王位的继承人
And he's the heir to the throne.

没错, 因为他是个男人 恐怕鸡巴确实是重要的
Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

那我之前的提议呢? 
What about my earlier proposal?

他们可以共同统治, 作为国王和女王
They could rule together as king and queen.

她太强势
She's too strong for him.

她会迫使他服从她的意志, 正如她所做的
She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.

他可以缓和她糟糕的冲动
He could temper her worst impulses.

你喝了不少了
You're drinking quite a lot.

一个塔格利安父亲和一个史塔克母亲
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

琼恩是唯一有可能 让北境继续留在七国之内的人了
Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

你效忠过多少个国王或女王
How many kings and queens have you served?

五个? 六个? 我都数不过来了
Five? Six? I've lost count.

你一直都知道我的理由 在某一时刻 你选择一个你相信的人 然后你为之战斗
You've always known my reasons. At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.

哪怕你知道这是一个错误? 
Even if you know it's a mistake?

我相信我们的女王
I believe in our queen.

她会做出正确的选择
She'll make the right choice.

由她忠诚的谋臣辅佐
With the help of her loyal advisors.

你知道我的忠心所向
You know where my loyalty stands.

你知道我永远不会背叛国家
You know I will never betray the realm.

广阔的大陆, 几百万人的家 这几百万人中, 大多数并不在乎谁坐在铁王座上
A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.

假如错误的人坐上王座 这几百万人中 许多人会死去
Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne.

我们不知道他们的名字 但他们就像你和我一样真实存在
We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I.

他们有活着的权利
They deserve to live.

他们应该能够喂养他们的孩子
They deserve food for their children.

我将以他们的利益为重 而不计个人的得失
I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.

那 她身上会发生什么
So, what happens to her?

我已经尽可能坦诚了
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

我们每个人都有一个选择要做
Each of us has a choice to make.

我祈祷我们都能明智
I pray we choose wisely.

…她的其他顾问也一样
...as are the rest of her advisors.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊伏击了丹妮莉丝女王以及她的舰队
Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

一头龙被杀 几艘舰船被击沉
One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed,

我一直希望着能亲眼目睹他们处决你的姐姐
I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.

看来我是没这个机会了
Seems like I won't get the chance.

他们打算毁掉那座城市
They're going to destroy that city.

你打仗的时候逃跑过吗? 
Have you ever run away from a fight?

你不像是你姐姐那种人 你不是
You're not like your sister. You're not.

你人比她好多了
You're better than she is.

你是一个好人 而你救不了她
You're a good man and you can't save her.

你没必要和她一起死
You don't need to die with her.

你认为我是个好人? 
You think I'm a good man?

为了瑟曦 我把一个男孩从塔楼的窗边推下去 致使他终身残疾
I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei.

我亲手勒死了自己的堂弟 只是为了能回到瑟曦身边
I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei.

为了瑟曦 我情愿杀死奔流城里的 每一个男女老少
I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.

丹妮莉丝女王要求瑟曦无条件投降 并立即释放纳斯岛的弥桑黛
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.

瑟曦女王要求丹妮莉丝无条件投降
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender.

若她拒不从命 纳斯岛的弥桑黛将会被就地正法
If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.

科本… 你是个理智的人
Qyburn...  you're a rational man.

大人 我也是这样自夸的
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

我们今日在此有这么一个机会 也许是我们最后一次机会来阻止一场杀戮
We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.

我不忍见这城市陷入火海
I don't want to see this city burn.

我不忍听那孩子被活活烧死时发出的惨叫
I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.

是啊 那的确不是什么悦耳的声音
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

我我不想听到那声音
II don't want to hear it.

帮我拯救这座城市
Help me save this city.

大人, 我只是我们女王的喉舌而已
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.

瑟曦是七大王国的女王
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

你明白这些, 帮她弄清
You understand this. Help her understand it.

对于你说的这种事我们一无所知
We understand nothing of the sort.

你们女王的最后一条龙已经羸弱不堪
Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.

你们的军队疲惫倦怠 还有些厌战 而我们的军队则有黄金团的有力增援
Your armies are battleweary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan

我知道你不在乎你的人民
I know you don't care about your people.

你们彼此憎恶
They hate you and you hate them.

但你不是一个怪物
But you're not a monster.

我知道, 因为我亲眼所见
I know this because I've seen it.

你曾经一直深爱着自己的孩子
You've always loved your children.

胜过自己 胜过詹姆… 胜过任何东西
More than yourself, more than Jaime...  more than anything.

如果不为你自己, 也要是为你的孩子
If not for yourself, then for your child.

你的统治已终结 但这并不意味着你的生命必须结束
Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end.

并不意味着你的孩子必须死
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

如果你有任何遗言, 现在是时候了
If you have any last words, now is the time.

我们晚餐时再试试吧
We'll try again at supper.

我觉得他们在盯着我
I think they're watching me.

当然了 那是他们的职责
Of course they are. That's their job.

我和你说过什么来着玛莎? 
What have I told you, Martha?

风险越大 回报越大
The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

去吧 厨房那边找不到你会起疑的
Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
'小恶魔' 丹妮莉丝的女王之手

刚刚渡过三叉戟河
Just crossed the Trident.

他们大概两天后到达君临城外
They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.

自打我们回来之后她就没见过任何人
She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.

房门不出 水米未进
Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.

她不该一个人呆着
She shouldn't be alone.

你为她担忧 我敬佩你的怜悯之心
You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.

你难道不担心么? 
Aren't you worried for her?

我担心的是我们所有人
I'm worried for all of us.

人们常说每个坦格利安诞生之时 诸神就会抛一枚硬币 而整个世界都会屏息以待
They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.

我们北方人可不爱玩猜谜
We're not much for riddles where I'm from.

你我都明白她会采取什么行动
We both know what she's about to do.

琼恩・雪诺
伊耿・坦格利安 铁王座法理继承人

那是她该做的决定 她是我们的女王
That's her decision to make. She is our queen.

权力取决于人心 不管人们是否意识到这一点
Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.

我想要的从未改变过
All I've ever wanted.

让一个真正合适的统治者坐上铁王座
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.

她那枚硬币会哪面朝上我不得而知
I still don't know how her coin has landed.

但你那枚我已经很清楚了
But I'm quite certain about yours.

我见识过的国王和女王比这世上任何人都要多
I have known more kings and queens than any man living.

我听过他们对老百姓说的好话 也见过他们背地里干的勾当
I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows.

我也曾帮助他们实现计划 无论那有多可怕
I have furthered their designs, however horrible.

但现在我对你说的句句属实
But what I tell you now is true:

你可以做到政治清明 而她――
You will rule wisely and well, while she

有件事需要禀报您
There's something you need to know.

有人背叛了我
Someone has betrayed me.

他知道了琼恩的真实出身
He knows the truth about Jon.

因为你告诉了他
Because you told him.

珊莎透露给你
You learned from Sansa.

而她又是从琼恩口中得知的 尽管我求过他不要告诉珊莎
And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her.

所以我说… 他背叛了我
As I said...  he betrayed me.

我很庆幸珊莎告知了我
I'm glad Sansa told me.

您所要面对的所有威胁我都应该知晓
I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.

您的情报总管也应当知晓
Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.

但你先告诉了他
You spoke to him first.

没有提前向我请示
Without coming to me.

没有经过我的允许
Without asking my permission.

你以为珊莎为什么要透露给你? 
Why do you think Sansa told you?

你以为她想得到什么结果? 
What do you think she hoped to gain?

她信任我  她当然信任你
She trusts me. Yes, she trusts you.

她相信你一定会把秘密传播出去 这个秘密足以毁了你的女王
She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen.

你显然没让她失望
And you did not let her down.

我的女王 如果我辜负了您 原谅我
If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me.

但我们是出于好意
Our intentions were good.

我们的目标和您一致 那就是创造一个更美好的世界
We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us.

瓦里斯也是如此
Varys as much as anyone.

但现在这都不重要了
But it doesn't matter now.

现在不重要了
It doesn't matter now.

我希望这是我罪有应得
I hope I deserve this.

我 坦格利安家族的
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,

打碎镣铐之人 龙之母 宣判你死刑
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons...  sentence you to die.

这是我们跨过狭海时 她带来的全部东西
This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

我说过如果你告诉你妹妹 会发生什么来着? 
What did I say would happen if you told your sister?

我不想要铁王座 我告诉过瓦里斯了
I don't want it, and that's what I told him.

你妹妹背叛了你的信任
She betrayed your trust.

瓦里斯的死 她也有责任
She killed Varys as much as I did.

这对她来说是一场胜利
This was a victory for her.

现在她明白 当人们知道你的身世后 会发生什么了
Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you.

维斯特洛的人民爱你远胜过我
Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.

这里没人爱戴我
I don't have love here.

你永远都是我的女王
And you will always be my queen.

我对你而言只是如此吗? 
Is that all I am to you?

生活在这里的百姓不是你的敌人
The people who live there, they're not your enemies.

他们是无辜的 就像你在弥林解放的那些奴隶一样
They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.

在我到弥林的时候 奴隶们就已经奋起反抗并且解放了城市
In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.

任何反抗瑟曦的人 他的家族都会被株连
Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered.

你不能指望他们充英雄
You can't expect them to be heroes.

他们是人质 是啊
They're hostages. They are.

他们被暴君挟持是谁的错? 是我的错吗? 
In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?

是谁的错又有什么关系呢? 
What does it matter whose fault it is?

如果城市被焚毁 成千上万的孩子都会死去
Thousands of children will die if the city burns.

你姐姐很清楚 如何利用敌人的弱点去对抗他们
Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them.

她认为我们的仁慈就是 我们的弱点
That's what she thinks our mercy is: weakness.

我恳求您 我的女王 但是她错了
I beg you, my queen But she's wrong.

仁慈是我们的优势
Mercy is our strength.

但我们的仁慈是留给后世百姓的 他们将永远不会再被暴君挟持为人质
Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.

今晚你们就乘船前往君临 加入北境大军 如果瑟曦的追随者们 知道这一仗赢不了的话 他们会抛弃她的
Tonight you sail for King's Landing to join the Northern armies. Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost.

给他们这个机会
Give them that chance.

如果他们投降了 他们会鸣钟并且打开城门
If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.

如果您听到了钟声 求您下令停止进攻
Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.

在城外等着我
Wait for me outside the city.

到时候你会知道怎么办的
You'll know when it's time.

你哥哥想要穿越防线 被我们抓住了
Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.

看来他到最后也没有抛弃你的姐姐
It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all.

下一次你再辜负我对你的信任… 我就不会再给你机会了
The next time you fail me...  will be the last time you fail me.

后卫部队天亮前应该就会到达
The rearguard should be here by daybreak.

她想要现在就攻城
She wants to attack now.

最早也得等到天亮
Daybreak at the earliest.

你得帮我个忙
I need to ask you a favor.

你是这世上最牛逼的走私犯 对吧? 
You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?

这个忙不太好帮是么? 
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

等下 你们要去哪里? 
Ay up. Where you going?

我要去杀瑟曦女王
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

要是她杀了瑟曦 战争也就结束了
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

围城战不用打了 明天你也许就不至于战死
There won't be a siege.You might not even die tomorrow.

我需要向长官通报
I need to go talk to my captain.

去啊 向他通报
Go ahead, talk to him.

我们会说通用语
We speak the common tongue.

我想和囚犯单独呆着
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

休息一会吧 明天会很漫长
Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.

我们有令在身 要看守囚犯
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

谁下令的?  女王吗? 
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

不是 这样的话 作为女王之手 我可比下这命令的人级别高
No. Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order.

可能高很多
Probably by quite a lot.

他们怎么发现你的? 
How did they find you?

你没考虑过把它取下来吗? 
Did you consider taking it off?

瑟曦曾叫我'最蠢的兰尼斯特'
Cersei once called me 'the stupidest Lannister.'

你要回到她身边 陪她去送死
And you're going back to her, to die with her.

你之前低估她了
You've underestimated her before.

除非你能说服她 让她改变一下作战方针
Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.

在这儿很难做到
Difficult to do from here.

我哪次动摇过她的想法? 
When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?

就算不为你自己 不为她 也要为君临城的众多百姓努力 无论这些人是否无辜
If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.

说实话 我从来没有真正在乎过他们
To be honest, I never really cared much for them.

无论这些人是否无辜
Innocent or otherwise.

有一个无辜者你肯定在乎
You do care for one innocent.

她现在有理由这么做
She has a reason now.

那个孩子就是她寸步不让的理由
The child is the reason she'll never give an inch.

她做过那么多可怕的事情 都是为了她的孩子
All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children.

她也不是完全不可能打赢
It's not impossible that she'll win.

她的敌人的兵力都已损耗大半 正如她所说的那样
Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.

三条龙中的两条已经死了
Two of the three dragons are dead.

她已经扳回了劣势 君临明天一定会陷落
She's evened the odds. The city will fall tomorrow.

她有兰尼斯特大军 她有黄金团――
She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company

上次君临遭到攻击时 是我在保卫它
I defended the city last time it was attacked.

我比任何人都清楚 明天它会陷落
I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.

那看来我要死在明天了 除非我还会死得更早
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.

你们俩一起
The two of you, together.

记得我们曾经会面的地方吗 在红堡地下 存放龙头骨的地方? 
Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep?

沿着楼梯一直往下走 走到最深处
Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go.

你们就能出来 到红堡脚下的沙滩上
You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep.

那儿会有只小船等着你们
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

如果风向合适 你们就能划到潘托斯
If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos.

从铁舰队眼皮底下划船过去 开始新生活? 
Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life?

听起来比瑟曦打胜仗更不靠谱
Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war

很快那里就不会有什么铁舰队了
There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer.

如果你不这么做 你永远都见不到瑟曦了
If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.

如果成功了 就下令敲响君临所有的钟 打开城门
If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates.

这会是君临城投降的信号
That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.

我从没想过 我会报答你的帮助
I never thought I'd get to repay the favor.

记住 敲钟 开城门
Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.

你的女王会因此处决你的
Your queen will execute you for this.

如果丹妮莉丝可以不用大开杀戒 就登上王位 或许她就会仁慈地对待 帮她实现这一切的人
If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.

成千上万的无辜百姓… 和一个不是那么无辜的侏儒… 这波交易不亏
Tens of thousands of innocent lives...  one not particularly innocent dwarf...  it seems like a fair trade.

如果不是你
If it weren't for you,

我早就夭折了
I never would've survived my childhood.

你是唯一一个 没有把我当成怪物的人
You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster.

现在清理街道!
Clear the streets now!

你 过来 赶紧回屋!
And you, come on. Inside, now!

是的 朝那边走
Yes. Follow down there.

就这样 继续 快走
That's it. Go on, move it.

跟上 动起来 走起来 快点 快一点 跟上 快走
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it.

继续走 继续向前走
Keep going. Keep moving.

抓好了 抓住我的手
Hold on. Hold my hand.

维姬! 求求开门啊! 不要啊 求您开门!
Vicky! Please! No, please, sir!

开门啊! 关门!
Open the gate! Close the gate!

开门! 开开门啊!
Open it! Open the gate!

后退 听着 去试试那扇门 走 快走
Get back. Look, try that one. Go. Go.

大门现在已关闭!
The gates are locked now!

后退! 开门啊!
Get back! Open the gate!

求求您开门吧! 滚回家去!
Please open the gate! Go back to your homes!

后退! 门已经关上了!
Stay back! It's closed!

我们所需要的只是致命一击而已
All we need is one good shot.

陛下 所有的蝎弩都被毁了
The scorpions have all been destroyed, Your Grace.

铁舰队还把守着黑水湾
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.

攸伦杀了她的一条龙
Euron killed one of her dragons.

女王陛下 铁舰队已陷入火海
Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning.

城门也全部被突破
The gates have been breached.

我们的军队会比佣兵打得更卖力
Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could.

他们会保卫他们的女王 直到最后一个人倒下
They will defend their queen to the last man.

是的 女王陛下 红堡从未陷落
Yes, Your Grace. The Red Keep has never fallen.

敲钟! 敲钟啊!
Ring the bells! Ring the bells!

敲钟! 快敲钟!
Ring the bells! Ring the bells!

快他妈敲钟啊!
Ring the bloody bells!

敲钟! 敲钟!
Ring the bells! Ring the bells!

让女王敲钟
Tell the queen to ring the bells.

敲钟! 敲钟!
Ring the bells! Ring the bell!

敲钟! 救救我们!
Ring the bells! Help us!

我们投降了!
Queen! We're surrounded!

敲钟! 快敲啊!
Ring the bells! Now! Come on!

放开我! 放开 婊子! 不要 放开! 救命! 救命!
Get off me! Get off, bitch! No, get off! Help! Help!

找个地方躲起来
Find somewhere to hide.

我们要让女王离开君临
We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.

这是城市覆灭的声音
That's the sound of a city dying.

如果你在死前杀死了另一位国王 他们会永远歌颂你
If you kill another king before you die...  they'll sing about you forever.

我还操了女王
And I fucked the queen.

我会把你的脑袋带给瑟曦 这样你就可以和她吻别了
I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.

女王陛下 这里已经不再安全了
Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.

红堡是全城最安全的地方
The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.

无垢者已经攻破了红堡的大门
The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.

梅葛楼应该更安全 去那躲躲这场风暴
Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.

对一个残废来说… 你还挺能打的
You fought well...  for a cripple.

你又弑了一回君
Another king for you.

我是杀了詹姆・兰尼斯特的人
I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

她要么会被烧死 要么被多斯拉克人杀死
The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.

或者填了龙的肚子
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

都不重要了 她死定了
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

你要是再不离开这里 你也会死
And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.

我要去杀了她
I'm going to kill her.

你以为只有你一个人为复仇等了很久吗? 
You think you wanted revenge a long time?

我这辈子都在等这个机会
I've been after it all my life.

我活着只为了这个
It's all I care about.

现在看着我 看着我!
And look at me. Look at me!

你想变成我这个样子吗? 
You wanna be like me?

再跟着我 你会死在这
You come with me, you die here.

格雷果爵士 呆在我身边
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

格雷果爵士 我命令你
Ser Gregor, I command you.

服从你的女王 格雷果爵士
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

你一直都是这副丑样子

阿兰娜! 你有见到我老婆吗? 
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

你有看到我老婆吗? 
Have you seen my wife?

我们需要撤退!
We need to fall back!

撤到城墙外面去!
Fall back behind the wall!

你们要不停地逃
You have to keep moving.

我们不能出去
We can't go out there.

在外边的人都死了
Everyone out there is dead.

如果你们都躲在这里 也都会死
If you stay here, you'll die.

过来 快点 跟我来
Come on, quickly. Come to me.

所有人 动作快!
Come on, quickly. All of you!

我们得赶紧离开
We have to keep moving.

我想让我们的孩子活下去
I want our baby to live.

我想让我们的孩子活下去
I want our baby to live.

我想让我们的孩子活下去
I want our baby to live.

别让我死掉 詹姆 求你别让我死掉
Don't let me die, Jaime.Please don't let me die.

求你别让我死掉 没关系
Please don't let me die.It's all right.

看着我 我不要这样死去
Look at me.Not like this.

我不要这样死去 不要这样
Not like this. Not like this.

你看――你看着――看着我的眼睛
LookLookLook me in the eye.

别转移视线 别看其他――
Don't look away. Don't look

看着我! 你看着我就好
Look at me! Just look at me.

什么都不重要了
Nothing else matters.

什么都不重要了
Nothing else matters.

我派几个人陪你
Let me send some men with you.

以唯一女王丹妮莉丝・坦格利安之名
In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen,

我判处你们死刑
I sentence you to die.

这些人是囚犯
These men are prisoners.

直到女王的敌人都被打败才算结束
It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.

你还想让他们如何被打败? 
How much more defeated do you want them to be?

他们已经下跪臣服  可他们还活着
They're on their knees. They are breathing.

看看你周围朋友, 我们已经赢了
Look around you, friend. We won.

我只听从女王的命令, 而不是你的
I obey my queen's commands, not yours.

女王下了什么命令? 
And what are the queen's commands?

但他们选择为瑟曦而战
They chose to fight for her.

小心啊, 慢点! 慢点
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

我们应该和女王谈谈
We should speak with the queen.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
'弑君者' 瑟曦的前女王铁卫

你放走你哥哥
You freed your brother.

你犯了叛国罪
You committed treason.

而你血洗了君临
And you slaughtered a city.

你在这儿做什么? 
What are you doing here?

我是杀瑟曦的
I came to kill Cersei.

你的女王捷足先登
Your queen got there first.

现在她是七国的女王
She's everyone's queen now.

在城外等我, 我会来找你
Wait for me outside the city gates.I'll come find you.

琼恩, 她知道你是谁
Jon. She knows who you are.

你永远都是她的威胁
You'll always be a threat to her.

而我看得出谁会下毒手
And I know a killer when I see one.

你带了什么酒? 
Did you bring any wine?

那么… 谢谢你能来看我
Well...  thank you for coming to see me.

我们的女王不会关押囚犯太久
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long.

我想这是一种粗暴的正义
I suppose there's a crude kind of justice.

我背叛了我最亲密的朋友并看着他燃烧
I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn.

现在瓦里斯的骨灰对我的骨灰说: 
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

我刚刚意识到
It just occurred to me.

我正和唯一知道我要去哪里的人说话
I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.

那么死后还有来生吗? 
So is there life after death?

我应该感激
I should be thankful.

遗忘就是我希望的
Oblivion is the best I could hope for.

我勒死了我的爱人
I strangled my lover.

我用十字弓射杀了自己的父亲
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

我会再做一遍 现在我看到的这些景象
And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen.

可君临的人民不能
The people of King's Landing did not.

我无法证明发生的事情
I can't justify what happened.

但是现在战争结束了  是吗
But the war is over now. Is it?

你听到她对她的士兵们的讲话 她听起来像是一个结束战斗的人吗? 
When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?

她解放了奴隶湾的人民
She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay.

她解放了君临的人民
She liberated the people of King's Landing.

她还会继续解放 直到全世界的人们都自由的时候… 然后她来统治所有人
And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free...  and she rules them all.

但你一直在她身边辅佐她
And you've been by her side, counseling her.

自负的认为我可以引导她
It was vanity to think I could guide her.

我们女王的天性就是火与血
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

你认为族徽是打在我们身上的烙印 一出生就决定了我们的本质? 
You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are?

那我也是血与火了
Then I'd be fire and blood too.

她不是她父亲 就像你不是泰温・兰尼斯特
She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

我父亲是个邪恶的男人
My father was an evil man.

我姐姐是个邪恶的女人
My sister was an evil woman.

但就算把 他们杀过的所有人的尸体堆起来 也还没到我们美貌的女王 在一天之内屠杀的人数的一半
Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.

是瑟曦让她没得选
Cersei left her no choice.

城门陷落的那一刻 战争就结束了
The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.

她眼看着她的朋友被斩首
She saw her friend beheaded.

眼看着她的龙被击落
She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

为此她烧毁了一座城市
And she burned down a city for it.

啊, 当你站得离战场远远的 当然很容易评判对错
Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.

你会这么做吗? 
Would you have done it?

你也曾高高地骑在龙背上
You've been up there, on a dragon's back.

你也拥有过那种力量
You've had that power.

你会摧毁一个城市吗? 
Would you have burned the city down?

你不想说, 因为你不想背叛她… 但你懂得
You won't say because you don't want to betray her...  but you know.

我会怎么做又有什么关系? 
What's it matter what I'd do?

这比什么都重要
It matters more than anything.

当她杀死阿斯塔波的奴隶主们
When she murdered the slavers of Astapor,

我敢肯定除了奴隶主以外没人抱怨
I'm sure no one but the slavers complained.

毕竟, 他们是邪恶的人
After all, they were evil men.

当她对几百个弥林贵族施以酷刑 谁又能反对呢? 
When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue?

至于那些她活活烧死的多斯拉克卡奥们? 
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

他们会对她下更狠的手
They would have done worse to her.

她所过之处, 邪恶的人们死去 而我们为她欢呼
Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it.

于是她变得更加强大的同时 也更加确信她是正确与正义的化身
And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.

她相信她的使命 是为所有人建立一个更好的世界
She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone.

如果你是这样认为的… 如果你真心这样认为 你难道不会杀死 任何挡在你和你的理想国之间的人吗? 
If you believed that...  if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?

没有你那么成功
Not as successfully as you.

但我全心全意的相信她
But I believed in her with all my heart.

爱比理智更强大
Love is more powerful than reason.

你刚刚想到的? 
You just came up with that?

伊蒙师傅很早以前说的
Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

有时候为了责任应当牺牲爱
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

你是守护疆域人民的盾牌
You are the shield that guards the realms of men.

你一直都在努力做正确的事情
And you've always tried to do the right thing.

不论以何代价 你一直都在努力保护人民
No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people.

但现在谁才是人民面临的最大威胁
Who is the greatest threat to the people now?

这样问很可怕
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

但这是正确的
It's also the right thing.

你觉得我会是她处决的最后一个人吗? 
Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute?

还有谁对她来说比 铁王座的正统继承人更加危险
Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

那是她的决定, 她是女王
That's her decision. She is the queen.

我很遗憾情况变成这样
I'm sorry it came to this.

你看她们会臣服吗? 
Do you see them bending the knee?

我的姐妹们会忠诚于王座
My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

你觉得珊莎为什么会告诉我关于你的真相? 
Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you?

因为她不希望丹妮成为女王
Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.

可她没法选择  不
She doesn't get to choose. No.

而你必须抉择趁现在
And you have to choose now.

在我小女孩的时候, 哥哥告诉我 伊耿融掉了上千把降敌的剑, 才锻造成了铁王座
When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies.

一千把剑是什么样子的?  在一个不能数到二十的小女孩的脑海里? 
What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20?

我想象着仿佛小山一样高的剑堆, 难以攀爬
I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb.

那些成千上万的降敌 只能仰望伊耿的脚跟
So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.

兰尼斯特家的战俘
Lannister prisoners in the street.

据他们说是执行您的命令
They said they were acting on your orders.

这是必须的  必须的? 
It was necessary. Necessary?

你去过那里吗? 
Have you been down there?

孩子们, 年幼的孩子们, 被烧死!
Children, little children, burned!

我试图与瑟曦达成和平
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

可她却利用无辜的生命来对付我
She used their innocence as a weapon against me.

她以为这样就能削弱我
She thought it would cripple me.

他背着我勾结敌人
He conspired behind my back with my enemies.

你如何对待那些对你做过同样事情的人?  即使当它摧毁了你的心? 
How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?

你可以宽恕所有人 让他们意识到曾经犯了错
You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake.

让他们明白这点
Make them understand.

我们不能躲在小恩惠后面
We can't hide behind small mercies.

我们需要的世界 不可能由忠于旧世界的人建造
The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.

我们需要的世界是一个仁慈的世界, 它必须是
The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.

要看到从未有过的东西并不容易
It's not easy to see something that's never been before.

怎么能确信一定就是美好的? 
How do you know it'll be good?

因为我明白什么是好的
Because I know what is good.

我确信, 你一直都明白
You do. You've always known.

那其他人呢? 
What about everyone else?

他们所有人都明白什么是好的
All the other people who think they know what's good.

但他们没有选择
They don't get to choose.

和我一起开辟一个新天地
Build the new world with me.

在我们尚且年幼时就注定 那时你是带着私生子之名的男孩 而我是个连二十都数不到的女孩
It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20.

一起打破历史的车轮
We break the wheel together.

他是我们的囚犯  提利昂勋爵也是
He is our prisoner. So is Lord Tyrion.

他们都要被带到这个会议
They were both to be brought to this gathering.

我们将决定如何对待我们的囚犯
We will decide what we do with our prisoners.

现在是我们的城堡
This is our city now.

如果你看看你的城外 你会发现成千上万的北境战士 都想弄明白为什么要伤害琼恩・雪诺 这不符合你的利益
If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.

你也会看到数以万计的无垢者 会相信这些
And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.

你们中的一些人可能会很快谅解
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

可我们铁民不会
The Ironborn are not.

我发过誓, 要效忠丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

你发誓效忠的是个暴君
You swore to follow a tyrant.

她把我们从暴君手中解放出来
She freed us from a tyrant.

瑟曦因为她才不复存在 而琼恩・雪诺却一刀刺在她心上
Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.

让无垢者给他应得的下场
Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.

再提一次处决我的哥哥 我会割了你的喉咙
Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.

我们互相割喉已经够久了
We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.

灰虫子, 我说得对吗? 
Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?

如果不是你和你的部下 我们已经输给亡者大军了
If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead.

这个国家欠你们的永远无法偿还 但我们不妨试一试
This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try.

河湾地有大片土地
There is land in the Reach.

以前住在那里的人已经不在了
The people that used to live there are gone.

自力更生, 建立你自己的家族 以无垢者为你的旗帜
Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen.

我们已经打够了
We've had enough war.

你的千万人, 他们的千万人
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

你知道结局如何
You know how it ends.

我们需要找到更好的办法
We need to find a better way.

我们不要报酬
We do not need payment.

琼恩・雪诺不能被释放
Jon Snow cannot go free.

这轮不到你来决定
It's not for you to decide.

没你说话的份儿!
You are not here to speak!

大家都听够了你的话
Everyone has heard enough words from you.

没有人比这更好了
And no one's any better for it.

但确实轮不到你来决定
But it's not for you to decide.

琼恩在这里犯了罪
Jon committed his crime here.

他的命运应该由我们的国王来决定
His fate is for our king to decide.

我们没有国王或女王
We don't have a king or queen.

约恩・罗伊斯
'青铜' 谷地领主

你们是维斯特洛最有权势的人
You're the most powerful people in Westeros.

那你们就做选择吧
Make your choice, then.

大人和夫人们…
My lords and ladies...

我想这是我们人生中最重要的时刻
I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives.

我们今天的决定 将对历史产生深远的影响
What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history.

站在你们面前 作为国内资深的领主之一
I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country.

两场战争的元老
A veteran of two wars.

那么, 我们必须选出一个人
Well, we have to choose someone.

我们代表所有大家族 但无论我们选出谁 这个人并不仅仅统治贵族
We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies.

也许是关乎每个人的最好决定 这个决定应该留给… 嗯, 所有人
Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to...  well, everyone.

或许我们应该让狗也来投票
Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.

一半的人因为我效忠丹妮莉丝而憎恨我 另一半因为我背叛她而憎恨我
Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.

想不出更坏的选择了  那选谁? 
Can't think of a worse choice. Who, then?

我过去的几周除了思考没做其它事
I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks.

关于我们的血腥历史
About our bloody history.

关于我们犯的错误
About the mistakes we've made.

这世上没有什么比一个好故事 更具有力量了
There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.

没有敌人可以击败它
No enemy can defeat it.

谁的传闻能比得上… 残缺的布兰呢? 
And who has a better story...  than Bran the Broken?

他是那个从高塔上坠落却活下来了的男孩
The boy who fell from a high tower and lived.

他知道他永远无法行走, 便学会了飞翔
He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly.

一个残缺的男孩 却越过了绝境长城 并成为了三眼乌鸦
He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the ThreeEyed Raven.

他是我们的记忆 我们所有传闻的保存者
He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories.

战争, 婚礼, 出生, 屠杀, 饥荒
The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines.

我们的胜利 喔, 还有我们的失败 我们的过去
Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past.

谁能更好地带领我们走向未来? 
Who better to lead us into the future?

布兰对统治不感兴趣, 而且他不能生育
Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.

国王的儿子可能是残忍和愚蠢的 众所周知
Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know.

布兰的接班人则不会折磨我们
His will never torment us.

这正是我们的女王曾经想要打破的历史车轮
That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.

从今天开始, 统治者将不再由血统决定
From now on, rulers will not be born.

他们将在这个地方被选中 由维斯特洛的大人和夫人们… 为国家效力
They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros...  to serve the realm.

我知道你不想当国王
I know you don't want it.

我知道你不在乎权力
I know you don't care about power.

但我现在还是要问你, 如果我们选择你… 你会戴上皇冠吗? 
But I ask you now, if we choose you...  will you wear the crown?

你会尽最大努力领导七国吗?  从今天到最后一天? 
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?

你认为我为什么一路走来? 
To Brandon of House Stark...

我不确定我是否有投票权, 但我也赞成
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

我爱你, 弟弟, 我会永远支持你
I love you, little brother.I always will.

你将会是一位好国王
You'll be a good king.

但成千上万的北境子民 为了保护维斯特洛人民, 在大战中牺牲
But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros.

那些目睹了这场血雨腥风 也置身其中战斗的幸存者们很难再屈膝臣服
And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again.

北境将会保持王国独立 正如它几千年来一样
The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.

敬'残缺的'布兰一世
All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name,

安达尔人和先民的国王
King of the Andals and the First Men,

六国统治者暨全境守护者
Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

敬'残缺的'布兰!
All hail Bran the Broken!

提利昂大人… 你将是我的首相
Lord Tyrion...  you will be my Hand.

不, 陛下, 我不想要它
No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

而我也不想当国王
And I don't want to be king.

我曾以为我很明智, 但我错了
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

我曾以为我知道什么是对的, 但我错了
I thought I knew what was right,but I didn't.

我选你  你不可以
I choose you. You cannot.

我是国王  但这人有罪
I'm king. This man is a criminal.

他应当受到正义的审判  他已经受到了
He deserves justice. He just got it.

他犯下了许多可怕的错误
He's made many terrible mistakes.

他将用余生去一一偿还
He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.

把你交给无垢者会掀起一场战争
Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war.

放你自由也会掀起一场战争
Letting you walk free would start a war.

我们的新王决定 派你去当守夜人
So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.

现在还有守夜人? 
There's still a Night's Watch?

这个世界总归需要给 私生子和残废人一个容身之地
The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.

你将不娶妻 不封地 不生子
You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

无垢者当然想要你的人头 但灰虫子同意终身服刑这一判决
The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence.

珊莎和艾莉亚希望你自由 但她们也明白我们的新国王需要谋取和平
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace.

这个决定不能取悦所有人
No one is very happy.

我想这是一个很不错的妥协了
Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.

感觉不对劲
It doesn't feel right.

十年后再问我吧
Ask me again in 10 years.

我并不认为我们会再见面
I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.

我不会这么肯定
I wouldn't be so sure.

当过几年的国王之手 任谁都想要滚开这世界的边缘
A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.

我多希望还有其他解决办法
I wish there had been another way.

北方是自由的, 多谢你
The North is free, thanks to you.

但也失去了他们的国王
But they lost their king.

奈德・史塔克的女儿将会守护北境人民
Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them.

她是人民最信任的人
She's the best they could ask for.

你可以来看望我, 我就在黑城堡
You can come see me, you know,at Castle Black.

你觉得有人敢跟你说女人不许进的吗? 
You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?

我不准备回北境
I'm not going back north.

维斯特洛西边是哪里? 
What's west of Westeros?

所有地图都没有写
It's where all the maps stop.

我要去看看
That's where I'm going.

带着你的缝衣针了? 
You have your Needle?

对不起, 当你需要我的时候我没在场
I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.

你就在你应该待的地方
You were exactly where you were supposed to be.

冰与火之歌
A Song of Ice and Fire.

安布罗斯大学士撰写的战争史 从劳勃国王去世写起
Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert.

我帮他想了这个书名
I helped him with the title.

我想我会受到一些批评
I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.

哦, 我不这么想
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

哦, 他笔下留情了 没想到啊
Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed.

他说我什么了? 
What does he say about me?

我不相信你被提及  咳咳
I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.

陛下 陛下
Your Grace. Your Grace.

陛下 陛下
Your Grace. Your Grace.

看样子我们少了一名情报总管
We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers.

和一名法务大臣
And a Master of Laws.

和一名军务大臣  好的 陛下
And a Master of War. Yes, Your Grace.

合适的人选将 在接下来的几周呈送给您
Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.

卓耿呢? 有没有消息? 
And Drogon? Any word?

它最后一次被发现是向东飞去
He was last spotted flying east, toward

越远越好
The farther away, the better.

或许我能找到它
Perhaps I can find him.

你们继续
Do carry on with the rest.

遵命 陛下
As you wish, Your Grace.

我们很荣幸为您效力 '残缺的'布兰国王 六国统治者及全境守护者
We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

国王万岁 国王万岁
Long may he reign. Long may he reign.

国王万岁 国王万岁
Long may he reign. Long may he reign.

黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

河湾地的至高统领 兼财政大臣 你说国王欠你的债已经还清了吗? 
Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?

全部还清, 首相大人
In full, my lord Hand.

该开始欠下新债了
Time to start incurring a new one.

我们有饥饿的人民需要养
We have hungry people to feed.

我们能获得这方面的一些帮助吗? 
Can we expect some assistance in this regard?

戴佛斯大人, 我们需要重建一支舰队, 以及修复港口
Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.

是的, 这些项目将尽快开始 由财政大臣和崇高称号的大人提供资金的话
We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.

财政大臣期待能助海政大臣 但首先他必须确保我们不浪费硬币 否则很快我们就不有钱了
The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.

你还是语法大臣? 
You Master of Grammar now too?

大学士 咳咳 在我看来, 根据我多年对 凯岩城下水道的研究 干净的水能够带来更健康的人口
Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.

大学士已经对此做了调查 发现
The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and and it turns outa

强者生存, 弱者淘汰
The strong live and the weak don't.

找到最好的建筑工人, 让他们完成这项工作
Find the best builders and set them to the task.

哦, 提到建筑工人, 所有的好妓院都塌了
Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down.

财政大臣愿意资助它们重建
The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.

呃… 大学士并不看好 妓院带来的有益影响
Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.

好吧, 我想他大概没用对地方
Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.

我想我们全都同意 舰队比妓院重要
I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.

我认为这是一个非常傲慢的说法
I think that's a very presumptuous statement.

我曾把一个蠢货 和一个'蜂巢'带去妓院
I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
