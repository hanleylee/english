22岁的我  刚结婚    I'm 22 years old, newly married,
就已经是个追名逐利的小混蛋了    and already a money-crazed little shit.
那我怎么办呢    So what do I do?
我去了唯一一个    I go to the one place on earth

汉纳先生    Mr. Hanna,
这么美好的午后  您要来点什么    what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?
赫克托  我告诉你怎么玩    Well, Hector, here's the game plan.
给我们上两杯马丁尼    You're gonna bring us two Absolut Martinis.
你知道我的口味  要纯的    You know how I like them. Straight up.
整7分半后    And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that,
再上两杯    you're gonna bring us two more.
然后每5隔分钟上两杯    Then two more after that every five minutes
直到我俩喝倒一个为止    until one of us passes the fuck out.
这想法不错  先生    Excellent strategy, sir.
我现在喝水就好    I'm good with water for now.
谢谢    Thank you.
他今天刚来华尔街工作    It's his first day on Wall Street.
他会习惯的    Give him time.
-谢谢  -谢谢    - Thank you. - Thank you.
汉纳先生    Mr. Hanna?
你白天嗑了药    You're able to do drugs during the day
还能正常工作吗    and then still function, still do your job?
不然你以为怎么正常工作    How the fuck else would you do this job?
就凭可卡因和妓女了  哥们    Cocaine and hookers, my friend.
是    Right.
我想说    Well, I got to say,
能加入你们我真的很高兴    I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean...
你们的客户实在是...    The clients you have are absolutely...
去他妈的客户    Fuck the clients.
你唯一的职责就是引他们上钩    Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table.
你有女朋友吗    You got a girlfriend?
我结婚了    I'm married. I have a wife.
我妻子叫泰瑞莎  理发的    Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.
-恭喜  -谢谢    - Congratulations. - Thank you.
多想想泰瑞莎    Think about Teresa.
你要干的就是    Name of the game.
把你客户兜里的钱揣到你兜里    Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket.
是    Right.
但如果同时能帮客户赚钱    But if you make your clients money at the same time,
不是互惠互利吗    it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?
不    No.
华尔街第一要义    Number one rule of Wall Street.
没有人    Nobody...
不管你是沃伦·巴菲特也好    I don't care if you're Warren Buffett
吉米·巴菲特也好    or if you're Jimmy Buffett.
没人知道股票是涨是跌    Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down,
是持平还是兜圈子    sideways, or in fucking circles.
股票经纪人更不知道  懂吗    Least of all stockbrokers, right?
都是掩的  你知道什么叫掩吧    It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is?
"赝"吗  就是假的    Fugayzie. It's a fake.
什么掩啊赝啊  嫖啊飘啊的    Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...
都是虚无缥缈的  根本不存在    Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.
看不见摸不着    It's never landed. It is no matter.
元素周期表上找不到    It's not on the elemental chart.
根本都他妈是假的    It's not fucking real.
-对不  -对    - Right? - Right.
继续听我讲    Stay with me.
我们屁都不创造  什么都不建    We don't create shit. We don't build anything.
的确    No.
所以假设你有个客户花8块买了一股    So if you got a client who bought stock at eight
现在涨到16了  他乐开花了    and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy.
就想兑现清算    He wants to cash in, liquidate,
拿上钱打包走人    take his fucking money and run home.
-这可不行  -好的    - You don't let him do that. - Okay.
-因为那样就成真钱了  -是    - 'Cause that would make it real. - Right.
那该做什么    No. What do you do?
你得继续给他出金点子    You get another brilliant idea.
额外的想法    A special idea.
制造另一种"情况"    Another "situation."
让他拿收益再投一支股票  不断投    Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some.
他每次也一定会投    And he will, every single time.
因为他们全都他妈是瘾君子    'Cause they're fucking addicted.
你就一直这么干    And you just keep doing this,
延绵不断  无休无止    again and again and again.
他这时觉得自己要成土豪了    Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich,
理论上他的确赚了    which he is, on paper.
但我们这些经纪人    But you and me, the brokers,
从中收的佣金    we're taking home cold hard cash
可都是实打实的现金  学着没    via commission, motherfucker.
是    Right.
这太神奇了  老板    That's incredible, sir.
我都激动的无以言表了    I can't tell you how excited I am.
你就该兴奋    You should be.
做经纪人这行的成功要素有两点    There's two keys to success in the broker business.
首先    First of all...
-你得淡定  -是    - You gotta stay relaxed. - Yeah.
你平时撸吗    Do you jerk off?
撸...撸吗    Do I... Do I jerk off?
撸  撸啊  我当然撸    Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.
每周几次    How many times a week?
三四次吧    Like three or four.
三四次  有时五次    Three or four times, maybe five.
你得多撸啊    Gotta pump those numbers up.
干这行  你这次数太菜鸟了    Those are rookie numbers in this racket.
我本人吧  每天至少两发    I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.
早晨健身之后来一发    Once in the morning right after I work out,
午饭后再来一发    then once right after lunch.
真的吗    Really?
我喜欢撸  但我撸不是因为喜欢    I want to. That's not why I do it.
全他妈是被逼的    I do it 'cause I fucking need to.
你想想  你是跟数字打交道的    Think about it. You're dealing with numbers.
整天都是什么小数点啊  高频交易啊    All day long, decimal points, high frequencies.
全他妈是数    Fucking digits.
每天重任在肩  喘不过气啊    All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit.
对吧    All right?
太让人抓狂了  是吧    It kind of wigs some people out. Right.
所以就得多撸  保持血液流通顺畅    You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing.
私底下控制住节奏    I keep the rhythm below the belt.
懂了    Done.
我这可不是提醒你  我给你开处方呢    This is not a tip, this is a prescription.
相信我    Trust me.
你不这么干  就没法平衡了    If you don't, you will fall out of balance,
差额搞不清楚你就载了    split your differential and tip the fuck over.
还有更糟的    Or worse yet,
我亲眼见过  猝死    I've seen this happen, implode.
别介  我可不想猝死  老板    No, I don't want to implode, sir.
当然  没人想    No. No, you don't.
我干这行看得很长远的    I'm in it for the long run, you know?
-猝死可不是什么好事  -是    - Implosions are ugly. - Yeah.
所以有空就去洗手间来一发    Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can.
等你撸顺手了    When you get really good at it,
一边撸着    you'll fucking be stroking it
一边脑子里想的都是钱    and you'll be thinking about money.
干这行成功要素之二    Second key to success in this racket
就是这瓶子里的宝贝    is this little baby right here.
叫可卡因    It's called cocaine.
是    Right.
能让你耳聪目明    It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
还能让你拨号指速如飞    It'll also help your fingers dial faster.
你猜怎么着    And guess what?
你拨号快了  我就赚了    That's good for me.
好了  先生    Yes, sir.
周转不息  明白吗    Revolutions. You follow?
周转不息    Revolutions.
让客户坐上摩天轮    Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.
我们就开赚    And it goes.
游乐园365天全天候给他开着    The park is open 24/7, 365,
十年如一日  百年也他妈这样    every decade, every goddamn century.
就这么回事    That's it.
这就是游戏规则    The name of the game.
尝尝希腊橄榄    Halkidiki?
谢谢    Thank you.
一起来    Come on.
我们是公分母    We're the common denominator.
继续    Keep it up for me.
你懂这回事    You've seen the echo
我们谈着钱    And the money comes in
游行进了城    The parade comes to town
走到百老汇    Going down Broadway
不管往哪去    It's a one-way street
都没回头路    Whichever way I go
之后的六个月    The next six months,
我开始了解华尔街的门道    I got to know the ins and outs of Wall Street.
边赚小钱边准备考执照    Earning shit money as I geared up to take my Series 7.
真他妈爽    Oh, fuckers.
后来我终于拿下了执照    Then I was a licensed broker at last,
准备开始挣大钱了    ready to make my fortune.
那天起我开始向未来宇宙之王迈进    My first day as a future Master of the Universe.

我知道    Yeah, I know.
但那些投资人其实挣不到钱  对吗    But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right?
时有时无吧    Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
投资本来就是这样的    You know how it goes.
那把这种股票卖给    Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people
不在乎这点小钱的富人不会更好吗    who can, like, afford to lose all that money?
当然    Of course.
但有钱人是不会买仙股的    But rich people don't buy penny stocks.
事实就这样    They just don't.
为什么    Why not?
因为他们都混成精了    Because they're too smart, that's why not.

你得看着他们的下巴    You gotta look at their chin.
看着像是我在看你    Like it looks like I'm looking at you
但其实我在看你下巴    but I'm looking at your chin.
我感觉你在跟我说话    I feel like you're addressing me right now,
但你没在跟我说话吧    but you're not, are you?
他们就像蒙娜丽莎一样  不管你站哪里    They're like the Mona Lisa. They find eye contact,
他们都能直视你    like, wherever you are standing in the room.
然后就锁定了    And they lock in.
但我们还是有个限度的对吧    No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them?
可以向他们身上扔东西    We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.
我们可以扔吃的吗  香蕉    We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.
随便什么吃的  没错    Any food. Correct.
但举个例子  我就不大会    But, for example, what I wouldn't do is
让他把鸡巴掏出来    maybe like tell him to pull his cock out
然后找几个妹子    and like get some of the girls to, you know,
玩他什么的    fondle him and shit like that.
那也...不能这么干吗    That would be... That's unacceptable?
这招我们先留着    Let's keep that in our back pocket.
这人比较适合往靶子上扔    This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard.
对  对  没错    Correct. Yes, yes, yes.
他们就适合干这个使    The thing is, this is their gift, okay.
天生就适合被拿来当飞镖扔    They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart.
跟飞镖一样头重脚轻    They're top heavy like a lawn dart.
就是为了让你能投准的    So they're built for accuracy.

给他身上绑个滑板    The brother, you put a skateboard on him,
把他绑在滑板上    you strap him to a skateboard,
然后顺着过道往瓶子上扔    you toss him down an alley at some pins.
-这想法不错  -绝对的    - No shit. That's interesting. - Swear to fucking God.
-这个我们也要吧  -没错我们俩都要    - Can we get that guy? - Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.
但这上面说他兄弟同意露阴    But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.
-他倒是不长高  -他同意吗    - Instead of growing up. Yeah. - He will?
但他们挺易怒的    They are very ornery by the way,
所以跟这些小不点得悠着点    so you gotta be very careful with these little guys.
安全第一    Safety first.
安全第一  好吧    Safety is first, all right?

小气枪怎么样    A pellet gun maybe?
不行  小气枪会伤到他的    No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.
我只想弄晕他  晕死就行    I just want him out. Knocked out cold.
要我说我们还是认准法律漏洞    But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay?
要是我们不把他到人看    If we don't consider him a human,
就单纯的行为来讲  我们就没事    we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear.
就像飞天瓦伦达马戏团    Like The Flying Wallendas.

重要的是你们得记住    The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind
他们互相会八卦的    is that these things gossip.
聚在一起就八卦    They get together and they gossip.
-这点好  -我们最不希望看到的    - That's a good point. - And the last thing
就是他们聚到一起然后说    that we need is them getting together and saying,
他们嘲笑我们了    "Oh, they made fun of us."
那会抹黑斯特拉顿的    Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

去他妈的梅林银行  管他呢    Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.
凭什么总让他们    Why should they be taking
赚走我们的钱    all our fucking money all the fucking time?
这样我们就是证券承销商了    This way we become the underwriters.
我们下一步棋    It was our next big move.
就是找公司帮他们做首次公开募股    Finding companies to take public. IPOs.
这有这样  那些华尔街的小崽子们    It was the only way these Wall Street pricks
才能不把我们当做野鸡证券交易所    would ever stop thinking of us as some shitkicker bucket shop.
我们还有阿克利夫国际    We got Arncliffe International.
我们做事比较不寻常    See, we were a little different.
我们谈正事的时候    We liked to get as fucked up as possible
喜欢嗑药并喝得酩酊大醉    during our business powwows

镇定安眠酮    The Quaalude,
一般叫作安眠酮    or lude, as it is commonly referred to,
于1951年由一位印度医生首次合成    was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor,
是点红点的印度人  不是印第安人     that's dots, not feathers,
当时被当做镇定催眠药开给    as a sedative, and was prescribed to
压力大的家庭妇女缓解睡眠障碍的    stressed-out housewives with sleep disorders.
但很快就有人发现    But pretty soon someone figured out
服药后只要忍住15分钟不睡    that if you resisted the urge to sleep for just 15 minutes,
就能爽翻天了    you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.
当然没过多久大家就开始滥用安眠酮了    Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, of course.
1982年美国和全世界都把安眠酮    And in 1982, the U.S. Government Schedule 1'd them.
列为了一级管控药物    Along with the rest of the world.
所以说安眠酮数量有限越吃越少    Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.
认真的  买都买不到    No shit, you can't even buy 'em anymore.
你们都惨了    You people are all shit out of luck.

-给他们看看鞋子  -好    - Show them the shoes. - Okay. Yeah.
这鞋子很酷的    Anyway, you know, this shoe is pretty cool.
叫玛丽璐    This is the Mary Lou,
我的成名作    which is really the shoe that put me on the map.
如果没有它  我就不会站在这    Without it, I wouldn't be here.
这是给胖妞穿的    It's a fat girls' shoe!
不管你信不信    Believe it or not... Believe it or not though,
玛丽璐实际上和玛丽珍同款    the Mary Lou is actually the
{\an8}{\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}玛丽珍  背带式平底女鞋
只不过是黑色皮质的    same as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.
反击  是谁扔的  是谁扔的    Fight back! Come on! Where you at? Where you at?
好了    All right!
掌声送给史蒂夫·麦登和他超赞的玛丽璐    Let's give it up for Steve Madden and his awesome Mary Lou!
举起来  举起来  自豪地举起来    Hold that up. Hold that up. Hold that up proud!
掌声献上    Give him a round of applause!
发泄完了吗    You guys got that out of your systems, huh?
下午过得怎么样    You having a good afternoon or what?
我要花点时间  告诉你们    I wanna take a moment and tell you why Steve here is so
为什么说史蒂夫与众不同    absolutely off the fucking wall.
因为他是个创作天才    It's because this man is a creative genius.
史蒂夫的能力和天赋    This ability, this gift that Steve has,
不是紧跟女鞋时尚潮流    it goes beyond just spotting the hottest shoe trends.
而是他  能引领潮流    Steve's power is that he creates trends.
懂吗    You understand?
史蒂夫这样的艺术家十年难遇    Artists like Steve come along once every decade.
就像乔治· 阿玛尼  詹尼·范思哲    I'm talking Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace,
可可·香奈儿    Coco Chanel,
伊夫圣罗兰    Yves Saint Laurent.
史蒂夫  过来一下    Steve, come over here for a second.
你们可能没有意识到    I don't think you all realize
史蒂夫·麦登    that Steve Madden
是女鞋界最炙手可热的人物    is the hottest person in the women's shoe industry,
北美的每一家百货商场    with orders going through the roof
他的订单都多到满天飞    at every department store in North America right now.
我们竟有幸邀请他来办公室    We have him here in our office!
谢天谢地  他来了    We should thank our fucking lucky stars this man is here!
我们应该五体投地    We should be on our hands and knees right now,
给他跪舔    getting ready to suck this guy off!
像这样  知道吗    Like this! Okay?
我要跪舔你的鸡鸡  史蒂夫    I wanna suck you off, Steve!
大家都想给你跪舔    Everyone's gonna suck you off!
这就是我们进入    This is our golden ticket
巧克力工厂的金奖券    to the fucking chocolate factory right here!
我要的是    And I wanna meet
威利·旺卡那样的魔法人物    Willy fucking Wonka, okay?
要像奥柏伦柏人那样疯狂一次    I wanna be with the fucking Oompa Loompas like this!
好了  下去吧  下去    All right, get off this fucking stage! Get out of here.
大家都听好了    All right, I want all of you to focus for a second.
看到那些小黑盒子了吗    See those little black boxes?
那叫电话    They're called telephones.
告诉你们一个关于电话的小秘密    I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about these telephones.
它们不会自己拨号  知道吗    They're not gonna dial themselves. Okay?
没有你们  它们只是快没用的塑料    Without you, they're just worthless hunks of plastic.
就像上膛的M16    Like a loaded M16
却没有扣动扳机的士兵    without a trained Marine to pull the trigger.
而这些电话存在的意义    And in the case of the telephone,
就取决于在座的各位    it's up to each and every one of you,
我训练有素的斯特拉顿人    my highly-trained Strattonites.
我的杀手们    My killers!
杀手们  不能接受否定的答案    My killers, who will not take no for an answer!
我的战士们    My fucking warriors,
决不轻易挂断电话    who will not hang up the phone
直到客户被拿下    until their client either buys
或者他妈死球    or fucking dies!
让我来告诉你们一件事    Let me tell you something.
没钱是装不了贵公子的    There is no nobility in poverty.
我可能成为一个富人    I have been a rich man
也可能成为一个穷人    and I have been a poor man.
我每次都他妈选择当富人    And I choose rich every fucking time.
因为作为一个富人    Because at least as a rich man,
当我要面对什么问题时    when I have to face my problems,
我起码可以坐在加长豪车后座出场    I show up in the back of a limo,
穿着一身两千美元的西服    wearing a $2,000 suit
带着四万美元他妈一块的金表    and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!
打一架  揍他    Duke it out! Hit him!
从我身上他妈滚下来    Get the fuck off me!
假如这儿有任何人觉得我肤浅或者物质    And if anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic,
那你去他妈的麦当劳找份工作吧    go get a job at fucking McDonald's,
因为那里才是你他妈该去的地方    'cause that's where you fucking belong!
但在你离开这间满是胜者的房间之前    But before you depart this room full of winners,
我希望你能好好看看你身边的人  看吧    I want you to take a good look at the person next to you. Go on.
因为在不远的将来    Because sometime in the not-so-distant future,
你会开着一辆破破烂烂的福特斑马    you're gonna be pulling up to
在红灯前停下    a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,
而那个人会开着一辆崭新的保时捷    and that person's gonna be pulling up right alongside you
停在你旁边    in their brand new Porsche
身旁还坐着他们漂亮的    with their beautiful wife by their side,
有一对大奶子的妻子    who's got big voluptuous tits.
而你身边会坐着谁呢    And who're you gonna be sitting next to?
某头恶心的角马  满嘴唇毛    Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble,
穿着件无袖长袍    in a sleeveless muumuu,
挤进你身边    crammed in next to you
带着一满车从他妈折扣批发超市买的杂物    in a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club!
那就是将来坐在你身边的人    That's who you're gonna be sitting next to!
所以你们听我说  而且听仔细了    So you listen to me and you listen well.
你是不是还有信用卡账单没付清    Are you behind on your credit card bills?
很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧    Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!
你的房东是不是准备赶你出门了    Is your landlord ready to evict you?
很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧    Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!
你女朋友是否觉得你他妈就是个屌丝    Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking worthless loser?
很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧    Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!
我希望你们能赚够钱去解决这些问题    I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!
你们今天唯一需要做的就是拿起那台电话    All you have to do today is pick up that phone
然后说出我教你们说的话    and speak the words that I have taught you.
然后我就能让你们变得    And I will make you richer
比美利坚他妈合众国    than the most powerful
大部分有权有势的CEO都富有    CEO in the United States of fucking America!
好    Yeah!
他妈的棒极了    Fuck, yeah!
我希望你们上场    I want you to go out there
然后把史蒂夫·麦登的股票    and I want you to ram
塞进你客户的喉咙    Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats
直到他们噎住为止    until they fucking choke on it!
直到他们噎死而且买了十万股为止    Till they choke on it and they buy 100,000 shares!
那就是我想要的    That's what I want.
好  太他妈好了    Yeah! Fuck, yeah.
你们要够凶残    You be ferocious!
-你们要够无情  -好    - You be relentless! - Yeah!
你们要当他妈的电话恐怖分子    You be telephone fucking terrorists!
现在  让我们把这操蛋的东西踢出去吧    Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!
下午一点    At 1:00 p.m.,
我们以每股四块五美元的价格开市    we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.
到一点零三分  股价就超过了十八美元    By 1:03, it was over $18.
就连华尔街上的大投行也在买    Even the big Wall Street firms were buying.
出售的两百万股里面    Of the two million shares offered for sale,
有一百万是从我的老鼠仓帐户流出来的    a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes.
一旦价格到了高位    Now once the price hit the high teens...
你知道的  谁他妈在乎别的    You know what? Who gives a shit?
重点向来都是这个    As always, the point is this.
三小时就他妈两千两百万了    $22 million in three fucking hours!
你能相信吗    Can you believe this shit?
我他妈爱死这个了  宝贝儿    I fucking love this, baby!
这简直太棒了    It's amazing!
乔丹    Jordan!
巴瑞·克莱门打电话找你    Barry Kleinman's on the phone
-未来影视的  -谁    - from Future Video. - Who?
我不知道  他给你婚礼摄过像    I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

他妈的联邦调查局    The fucking FBI?

他叫德纳姆    His name is Denham.
他是调查局纽约办事处的一个探员    He's an agent with the New York office.
他想干什么    What's his problem?
他就像个童子军    Gordon GekkoHe's a Boy Scout.
他觉得你他妈是戈登·盖柯    He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.
{\an8}{\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}戈登·盖柯  华尔街金融大鳄  后因内幕交易入狱
他想要我的婚礼录像做什么    What does he want with my wedding video?
这是对我隐私的一种侵犯    It's like an invasion of my privacy.
你懂我在说什么吗  这就像...    You know what I'm saying? It's like...
这很具有侵略性  你懂    It's intrusive, you know.
他有你整个核心集团的照片    He's got pictures of your whole inner fucking circle.
照片  以及那些人的名字    Pictures, names of the people.
你知道他想干什么吗    You know what he's trying to do?
就是他正在干的事  看看你自己    Exactly what he's doing. Look at yourself.
他试图把你唠叨死    He's trying to rattle you,
他试图把你老婆唠叨死    he's trying to rattle your old lady,
然后她就会朝你叨叨个不停    so she nags you
直到你他妈出庭作证为止    until you become a fucking witness.
他想我自我检举揭发    He wants me to rat on myself?
他想我透露我自己的信息    He wants me to give information about my...
听着  他妈的好消息是    Listen. The good fucking news is,
你知道我认识市里的每个人    you know I know everybody downtown,
我可以打电话给司法部  给缉毒局    I call up the Justice Department, the DEA,
甚至不会有人知道你他妈的存在    nobody even knows you fucking exist,
所以说放松点    so calm down!
他们不知道我的存在    They don't know I exist?
-不知道  -那很好    - No. - That's good.
但你...    But you...
你知道他是谁  是吧    You know who he is, right?
-没错  -所以假如我想要问点消息    - Yeah. - So, if I just wanted to get some more information,
就看看他知道了多少东西    just find out what he knows,
你能去他家吧  是吗    you could go to his house, right?
窃听一下他的电话  安点窃听器    Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.
你能搞到点消息...    You could get some information...
你不能这样搞这些人    You don't fuck with these guys like that.
你不能这样搞他们    You don't fuck with them like that.
你怎么回事  是疯了还是怎样    What are you, nuts or something?
这就是你他妈要干的事情    This is what you fucking do.
不然我付钱给你是干什么的    What do I pay you for?
我是有他妈的侦探执照的  知道吗    I have a fucking P.I. License, you know?
我是靠这个吃饭的    I make a living at this.
我不再是一名警察了    I'm not a cop anymore.
他们会他妈的把我的执照夺走  明白吗    They'll take my fucking license away from me, all right?
好吧    Okay.
好吧  要是这样不行  能不能...    Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...
我能给这家伙打个电话吗    Can I give the guy a call?
-怎么了  这是  -乔丹  乔丹    - Why? Is that... - Jordan. Jordan.
行行好    Do me a favor?
唯一一个能给这家伙打电话的    The only one who calls this guy
就是你他妈的律师    is your fucking lawyer.
我不能打给他  是吧    I can't call him, right?
-这违反了规定吗  -我告诉你    - It's against the rules? - I told you,
不管你他妈对他说了什么    whatever the fuck you say to him,
他都会用来对付你  你难道不明白吗    he's gonna use against you. Don't you understand?
他很聪明  你很蠢    He's smart, you're dumb.
放他妈的屁    Fucking bullshit.
我们今晚是他妈的要好好谈谈    Are we fucking talking tonight,
还是你打算嗑到晕    or are you gonna get schwacked?
上次你嗑这些该死的药时    The last time you took these fucking pills,
你把你的头伸进了他妈的通心粉里    you put your head in the fucking macaroni.
得我去把你抬起来    I had to pick it up.
好吧    All right.
好吧  我不会打给他的    Okay, I won't call him.
伙计们  上船来  踏板就在那边    Hey, fellas! Come on board. The plank's right around there.
欢迎    Welcome!
真是美好的一天啊    What a nice day.
你好    Hey.
欢迎登船    Welcome aboard.
我是乔丹  欢迎登上内奥米号    Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi.
很高兴见到你    Pleasure to meet you.
德纳姆探员  这位是休斯探员    Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.
你好啊    Hi, how are you?
让我来给你们介绍一下  这位是尼克尔    Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
这位是海蒂  来吧  别害羞    Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.
你俩害羞个什么劲啊  别怕    What are you guys all shy for? Don't be scared.
她们是斯特拉顿的朋友    These are friends of Stratton.
-很高兴见到你们  -你好    - It's a pleasure. - Hello.
你信息上说你想单独谈谈    Your message said that you wanted to speak privately.
没错  我是想单独谈谈    Right. I do want to speak privately.
给我们点时间呗  女士们    Give us a minute, huh, ladies?
要我帮你们拿什么东西尽管开口    Let me know if I can get you anything.
我们很乐意帮忙的    We'd be happy to help.
你们饿不饿    You guys hungry?
想吃点什么吗    Want something to eat?
这儿有意面  对虾  龙虾    Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.
我还有威士忌    I got whiskey.
你们想喝什么酒我这儿都有    Any kind of booze you want.
局里不允许我们"出海"的时候喝酒    You know what? The Bureau doesn't allow us to drink while we're at sea.
哈  当然啦    Duh! Of course.
你以前来过这种地方吗    Ever been on one of these before?
你指船上吗    A boat?
我六岁就学会开船了    I learned how to sail when I was six.
你没开玩笑吧  是吗  真的吗    No shit. Is that right? Really?
我的意思是像这样的    I mean on one like this, though?
我的意思是我把前面整个加长    I mean I had the whole front extended
专门用来停直升机    in order to fit the chopper up there.
看见那个了吗    See that?
不管怎样  这是给你的    Anyway, this is for you.
这是参加我婚礼的人的完整名单    It's a complete list of every person that was at my wedding.
我理解你想要整个婚礼录像    I understand you wanted the whole wedding video.
我猜这个能帮你加快进程  对吧    Figured this would help expedite the whole process, right?
-确实如此  -听着  我的重点是    - There you go. - Look, my point is that
我知道你在调查斯特拉顿    I know you're investigating Stratton.
但我想我一辈子也想不通是为什么    But for the life of me, I can't figure out why.
我知道我们是有点不正统    I know we're a little unorthodox,
我们做事有点大张旗鼓    we're a little loud in the way we do things.
但是你得理解    But you gotta understand,
我们是新入行的  你懂    we're the new guys on the block, you know,
我们在努力让自己名扬万里    we're trying to make a name for ourselves.
但我希望你明白  我们不做违法的事    But I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal.
无论如何也不做    Whatsoever.
你可以去找证监会的人    I mean, you could talk to the SEC.
他们过去六个月来我办公室拜访了十五次    They were at my office 15 times over the last six months.
我是说  我没...我没什么要隐瞒的    I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.
你知道证监会只是个民事管理机构    Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency.
而我们查的是犯罪活动    We pursue criminal activities.
正是这样  你要查的是真正的犯罪    Exactly! You go after real criminals,
这让我很好奇你们为什么会调查我    which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for?
我是说  说实话...    I mean, honestly...
你觉得我们做过什么或者在做什么吗    what is it that you think that we did or do?
我不明白    I don't get it.
我...    Well, I...
乔丹  我不能讨论正在进行的调查    Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.
没事  我明白  没事的  我理解    No, I get that. No, I understand.
虽然这么说    With that said...
其实这案子是被扔在我桌上的    this case got dumped on my desk...
-是这样吗  -你懂的  高层    - Did it? - You know, by a higher-up
那些想要作秀的人    who needs to make a show
得借着追查一家新公司为由    of looking into the new company on the block,
-拉上一堆媒体之类的  -新上位那些    - with all the press and everything. - New loud guys.
然后我就变成了来做调查的蠢货    And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking.
就是这样    Exactly.
只是  你懂的...这东西很烦    It's just, you know... it bothers me.
我们是新人    We're the new guy.
我们是去敲华尔街的门的人    We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door.
我的意思是  你应该...    I mean, you should...
你应该去查查那些大投行在干什么    You should see what's going on at the bigger firms.
我说  我知道所有的内幕    I mean, I know all the information.
是真的  高盛  雷曼兄弟  美林    It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill...
{\an8}{\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}均为美国大投行
担保债务凭证    Collateralized debt obligations?
还有什么互联网概念股    This Internet stock bullshit?
简直就是他妈的放屁    I mean, it's a fucking travesty.
我能手把手地告诉你    I could take you step-by-step
他们每一步都在做什么    through what exactly is occurring.
你只需要开口问    All you have to do is ask.
我随时恭候    I'm available.
我就等你这句话了    That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
我不明白像这样的谈话    I don't see why a little sitdown like this
怎么就不能对我们双方都有利了    can't be profitable for the both of us.
本来就应该这样  是吧    It should. Right?
这本来就该对我们双方都有利    It should profit the both of us.
-是应该这样  -听着    - It should. - Look.
我会给你我的私人号码    I'm gonna give you my personal line.
工作日里随时可以打电话给我    Five days a week, you just call me, feel free.
-我会的  -棒极了    - I'll do that. - Great.
你们确定不喝点什么    Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?
你们不饿吗  什么也不要    You're not hungry? Nothing?
-什么都不要吗  不要吗  -不用了    - Nothing? No? - Oh, no.
让我问你几个问题    Let me ask you,
假如你不想透露太多个人信息    and if you don't wanna get too personal,
你可以随时叫我闭嘴    just tell me to shut up at any time.
你是不是曾经考虑过弄个经纪人执照    Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?
我不知道自己有没有听错    Did I hear that right?
你是不是也曾想来华尔街分一杯羹    Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?
-没有吗  -你和谁谈过话    - No? - Who you been talking to?
你他妈和谁谈过了    Who the fuck you been talking to?
你在调查我  我也听了你的事迹    Well, you're investigating me. I hear things.
你懂我意思吧    You know what I mean?
你有没有想过假如你坚持下去了    You ever think about what would've happened
会发生什么    if you would have stayed the course?
你知道吗  每当我搭地铁回家    You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway
蛋蛋都他妈汗湿了    and my balls are fucking sweating,
一套西服连续穿了三天...    I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row...
没错  我当然想过    Yeah, you bet I do.
我以前就想过这个  谁不想呢  是吧    I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right?
没错  谁他妈会不想呢    Right, who fucking wouldn't?
你是怎么...    What do you get...
又是一个私人为题  你不用回答    Another personal question, no need to answer...
没事  没关系的  乔丹    No, that's all right, Jordan.
你能赚多少啊  五六万之类的    What do you pull in? 50, 60K? Something like that?
一年吗  大约    A year? In the ballpark?
我...    Well, I...
这样说吧    Let's put it this way.
局里至少能给你一把免费的枪    You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau.
这他妈让我很生气啊  你懂我意思吗    No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean?
你想想  那些建设了这个国家的人    You think about the people that built this country,
像你一样勤勤恳恳的人    hardworking people like you.
消防员  老师  联邦探员    Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.
结果到最后    End of the day,
你们这群人在经济上被生吞活剥了    you guys get fucking skinned alive financially.
这他妈让我太生气了    It fucking makes me angry.
如今  关于华尔街和这个市场    Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is,
在我看来  我觉得    for me, I feel
能回馈社会是好事  你知道  有些    it's good to give back. You know, there's...
有些情况下我能    There are situations where I can
让这些人处境好点  明白吗    make those situations better for people. You know?
你懂我意思的    You know what I mean.
机遇    Opportunity
就是一切    is everything.
太对了    Exactly.
举个例子  有这么个小孩  是吧    Take for example, I got this one kid, right?
去学校学环境科学之类的    Went to school for environmental science, something like that.
但却被学生贷款困住了    He was bogged down by student loans.
然后他妈又要做三重心脏搭桥手术    Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery.
-天呐  -没错  很惨    - Jesus. - Right. Horrible situation.
是啊    Sure.
但是我们在正确的时候    But we got him into the market
拉他入市  再选一只正确的股票    at the right time and chose the right stock.
我们给予他正确的指导    We gave him the right guidance.
轰  一夜之间  就改变了他整个人生    Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life.
他妈被送进了纽约最好的医院    Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City.
但还是没用    It didn't work out for her,
假设  她还是去世了  很不幸    granted, she passed away, unfortunately.
但我们至少给了他那个机会    But we gave him that opportunity.
你懂我在说什么吗    You know what I'm saying?
这取决于建立一个好团队    It's just about setting up the right team,
然后一夜之间你的人生将得以改变    and then overnight your life can change.
一个实习生能...能...    What does... What does an intern...
一个实习生做这样一单能赚多少    What does an intern make in a deal like that?
在那种情况下    Well, in that situation,
在那笔特定的交易里  就那一笔    in that particular trade, and it was one trade,
五十多万美元吧    north of half a million dollars.
而且我会为任何人做这件事  明白吗    And I'd do that for anybody, you know,
任何需要适当的指导的人    anybody that needs the proper guidance.
能再说一遍吗  就把刚刚说的再说一遍    Can you say that again, just the way you said it?
一模一样的    Just the same way.
我不懂你在说什么    I don't know what you're talking about.
算了吧  你当然懂我在说什么    Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about.
我觉得刚刚乔丹在干的事是...    I think what Jordan just did is he...
-假如我没弄错的话...  -不是    - If I'm not mistaken... - No.
你刚刚在试图贿赂一个联邦官员    ...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.
没有  理论上我没有贿赂任何人    No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.
不不  我听到的可不是这样的  乔丹    No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan.
不不  根据美国刑法    No, no, according to the U.S. criminal code,
贿赂必须有个    there needs to be an exact
确切的金额    dollar figure for the exchange of services.
那个在法庭上站不住脚的    That would not hold up in a court of law.
不不  我听见的可不是这么回事    Nah, it's not how I heard it.
不不不  事实就是如此    No, no, no, that's the truth.
但我想告诉你这个    But I want to tell you this.
你说    Yeah.
那个告诉我你曾经试过    The same gentleman that told me
考经纪人执照的人    that you tried to get your broker's license
也和我说过你是个规矩正直的人    also told me that you are a straight arrow.
他把我仔细调查了一番    He ran a security check on me.
这个嘛...    Well...
没错  假如你驾着一艘    Yeah, when you sail on a boat
像是邦德电影里反派开的船    fit for a Bond villain,
那有时你就得扮扮"恶人"   是吧    sometimes you need to play the part. Right?
我觉得你俩是时候滚下我的船了    I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat.
你说什么    What do you say?
你知道吗  乔丹  我告诉你一件事    You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something.
大部分我逮捕的华尔街混蛋    Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust,
他们都是天生如此    they're to the manor born.
-是吗  -没错    - Is that right? - Yeah.
他们老爹是混蛋    Their fathers are douchebags,
老爹的老爹也是    just like their fathers before them.
但你不一样    But you...
乔丹  你全是自己打拼出来的    You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own.
是吗    Did I?
-佩服佩服  小伙子  -小伙子    - Good for you, little man. - Little man?
真心佩服    Good for you.
你居然叫我小伙子    Me, the little man?
而且我跟你说    And let me tell you something.
我跟你说点别的    Let me tell you something else.
老实说  我没跟你开玩笑啊    Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,
这艘船可说是我登上过的    this is one of the nicest boats
-最好的船了  真心话  -我看也是    - that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you. - I bet it is.
你知道我还怎么想的吗    And you know what I was just thinking, too?
如果哪天局里派人封了这艘船    The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office
那我他妈肯定就是大英雄    when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat.
你他妈说是不是这样  乔丹    Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,
瞧瞧这艘船    look at this thing!
多漂亮    It's beautiful!
而且你船上还有美妞儿  多好    And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful.
挺好  快他妈给我滚    All right, get the fuck off my boat.
我想我们很快就会    I'm sure we'll be seeing each other
-再见面的  -我同意    - real soon. - I'm sure.
祝你们坐破地铁    Good luck on that subway
回家干你们臭婆娘的路上一路顺风    ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.
我则要让海蒂    I'm gonna have Heidi lick
就着鱼子酱舔我的蛋    some caviar off my balls in the meantime.
你两个想不想带些龙虾回家    Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home?
一群混蛋  谅你们也吃不起    Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them!
一群贱货    Fucking cheap fucks.
混蛋    Fucking miserable pricks.
两位  看看我掏兜的时候找着了啥    Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look!
把你们一年的工资都掏出来了    A year's salary right here.
你知道我管这叫什么吗  优惠券    You know what I call them? Fun coupons!
看见了吗    See that!
我都嫌多的优惠券    They're fun coupons!
瑞士  瑞士有什么好逛的    Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?
当然是去逛瑞士银行    Swiss fucking banks, that's what.
现在得遮遮丑  我必须得把钱藏起来    It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money.
因特·鲁格拉特    Enter Rugrat.
他是在法学院里认识这个瑞士银行家的    He knew this Swiss banker from law school.
这是干欧洲娘们用的    That's for European pussy!
但他人在日内瓦    But he was in Geneva.
所以这趟长途飞机  我肯定要嗨着过去    And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober.
我知道我只需适当的药量    So I knew if I took my drugs right,
就能睡完整个旅程    I could sleep through the entire flight.
但必须要按时按量    But I had to take them just right.
下午四点整  我又吃了几片    At 4:00 P.M., I popped a few more ludes,
这样等我开完销售会议    which started kicking in by the time
药劲正好上来    I finished my sales meeting.
这是手脚刺痒阶段    My tingle phase.
到晚餐时  我再吃几片    By dinner, I popped a few more
就着几杯鸡尾酒和一两片安定    on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two.
这是口齿不清阶段    My slur phase.
到八点半  我再多吃几片    By 8:30, I took a few more ludes
这时我差不多就走不动道了    and pretty much lost all my motor skills.
这是口水横流阶段    This was the drool phase.
到十点  我就完全不知道我是谁了    By 10:00, I didn't know who or what the fuck I was.
这是记忆丧失阶段    The amnesia phase.
我们在午夜之前登机    We boarded the plane just before midnight.
妈呀  瞧瞧    Wow! Look at you!
-好个美人儿  -请别这样  先生    - You're beautiful. - Excuse me, sir.
他安眠药的药劲上来了  他没事的    His sleeping pills just kicked in. He's all right.
能出示一下登机牌吗  先生    May I see your boarding passes, sir?
我们当然有登机牌    We have the boarding passes.
向老天发誓  我真想干她    Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.
干嘛呢  轻点    Hey! Fucking relax.
老天  快把你的爪子从我的老二上拿开    Oh, my God! You got your hand on my fucking cock!
别闹了    Cut it out.
你看他还到处乱摸    He's got his hand on my dick again.
我这是给你系安全带    I'm just trying to buckle you up.
你摸着他老二了吗    You got your hand on his dick?
大庭广众的可控制着点啊    You gotta stop doing that in public places.
我的天  放手    Oh, my God. Take it off!
快放手    Take it off!
我听说你头发里有藏宝图呢    I heard there's a treasure map under here.
住手    Stop!
-抱歉  先生  -我知道  女士    - Excuse me, sir. - I know, miss.
请您坐下    Please sit down.
-管好他  -请做回您的座位去    - Watch it. - Go back to your seat, please.

先生  请您坐回去    Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.
坐回去    Please sit down!
-我这就去  别说了  -抱歉    - I'm going! Stop. - Okay, sorry.
我们抱歉  我们这就睡觉去    We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.
提问  我要求提问    Question. I wanna ask you a question.
系好您的安全带  先生    Fasten your seat belt, sir.
您不系好安全带我们就    We cannot take off if you haven't fastened
-没法起飞  -我真想爽一发啊    - your seat belt. - I'm really horny, too.
坐好  系上安全带    Sit down. Fasten it.
-那好  我这就坐  -我来给您系    - Right. Okay, I'll sit down... - I will do it for you.
-说啥  -我帮您系    - What? - I'll do it for you.
说人话啊  姑娘    You gotta speak English.
您这异域风情的口音我们听不懂    We don't understand this language you're speaking.
我要帮他系上安全带    I will help him with his seat belt.
-你得让他坐正  -坐好  坐好先生    - You gotta put it on right. - Sit back. Sit back, sir.
-这就对了  -我只要倚着就行啦    - There you go. - All right. I'll just lean back...
快来帮忙    Bitte, Hilfe!

可恶    Jesus Christ!
该死    Fuck!
唐尼    Donnie...
唐尼  这不好玩  快给我解开    Donnie, this isn't funny. You gotta untie me, buddy.
不行啊    I can't untie you.
机长绑的你  再不然他就要用电棍了    The captain tied you up. He almost fucking tasered you.
为什么    Why?
不怪你  亲爱的  别怪你自己    it's not you, sweetheart, don't beat yourself up.
别紧张  他没事  他只是怕坐飞机    Easy, easy. He's fine. He's just a nervous flyer.
你冲别人大喊大叫    You were screaming at people.
不是吧    Oh, fuck off.
你在地板上满地打滚    You were on the floor rolling around and shit.
我的天    Oh, Jesus.
你管机长叫什么奴    You called the captain the N-word.
我这么叫他了吗    I called the captain the N-word?
-他非常不高兴  -是吗    - Yeah, he was very upset. - Really?
-还好我们在头等舱  -我的天    - Luckily we're in first class. - Jesus.
我说你是不是嗑药上瘾了    Jesus Christ, I think you have a fucking drug problem.
药在哪  到底在哪    Where are the ludes? Where are the ludes?
我藏得好好的  别紧张    They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.
-都弄好了  -那就好    - I got it. - Okay.
那就好    Thank God.
我的天  等我们    Jesus Christ, what are we
到了瑞士可怎么办啊  哥们    gonna do when we get to Switzerland, buddy?
大事不妙了    This is bad.
这破玩意儿绑这么紧  我喘不过气来了    Fucking things are against my chest. I can't breathe.
帮帮忙  抚慰抚慰我  求你了    Come on, do something to calm me down. Please.
好好  你先闭嘴  先闭嘴    Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
好吧    Okay.

使点劲  哥们    Rub it harder, buddy.
你是好宝贝    You're all right.
我们都爱你  闭上嘴    We all love you. Shut the fuck up!
贝尔福先生  你可以走了    Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.
真的吗    Really?
-跟你说  唐尼  -咋了    - Hey, Donnie. - Yeah?
等我们到了那边  你注意点你自己    When we get out there, try not to act like yourself.
到了日内瓦就别混犯浑了  可以吗    Okay? Let's make Geneva an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?
你冲着我来干什么    What are you fucking coming at me for?
听着  你现在坐在加长豪车而不是    Hey, listen. The only reason you're sitting in this limo
瑞士监狱里必须感谢我朋友  懂吗    and not in a Swiss jail is because of my friend. Okay?
帮个忙    Hilfe!
-到了到了  -大家伙稳着点    - We're here. We're here. - Everyone calm down.
乔丹·贝尔福    Jordan Belfort!
您终于来了    At last.
我从尼古拉斯那听到了您的许多壮举    Nicholas has told me so much about you.
乔丹  这位是简·雅克·索雷尔    Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.
-很高兴认识您  -幸会幸会    - Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Nice to meet you.
您说笑了    It's a joke.
你只要坐一坐就知道是什么感觉了    You'll understand when you're in the fucking seat.
你需要大点的沙发  待客用的    You need a bigger couch. For guests.
哈哈  哈哈  我还是没懂  抱歉    Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry.
我对你们国家的银行保密法很感兴趣    I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws here.
等下  那个  抱歉乔丹    Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.
瑞士人待客总是得先来十分钟    Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...
这个那个的    Blah, blah, blah.
-闲聊  -对就是闲聊  多谢    - Chit chat. - Yeah, chit chat, thank you.
然后再谈正事    ...before business can be discussed.
是吧    Yeah.
那好    Of course.
那咱们就说正事  您想了解些什么    Let's get down to it. What would you like to know?
在什么情况下  你们有义务    Under what circumstances would you be obligated
和联邦调查局    to cooperate with an FBI
或者美国司法部之类的部门合作    or a U.S. Justice Department investigation, for example?
看情况    Ca depend.
还得看情况    Ca depend?
没错    Oui.
具体看什么情况    Ca depend on what, exactly?
看美国人接下来几个月会不会    Whether America plans to invade Switzerland
占领瑞士    in the coming months.
要不要我去看看十字架上有没有跑坦克    Shall I check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?
-那是十字街  -对对  十字街    - Yes. Rue de la Croix. - Croix. Croix.
是街不是架  还"十字架"  是街啦    Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.
我们在法学院常玩这个来着  不信你看    See, this is what he used to do back in law school. Check me.
-是香槟还是香崩  -没错    - Champagne. Champagne. - Yeah.
没错  还有炸薯条和炸洋芋    Yeah, yeah. French fries, pommes frites.
-总之这类的  -逗出鸟来了    - And that kind of stuff. - That's funny.
我问的是  你这瑞士废柴    What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
你会不会事后坑我    is are you going to fuck me over?
我当然听明白了  你个美国白痴    I understand perfectly, you American shit.
外国司法部门能够获得    The only way the Banque Real de Geneve
日内瓦银行合作的唯一情况    would cooperate with a foreign legal body
就是他们指控的罪名在瑞士也同样违法    is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.
但只有很少的瑞士法律涉及您从事的业务    But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices.
从金融角度讲    From a financial standpoint,
您现在身处天堂了    you are now in heaven.
我就说他很厉害吧    See, I told you he was fantastic, right?
如果美国司法部    If the U.S. Justice
发传票给我们  我们会只当它    Department sent us a subpoena, it would become
是厕纸    papier toilette.
擦屁股用的    We would wipe our ass with it.
当然  除非他们是要调查    Unless, of course, it was an investigation
股票诈骗    into stock fraud,
我没记错的话  这在你们瑞士也是犯罪    which is a crime here in Switzerland, if I'm correct.
这样的话你们将有义务与他们合作    Then there would have to be cooperation on your part,
-如果我没说错的话  -当然    - if I'm not mistaken. - Yes.
当然会合作    Yes, we would.
如果账户是在你名下的话    Assuming the account is under your name.
但如果不是你的名字    If it were another name,
是你的朋友  令亲之类的    a friend's, camarade...
表亲吗    Cousin?
表亲  肯定也行    Cousin, absolute.
-你是说亲戚  -没错    - Relative? - Yeah.
你刚才那是哼小调    Was that yodeling I just heard
还是我所理解的那个意思    or did you just say what I thought you said?
就是那个意思    Yes. Yes.
他这是在建议我建个老鼠仓    He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.
但一只美国老鼠绝对没法    But a U.S. rathole would never get
把那么多钱弄到瑞士来    into Switzerland with all that money.
我还得找个有欧洲护照的老鼠    What I needed was a rathole with a European passport.
乔丹    Jordan.
你好啊  我最亲爱的姨妈    Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?
欢迎  路上没堵车吧    Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?
没有  当然没有    Oh, no, not at all.
乔丹  快进来    Jordan, come in.
还好说服艾玛姨妈没费多少劲    Thank God Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing.
看来英国人跟瑞士人差别也没那么大嘛    Turned out the British weren't too different from the Swiss.
只要钱跟上  一切就迎刃而解了    Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.
英式英语里"老鼠仓"怎么说    How do you say "Rathole" In British?
一旦你碰上任何麻烦    If you get into any trouble whatsoever,
我就会马上站出来  承认是我骗了你    I'll come forth immediately. I'll say that I duped you.
我保证    That I promise.
冒险尤其能让人倍感青春  是吧亲爱的    Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it, darling?
有时我禁不住想    Sometimes I wonder
你是不是让钱给拿住了  亲爱的    if you let money get the best of you, my love.
以致忽视了其他种种    Among other substances.
这么明显啊    It's that obvious, huh?
天气一点都不热  但你却直冒汗    It's chilly, darling, and you're sweating bullets.
我该怎么说呢    What can I say? I'm...
我是个瘾君子    I'm a drug addict.
瘾头非常大    I really am.
白粉  摇头丸    Cocaine, pills,
这个那个  我都嗑    whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.
这是实情    Now that's the truth.
我是说    I mean...
我还有性瘾    I'm a sex addict, too.
这世上肯定还有比性瘾更危险的事    Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.
天啊  我跟你说这些干什么  我干嘛    Jesus, why am I telling you all this? Why am I...
真抱歉    I'm sorry.
因为我是个很好说话的人    Because I'm very easy to talk to.
还真是  你的确很好说话    You are. You are easy to talk to.
在我看来    I suppose it's...
这是我的责任    Just my job, you know.
有这么多人依仗着我    All these people dependent on me.
事关数以千万计的美金  你懂的    Tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know.
但有时我又觉得    Sometimes I feel like I...
我有点贪多嚼不烂了    I've bitten off more than I can chew, you know.
但你的胃口很大    You're a man with large appetites.
是啊    Yeah.
这姐们是在挑逗我吗    Is she fucking hitting on me?
是啊    Yeah.
还真是这样    Yeah, I am.
看来是我自作自受了哈    I suppose I put that on myself though, right?
我自己的决定    My decision.
有时候很难    It's just hard to...
很难控制内心的焦虑  你懂吗    Hard to learn to control the anxiety sometimes, you know?
就是那个    You know, to...
试着放松  放下心事    learn to relax and let go and...
去释放压力吗    to release the tension.
她还真在挑逗我    She is hitting on me.
我的天啊    Holy shit!
没错  释放压力    Yeah, to release the tension.
看来我们都得    I suppose we...
都得试着做到    We all just need to learn...
顺其自然  对吧    learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know?
这哥们他妈是不是在挑逗我    Is he fucking hitting on me?
稳住  亲爱的    Stability, dear.
我们是亲戚    Family.
你照顾好我的侄女  亲爱的    You take care of my niece, my love.
这边放心交给我    I'll take care of everything over here.
成交    Deal.
爽  真他妈爽    Come on! There you go.
我们货真价实地干了千金一炮    We had, literally, a fuckload of money.
艾玛自己可运不了这么多钱    Aunt Emma could never carry all this by herself.
我就琢磨  还有谁有欧洲护照    So I thought to myself, who else has a European passport?
布拉德  你捆得太紧了    Brad, you're making this too fucking tight!
而布拉德作为一个成功的药贩子    Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,
每年冬天都要在法国南部度假    spent his winters in the south of France,
在那里他遇见了他的妻子  仙黛尔    which is where he met his wife, Chantalle,
她本是斯洛文尼亚的脱衣舞女    a stripper of Slovenian origin
正好就出生在    born, in of all places,
瑞士    Switzerland.
这根本就成不了    Well, this is fucked.
成了才怪    No shit.
她怎么着得跑50趟吧    Like, this will take her like 50 trips.
我知道    I know.
不如这么着吧    Let me ask you something?
她不是还有家人吗    What about her family? Right?
他们人人都有瑞士护照    I mean, they all got Swiss passports, right.
她有父母  有兄弟  是不是    She's got parents, she's got a brother, right?
他兄弟还有个老婆  这就是五个人了    The brother's got a wife. That's five fucking people.
顶多六七趟  是吧    Six, seven trips, boom, right?
他们跟她一样都是瑞士的蠢货    They're all fucking Swiss nitwits like her.
-他们会同意的  -没准能行    - They'll do it. - We could do that.
至少我还有家人  你个大鼻子蠢货    At least I have a family, you crooked-nose fuck!
别忘了我的钱    Hey, don't forget about my money.
抱歉你说啥    I'm sorry, what's that?
我忘了提了  他也有    Yeah, I forgot to tell you. He's got some...
-也有些钱要运  -我的钱    - He's got some money. - My money.
我一周之内要进个几百万的    I got a couple of mil coming in like a week.
钱进账 我给你电话  你来取    When it gets in, I'll give you a call, you come pick it up.
你还给我打电话    You give me a call?
等钱来了    When it gets here,
我给你打电话  你来取    I'll give you a call and you'll come pick it up.
我们又不给你干活  老兄    Well, we don't fucking work for you, man!
亲爱的  你奶子上贴的全是我们的钱    Sweetheart, you have my money taped to your tits.
明白吗  说白了  你就是给我干活的    Okay? Technically, you do work for me.
乔丹  我得跟你谈谈    Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.
我他妈不干这个  我跟你明说了吧    If I fucking do this, I'm telling you right now,
我才不会去找他    I ain't going to him, okay.
-我又不是给他跑腿的  -我懂    - I'm not a fucking shvartze. - I got it.
我不干上门取件的事  明白吗    I don't do fucking pickups, all right?
-我明白  -你听好了    - I got it. - Well, listen to me.
我说在哪碰头就在哪    We meet someplace that I fucking say.
然后你告诉那个死胖子    And you tell that fucking piece of shit,
-过时不候  -我会说的    - he comes correct. - I will.
他敢闯一丁点乱子  我发誓    He comes in all fucking loopy and fucked up, I swear to God
我把丫的牙打回牙床子里去    I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.
你他妈要打谁的牙床子    You're gonna mash whose fucking teeth in?
咱俩玩玩看谁打谁的牙床子    Whose fucking teeth are you gonna mash in?
你那破桌子上堆的是我的钱  不是你的    I put the money on that fucking table! Not you!
要不是老子  你他妈能有今天    I'm the reason we have this whole fucking deal!
-他有枪  白痴  -操他妈的枪    - He's got a gun, you fucking idiot! - Fuck his gun!
那堆钱是我的    I put that money in there!
你他妈逼就是个药贩子    You know what? You're a fucking pill dealer.
像你这种人我一捞一大把    I got five more just like you, bro.
继续说啊  你他妈的狗杂种    Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!
你他妈逼穿得也像坨屎    You know what else? You dress like shit!
操死你丫的    So fuck you!
-王八操的  -老天    - Fucking motherfucker! - Oh! Jesus!
爽不爽  你个操屁眼的  看谁是基佬    How about that, faggot? Who's a faggot?
你还好吧  兄弟    You okay? Hey, pal.
第二天  艾玛姑妈飞去了日内瓦    The next day, Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.
带了两百万美元现金    Two million in cash in her carry-on,
对瑞士那边来说可是九牛一毛    which in the big picture was a drop in the Swiss bucket.
因为在接下来的一个月里    'Cause the following month,
往返欧洲六趟    over the course of six round trips,
仙黛尔的亲戚朋友    Chantalle's family and
毫无闪失地将两千万美元现金    friends smuggled in over 20 million in cash
偷运进了瑞士    without even a hiccup.
-这还有呢  -是吗    - And I have some more. - Really?
-给你  -噢  谢谢    - Here. - Oh, thank you.
还有    And here.
-欢迎光临  -欢迎光临    - Welcome. - Welcome?
一共四大包    Yeah, like four bags of it.
斯洛伐克瑞士还是斯洛文尼亚瑞士    Are you Swiss-Slovakian or Swiss-Slovenian?
-斯洛文尼亚  -斯洛文尼亚    - Slovenian. - Slovenian?
管它呢  反正你是金发美女    Who cares. You're blonde.
讨厌啦    Oh, stop.
我操    Shit.
你就不能把车停好吗    Just put the fucking car in park,
你个傻逼    you dumb fucking idiot!
这个箱子怎么合不上    I can't close this briefcase.

你车开的歪七扭八的    You fucking drive in here like a fucking maniac,
引来多少注意你知道吗    you know the attention that that fucking draws?
-我不傻  我很聪明  -聪明    - I'm not stupid. I'm smart. - Smart?
-我一单生意就几百万  -没错    - I make million-dollar deals. - That right.
还是和聪明的重要人物做的  不像你    With smart important people, unlike you.
他们不会因为怕了就动手打人  明白吗    People who don't sucker-punch people when they're scared. Okay?
-你是说我怕了  -顺便还有    - I'm scared, huh? - And by the way,
你还没给我一个道歉呢    I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.
你想要我道歉  是吧    You want an apology, okay.
我每天下班后    I check my fucking messages every day
-都他妈要查下收件箱  -是吗    - when I come home from work. - Did you?
-还有答录机  都是空的  -没有吗    - My answering machine. Zero. - Didn't get one, huh?
我还设置了闪光提醒    I got a blinking light,
因为你屁都没跟我吭一声    because I don't have shit from you.
你这张欠扇的嘴    You know what, you got a big fucking mouth, okay?
我叫我老婆随时候着    I got my wife checking the messages
每45分钟给我办公室打个电话  问我    every 45 minutes calling the office, saying,
"布拉德道歉了吗"    "Has Brad apologized yet?"
"答录机上有留言吗"    "Is there an apology message on the machine?"
我又不是傻的  你知道吗    I don't have jack shit. You know what?
你不能这样对别人    That's not how you treat people.
你这张嘴太欠扇了    You got a big fucking mouth, you know.
我不和你计较了  赶紧把包给我    I'm gonna give you a fucking pass. Just give me the case.
你还不和我计较    You're gonna give me a pass?
少废话了行吗    Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.
我的天  操蛋村的村长    Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville
从操蛋村下山来不和我计较了    came down from Fucksville to give me a pass!
操蛋村是吧    From Fucksville, huh?
那操蛋村的村长今天不在    Hey, what are the citizens of Fucksville doing today
操蛋村村民都干嘛呢    when their Emperor's gone?
在暴乱吗    Is it mayhem?
到处打砸抢烧  强奸妇女吗    Are people looting and raping?
你下山来了那些傻逼都干什么呢    What are all the little fuckheads doing while you're here?
操你妈的  把包给我    Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

我都不知道我今天要干出什么    fucking scene that I've ever caused in my life
惊天动地的大事了    if you come at me again.
-你知道吗  -你他妈小声点    - You know what? - Just fucking keep it down.
我觉得    I got...
我不是故意要躲着你    I don't wanna be out of line or anything,
但我觉得你好像喜欢我    but I think you like, like me. Like you...
就像你刚靠近我时...    Like when you come at me...
你今天怎么了  你他妈...    What's the matter with you? What the fuck is...
...你的眼神  我发誓我真的看到了    ...and you look at me. I swear I just noticed it.
你他妈好像...    You have like a fucking, like...
眨了下眼  你刚才眨了下眼    Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.
你是想亲我吗  老兄    Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

只是你不是我喜欢的那一型    You're just not the one for me, pal.
明白我意思吗  我不是...    You know what I mean? It's not...

别留任何一张在箱子里    Don't leave one dollar inside the briefcase.
当你把钱全拿出箱子    And once you have it all
整齐摆好后    neatly organized outside the briefcase,
你把它拿起来塞进    I need you to take it and I need you to shove it right up
你老婆的拉脱维亚逼里面  明白了吗    your wife's Latvian cunt, you understand?

放下箱子  把手举起来    Drop the case! Put your hands in the air!
跪下    Get down.
跪下  跪下    Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees!
我操你妈    Motherfucker!
乔丹  我有个惊喜给你    Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!
-什么惊喜  -20粒正宗柠檬片    - What's that? - Twenty real Lemmons.
我认识的一个退休药剂师    Retired pharmacist's client of mine,
把它在保险箱放了15年了    they've been in the safe for 15 years.
你他妈逗我呢  柠檬片    Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?
这能把咱们的脑袋都爽翻天    They're gonna knock us on our fucking heads.
柠檬714就是安眠药中的战斗机    When it comes to Quaaludes, the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.
-你敢相信吗  -我的老天    - Can you believe it? - Oh, my God.
我以为这只是一个神话    I thought they were like a myth.
这药比当今市面上的任何一种都要强三倍    Three times as powerful as anything available today.
看看这些宝贝    Look at these babies.
唐尼真是懂得怎么庆祝啊    Boy, Donnie really knew how to celebrate.
他说这个要留在特别时机再用    He said he was saving these for a special occasion.
比如过生日  击掌庆祝时    Like a birthday, or being clap free,
亦或是咱的钱安全抵达瑞士    or our money arriving safely in Switzerland.
于是当晚    So that night,
我撇开所有计划并清除我体内    I cleared my schedule and I rid my body
任何会影响我爽的东西    of anything that could fuck with my high.
这是欢庆时刻    It was celebration time.
来吧    Okay.
先来一颗  看看怎么样    Start off with one, see how it goes?
我的药头说只能吃一颗    My guy says all we'll need is one.
给你    Here you go.
-干杯  -干杯    - Salud! - Cheers.
说不定我再拉一下就会下去了    Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.
史蒂夫  史蒂夫    Steve! Steve!
我要离开这儿    I gotta get out of here!
卡尔  我搞明白了    Carl, I think I got it figured out.
这个肯定是拉一下朝上拉两下朝下    It must be one pull for up and two pulls for down.
好吧    Okay.
有感觉吗    Do you feel anything?
没有    No.
都35分钟了    It's been 35 minutes.
可能我们磕了这么多年有耐药性了    Maybe we've built up a tolerance after all these years, huh?
屁用没有    This is bullshit!
我的新陈代谢飞速运转  啥感觉也没有    My metabolism's pumping. I can't feel shit!
时间太长了    They're old.
是不是过期了    You think they lost their potency, huh?
看下瓶子    Check the bottle!
81年1月    January '81.
早他妈过期了    They're fucking duds.
操    Fuck!
我们再...    Let's take...
我们再来两颗    Let's take two more each.
-乔丹  -怎么了宝贝    - Jordan. - Yeah, baby.
你们俩傻逼干什么呢    What are you two retards doing?
我们在健身  亲爱的    We're working out, honey.
波·迪特尔来电话了    Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.
知道了    Okay.
-知道了  -嗯    - Okay? - Okay.
波  出什么事了    Hey, Bo, what's going on?
乔丹  仔细听我说    Jordan, listen to me clearly.
我电话上不能和你说  我要和你谈谈    I cannot talk to you on this phone, I have to talk to you.
快出来  出什么事了    Get out of here. What's going on?
听我说  快他妈离开你家  乔丹    Listen to me! Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

我也不知道出什么事了    I don't know what the fuck's going on.

离我家最近的公用电话    The closest pay phone I could get to
在布鲁克维尔乡村俱乐部    was at the Brookville Country Club.
这是一家上流社会大本营    It was a real WASP stronghold,
就在离我家一英里远处    just a mile down the road from my house.
波  是我  出什么事了    Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me. What's going on?
我在公用电话了  什么事    I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?
仔细听我说    Listen to me carefully.
你的朋友    Please. Your little friend there,
布拉德  你的小兄弟  进监狱了    Brad, your little buddy, he's in jail.
他为什么进了监狱    What the fuck's he in jail for?
-他干什么了  -我不知道    - What'd he do? - I don't know what he did.
我长岛的朋友告诉我    My friends in Long Island told me
他在一家商场门口被抓了    he got picked up in some fucking shopping mall.
他被关进...    He got locked up by...
等等  你说在商场    Wait, wait. Did you... Did you say a shopping mall?
-对  -他和唐尼在一起    - Yeah. - He was with Donnie.
他本来要去帮忙送钱    He was supposed to deliver some money,
-被那死胖子搞砸了...  -听我说    - then that fucking fat piece of shit... - Listen to me!
我他妈现在就要找他问问    I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!
听我说  千万别去  听我的    Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.
德纳姆  那个FBI探员    That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,
有人告诉我他监听了你的电话    somebody told me he's got your phones tapped.
还有你办公室和你家的    Your office and your home.
再别他妈用这些电话了    Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!
好了  我操  知道了  知道了    Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.
乔丹    Jordan.
你没有要贿赂这个FBI探员吧    You didn't try to bribe this fucking FBI agent, did you?
我没有贿赂他    No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.
我以为你是傻逼啊  没有    You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.
你他妈说的什么鸟语  我听不懂    What the fuck did you say? I can't understand you.
再说一遍    Say that again.
我说...    I said...
你他妈说的什么乱七八糟的    What the fuck are you saying?
我说...    I said...
你磕嗨了吗    Are you fucking high?
乔丹  你他妈磕嗨了吗    Jordan, are you fucking high?
乔丹  行行好  就呆那儿    Jordan, do me a favor, stay where you are.
不要开车了    Don't get behind the wheel of the car.
我叫罗科过去接你    I'm gonna send Rocco over to pick you up.
乔丹  乔丹    Jordan! Jordan!
放了15年    After 15 years in storage,
柠檬片产生了延迟效果    the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse.
90分钟后这些天杀的药丸才生效    It took 90 minutes for these little fuckers to kick in.
可一旦生效    But once they did...
我直接跳过了刺痛状态    I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase
进入了流口水状态    and went straight to the drool phase.
告诉我你在哪  别他妈开...    Tell me where you are! Don't fucking drive...
这些小东西药性太猛了    These little bastards were so strong,
我发掘了一种全新的感受    I discovered a whole new phase.
脑瘫状态    The cerebral palsy phase.
加油  站起来    Come on, stand up!
好吧  走路是没戏了    Okay, walking's out.
想想  再想想  还有什么办法    All right, think, think. What else is there?
有了  我可以爬  像斯凯拉那样爬    Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!
操  小孩爬起来那么容易    Fuck! The kid makes it look so goddamn easy!

想到了  想到了    I got it! I've got it!
我可以滚  我可以滚    I can roll! I can roll!
乔丹    Jordan.
老天  你人呢    Oh, Jesus. Where are you?
我在乡村俱乐部    I'm at a country club!
在哪    What?
我在乡村俱乐部    I'm at a country club!
我他妈听不懂你说的什么    I don't know what the fuck you're saying.
你赶紧回家来    Look, you need to get home.
唐尼已经失控了  他在另外一条线上    Donnie is out of control! He's on the other line
和一瑞士男在打电话  我不认识    with some Swiss guy. I don't know...
什么    What?
别让他打电话    Get him off the phone!
我听不懂你说什么    I can't understand you!
不要    Get him
让他    off
打电话    the phone!
我他妈听不懂你说的什么  乔丹    I don't know what the fuck you're saying, Jordan.
你能回来吗  快点    Can you just get home? Hurry!
我离家还不到一英里    I was less than a mile from home.
我尽量慢慢开    I drove as slow as I fucking could.
连果冻滑得都比我快    I'd seen Jell-O move faster.
我本来要再给你两百万    I was gonna give you two million.
我要吃[迟]一些了    I's gonna be lates.
你吃了两百万    You ate two million?

你恨两百万    You hate two million?
你可不能恨两百万  唐尼    No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.
奇迹般地  我活着回到了家    By some miracle, I made it home alive,
我和车都没有蹭到    not a scratch on me or the car.
乔丹    Jordan?
我了个大操    Jesus fucking Christ!

他妈的你女儿在家呢    Your fucking daughter's in the house!
太他妈好玩了  唐尼    Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

哦操  我不知道该怎么办    Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.
乔丹  我不知道该怎么办    Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!
我帮不了他了  我的天  乔丹    I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.
天呐  他呛住了  乔丹  快来帮忙    Oh, my God, I think he's choking, Jordan. Do something.

你还好吧  他没事了    You all right? He's all right.
贝尔福先生    Mr. Belfort?
滚出去  滚    Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.
先生  我们需要问你几个问题    Sir, we need to ask you some questions.
你他妈开玩笑吧  去你妈    Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.
来吧  站起来    Come on, get up.
滚出我的房子    Get the fuck out of my house.
-走吧  -我整晚都在这儿    - Let's go. - I've been here all night.
整晚都坐在这儿    I been sitting here all night.
你们他妈什么意思    What the fuck are you talking about?
-你们带他去哪儿  -你们带我去哪儿    - Where you taking him? - Where you taking me?
你们带他去哪儿    Where you taking him?
你们又没有搜查证    You ain't got no warrant.
怎么能随便到别人家里来    Just come up in people's house like that!
你今晚开过你的车吗  贝尔福先生    Did you drive your car tonight, Mr. Belfort?
怎么说呢    Well?
看来我并没有安然无恙地到家    Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.
快他妈让开    Get out of the fucking way!
我擦    Fuck!
你今晚开过这辆车吗    Did you drive that car tonight?
-有  -好的    - Yeah. - Yeah, right.
我可是有家室的    I'm a family man!
有家室的  亲爱的    Family man. Honey!
我没把自己撞死    It was a miracle I wasn't killed,
或者撞死别人真是个奇迹    or that I didn't kill anybody else.
警察带我去问了话  但他们没法起诉我    The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me.
他们没法证明我开了车    They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.
与此同时    Meanwhile,
布拉德因为蔑视法庭坐了三个月牢    Brad did three months in jail for contempt,
因为他不肯供出唐尼    because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.
结果就是  我安然无恙    The result, I was scot-free.
但我也受到了前所未有的监视    But I had eyes on me like never before.
你真是走运  乔丹    You're a lucky man, Jordan.
居然能活着  还不用坐牢    You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail.
你知道我不相信运气的  对吧    You know I don't believe in luck, right?
但是是时候了    But it's time.
拜托让我跟证监会谈好条件    Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal
在你运气用光以前    before your luck runs out.
跟爸爸挥挥手    Wave to Daddy.
嗨    Hey.
你好啊  甜心    Hey, sweetie.
都有什么条件  如果我...    What kind of terms would you be talking about if I...
这很难说    I don't know.
你得坦白一些违反证券规则    You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations,
操纵股价  高压销售    stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics.
都是这样的小罪  你懂的    Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.
你得付几百万的罚款    You pay a couple million dollars in fines,
作为交换  证监会永远不会再烦你    in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time.
那斯特拉顿呢    And Stratton?
斯特拉顿会怎么样    What happens to Stratton?
没别的办法...你必须收手  对吧    There's no way... I mean... You got to walk away. Right?
让唐尼管事就行    Let Donnie be in charge.
没错  唐尼    Right. Donnie.
FBI可没那么好对付    Now the FBI is another animal completely.
他们会继续追查你的犯罪行为    They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing.
不过  只要你自愿离职    However, with you stepping down voluntarily,
我猜你的好朋友德纳姆探员    my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham
也就无计可施了    will be standing around with his dick in his hand.
乔丹    Jordan.
你还有什么好考虑的    What do you have to think about?
你打败了他们    You beat them.
你赢了    You won!
你一辈子都不用工作了    God knows you never have to work again.
你还想怎么样  在牢里度过余生吗    What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?
-你想那样吗  -不想    - Is that what you want? - No.
-当然不想  -那不就得了    - Of course not. - Okay.
你已经挣了全世界的财富    Okay! You got all the money in the world.
难道还想把所有人的钱都挣光吗    You need everybody else's money?
-当然不是  爸  -所以啊    - Of course not, Pops. - Well?
-可这是我一手创造的  -这我知道    - You know, I built it. - I know you built it.
你创造了这些  现在你得保住它们    You built it, so now preserve it.
你知道    You know,
五年前  当我和唐尼·亚速一起创立    five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont
斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特的时候  我就知道    with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day
总有一天我要离开这里    would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on.
现在我非常沉重地宣布...    And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that...
那一天终于来了    That that day is finally here.
我想...我想谢谢你们所有人    I wanna... I want to thank you all for your...
谢谢你们多年的忠诚与敬仰    Your years of loyalty and admiration.
但重点是    But the point is this.
在唐尼的领导下    Under Donnie's leadership,
再加上尼基·克斯考夫和罗比·范伯格    along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg
加入领导层    moving into key management positions,
这里只会比原来更好    this place really, is gonna be better than ever!
我保证  好吗    That I promise you. Okay?
为他们鼓掌吧  来吧    Give them a round of applause. Come on.
这里就是埃利斯岛  各位    This is Ellis Island here, people.
我不管你是谁  从哪里来    I don't care who you are, where you're from,
不管你的祖先是坐他妈的五月花号    whether your relatives came over on the fucking Mayflower
还是从海蒂坐轮胎漂过来的    or on an inner tube from Haiti,
这里就是你的希望之地    this right here is the land of opportunity.
斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特就是美利坚    Stratton Oakmont is America!
你们都认识几米·贝尔泽吧    All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?
是的    Yes, we do.
去你的    Fuck you.
别这样  几米    Come on, Kimmie.
你们可能不知道的是    What you probably didn't know is,
几米是这里最早的经纪人之一    Kimmie was one of the first brokers here,
斯特拉顿最初的二十名员工之一    one of Stratton's original 20.
你们大部分人认识的几米    Now most of you met Kimmie,
是现在这个美丽优雅的女性    the beautiful sophisticated woman that she is today.
穿着三千块的阿玛尼套装    A woman that wears $3,000 Armani suits.
开着崭新的奔驰    Who drives a brand-new Mercedes-Benz.
冬天在巴哈马度假    A woman who spends her winters in the Bahamas,
夏天在汉普顿避暑    and summers in the Hamptons!
我遇到的几米可不是这样的    That's not the Kimmie that I met.
我遇到的几米身无分文    The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together.
她是个穷困潦倒的单亲母亲    She was a single mom on the balls of her ass
有个八岁的儿子    with an eight-year-old son.
她已经欠了三个月的房租    Okay? She was three months behind on her rent.
她来我这儿找工作的时候    And when she came to me and asked me for a job,
只想要五千块的预付工资    she asked for a $5,000 advance,
来付她儿子的学费    just so she could pay her son's tuition.
我是怎么做的  几米    And what'd I do, Kimmie?
告诉他们    Go on, tell them.
你给我写了一张    You wrote me a check
两万五千块的支票    for $25,000.
没错    That's right.
谢谢你    Thank you.
你知道我为什么这么做吗    And you know why that is?
因为我相信你    It's because I believed in you.
因为我相信你  几米    It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,
就像我相信今天在场的每一位    just like I believe in each and every one of you here today.

你最屌  你他妈最屌了    You are the shit. You are the fucking shit.
真是讽刺啊    It's a shame, you know.
这么多年来  我一直告诉你们    For years, I've been telling
不要接受别人的拒绝  对吧    you guys never to take no for an answer, right?
继续努力  不要挂下电话    You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone
知道你得到你想要的    until you get what you want.
因为那是你应得的    Because you all deserve it.
而我就要签的那个混蛋协议    You know, this fucking deal that I'm about to sign,
禁止我参与证券行业    barring me from the securities industry,
禁止我进入斯特拉顿    barring me from Stratton,
我的家    my home.
这他妈算什么啊    What the fuck is that, you know?
我来告诉你它是什么  它是...    I'll tell you what it is. It's...
是我接受别人的拒绝    It's me taking no for an answer, you know.
是他们...    It's them...
他们说服了我  而不是反过来    It's them selling me, not the other way around.
是我变成了伪君子    It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
所以...    So...
你猜怎么着    You know what?
我不走了    I'm not leaving.
我他妈不走了    I'm not fucking leaving!
你他妈升不了职啦    You're not getting a fucking promotion!
演出继续    The show goes on!
这是我的家    This is my home!
他们得拆了这地方    They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball
才能把我弄走    to take me out of here!
让他们派国民警卫队来吧    They're gonna need to send in the National Guard
或者他妈的特警队    or fucking SWAT team,
因为我哪儿也不去    'cause I ain't going nowhere!
去他们的    Fuck them!
乔迪  乔迪    Jordy! Jordy!
乔迪  回来    Jordy! Get back here!

丛林大狂欢吗  上帝啊    Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?
帕迪  你走运了  爱尔兰小子    Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.
乔丹·贝尔福撕毁了和证监会的协议    Jordan Belfort just welched on his deal with the SEC.
可以继续追查他了  狩猎愉快    He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.
我们开始了盛大的狂欢    It was our time to party big.
正好布拉德也出狱了    And just as Brad was released from jail, too.
我道歉  赔他入狱期间的损失    I apologized, even offered to pay him for his time in the can.
但他拒绝了  说他不干了    But he said no, that he was out.
他不想再跟我们有瓜葛    He didn't want any part of us.
可惜的是    Sad thing was,
两年后他就死了    two years later he was dead.
死于心脏病  才35岁    Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.
和莫扎特去世的年龄一样    Same age Mozart died.
他们倒也没什么共同点  不过...    Not that they have a hell of a lot in common, but...
算了  我也不知道怎么会想到这些的    Anyway, I don't know why that came to mind.
没过几天  传票就开始满天飞    Within days, subpoenas started flying.
要求出示文件  做口供  应有尽有    Notices to produce documents, depositions, you name it.
唐尼都给弄得缺水了    Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.
美国政府要给我们传票    United States government wants to give me a subpoena?
咱们斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特就这么对付传票    Here's what we do with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

他们审问了所有人    They interrogated everybody.
我血压低  甲状腺的问题    I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.
审问持续了几个月    It went on for months.
简直是在骚扰我们    It was a total fucking harassment.
让他问问题吧    Tell him to proceed with the questions.
但没有一个斯特拉顿人崩溃    But not a single Strattonite cracked.

好了  我们已经    Okay. You know we've talked
跟这里的好几名员工谈过了    to several of the employees at this firm,
没人记得史蒂夫·麦登首次公开募股的事    and nobody can recall anything about this Steve Madden IPO.
我觉得挺奇怪的    I think it's odd.
你记得运输公司吗    Do you recall Cartage Corporation?
你记得吗    You do recall it?
不  我完全不记得    No, I don't recall that at all.

乔丹  听着  我正盯着屏幕呢    Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen
有大量的史蒂夫·麦登股票被抛售    and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold, okay.
不是我们卖的  所以只能是史蒂夫    It's not coming from us, so it's gotta be Steve.
只有他有那么多股份    He's the only person with that many shares.

史蒂夫·操蛋·混球·麦登鞋业的股份    of Steve-cocksucking- motherfucking-Madden Shoes,
但股权都是在他名下的    the shares were in his fucking name.

这个你不需要担心  乔丹    Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.
你姑姑在死之前    Your aunt, before she died,
签了份文件  任命你为继承人    signed a document naming you as her successor.

你梦想过财政独立    Do you dream of becoming financially independent
却每个月都有还不完的债吗    but struggle every month just to pay your bills?
你想要拥有这样一栋房子    Would you like to own a home like this,
却只能勉强付得起房租吗    but can barely afford to pay your rent?
我是乔丹·贝尔福    My name is Jordan Belfort,
创造财富  并没有什么秘密    and there's no secret to wealth creation.
无论你是谁  来自哪里    No matter who you are, no matter where you came from,
都可以在几个月内    you too can become financially independent
实现财政独立    in just a matter of months.
你需要的是一套策略    All you need is a strategy.
在我24岁那年    When I was 24 years old,
我做了个决定  我不仅要生存还要发达    I made a decision not just to survive, but to thrive.
一开始  我没想过这一切会成真    At first I didn't feel like deals like these were possible.
但我们现在有了房子  还挣了三万三    But we have the house and we have a $33,000 profit.
我现在相信了    I certainly believe now.
好好想想    Think about it for a second.
如果你没勇气拨打乔丹·贝尔福热线    If you don't have the guts to attend Jordan Belfort's
参加他们的研讨会    Straight Line Persuasion System Seminar,
又怎么可能创造财富呢    then how do you expect to make any money?
如果你想成为百万富翁    If you want to be a millionaire someday,
鼓起勇气  做个决定吧    have some guts. Make a decision.
乔丹·贝尔福的方案很适合我    Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me
因为我很努力工作    because I worked hard for it.
如果对你不起作用  那就证明你太懒了    And if it doesn't work for you, it's because you're lazy.
你只配在麦当劳工作    And you should get a job at McDonald's.
没有人能在财政独立上拖你后腿    There's nobody holding you back from financial freedom.
也没有人能阻止你挣大钱    And there's nobody stopping you from making millions.
坐在家里  无所事事    Don't just sit at home,
只会让你想要的生活与你失之交臂    or the life of your dreams will sail right past you.
我改变了这些人的命运  也能改变你的    I changed all these people's lives and I can change yours, too!
来参加我的研讨会吧    So come to my seminar!
你梦想中的生活    The life of your dreams is only...
好久不见  乔丹    Good to see you again, Jordan.

日内瓦有上万个瑞士银行家    There had to be 10,000 Swiss bankers in Geneva,

让自己在美国本土上被逮捕的笨蛋    enough to get himself arrested on U.S. Soil.
我知道    I know.
很抱歉    I'm so sorry.
更扯淡的是    Even more fucked was that
他被逮捕  跟我一点关系都没有    he got busted for shit that had nothing to do with me.
跟我没有半毛钱关系    It had nothing to fucking do with me.
说是一起通过海外龙舟赛    Something about laundering drug money
进行的贩毒洗钱事件    through offshore boat racing
一个叫洛奇·青木的人    and a guy named Rocky Aoki,
红花餐馆创始人    you know, the founder of Benihana.
红花餐馆    Benihana.
红你个头啊    Beni-fucking-hana!
为什么    Why?
为什么啊  老天爷    Why, why, God?
你为什么那么残忍    Why would you be so cruel
要我和一家铁板烧连锁餐厅    as to choose a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants
一起倒台    to take me down?
长话短说  索雷尔把我供了出来    Long story short. Saurel rats me out.
但他首先供出了布拉德的老婆  仙黛尔    But not before he rats out Brad's wife, Chantalle,
结果发现    who, it turns out,
她每次去瑞士  都要跟他通奸    he'd been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!
-不不不  这不可能  -是的是的    - No, no, no, it's impossible. - Oui, oui, oui.

我恨死那只狗了    I hate that fucking dog.
是啊  老了  变得毫无节制    Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.
又开始在家里随地大小便了    Starting to shit in the house again.
-我也是  -抱一个  兄弟    - Me, too. - Come here, buddy.
-很高兴见到你  兄弟  -我也是    - It's good to see you, pal. - Yeah, you, too.
很高兴见到你  坐吧    Good to see you. Sit down. Oh, man.
过得怎样  兄弟    How you doing, brother?
你懂的    You know.
糟透了  兄弟    Shitty, pal.
但还是能撑住的    But I'm hanging in there.
看看我的新脚链    My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.
不能踏出家里半步    Can't leave the house, you know?
都快得幽居病了    Starting to get cabin fever already.
该死的鲁格拉特    Fucking Rugrat.

就不该相信那混球  真想杀了他    I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him.

不负责任的贱货    Irresponsible little prick.

不管是谁的生日    I'm never eating at Benihana again.
我都不去红花餐馆吃饭了    I don't care whose birthday it is.
内奥米在哪  她还好吧    Where's Naomi? How's she doing?
在哪边    That's her in the house there.
你跟她打招呼  估计她也不会理你    You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back.
亲爱的内奥米    Naomi, sweetheart!
她怎么了    What's up her ass?
-她在生我的气吗  -不  你懂的    - Is she mad at me? - No, you know...
为了交保释金    We probably have to mortgage the house
我们应该要把房子抵押了    in order to make bail.
或许还要卖些东西    Probably end up selling the
才能给律师们发工资    thing in order to pay for all the lawyers.
说实话  这真是一场噩梦  兄弟    It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth.
要不然能怎么办呢  对吧    What are you gonna do, right?
斯特拉顿才是重点  情况如何    Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important.
士气如何    How's morale?
现在要合法挣钱  他们都气坏了吧    They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now?
乔丹    Jordan.
我把创始人都找来了    I got the founding partners together.
跟他们说明了情况    I talked to them about everything.
有我在呢    And I got you.
有你在是什么意思    What do you mean, you got me?
房子和钱的事都别担心  有我在    The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you.
-好了  -我爱你  兄弟    - All right. - I love you, buddy.
-我也会为你这样做的  -我知道    - You know I'd do it for you, right? - I know.

真想亲遍你全身    I could fucking kiss you all over.

想喝啤酒吗  兄弟    You want a beer, pal?
你在喝什么    What are you drinking?
不含酒精的东西    I got this non-alcoholic shit.
那是什么    What's that?
不含酒精的啤酒    A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.
-是啤酒吗  -是的  不含酒精    - It's a beer? - Yeah, with no alcohol.
如果你喝多了    But if you drink enough,
如果你喝很多的话  还是会醉吗    if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up?
不会的  不含酒精  这才是重点    No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point.
我不是科学家    I'm not a scientist.
不知道你在说什么    I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
你想喝啤酒的话  我可以给你拿    I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer.
我知道  但是我不喝酒了  记得吗    I know, but I don't drink. You remember?
我已经戒酒了    I don't drink anymore.
你想进屋里吸点发酵粉吗    Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder?
或者是苏打粉    Or baking soda.
无法想象再也不能嗑嗨的日子啊    Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.
-是啊  -我爱死那些日子了    - Yeah. - I love it.
戒酒的日子怎样    How's being sober?
-糟糕透了  -很无聊  对吧    - Fucking sucks. - Boring, right?
无聊到我想自杀了    So boring. I wanna kill myself.
有个词  我们不太想用    There's a term, and we don't like to use it
除非在特殊情况下    unless circumstances dictate,
我认为这个案子够特殊的了    and I think they do dictate in this case,
那个词就是  格林纳达    and the term is "Grenada."
你听说过格林纳达吗    Have you ever heard of Grenada?
没听过    No. No, I haven't.
格林纳达是个很有趣的小岛国    Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation
1983年的时候被美国侵略    that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983.
大约有九万人    It's about 90,000 people.
换句话说    And essentially, it means
这个案子我们不可能输    this case is unloseable.
懂吗    Okay?
也就是说    So, you know,
就算我们光着裤子走上法庭    we can come in, we can have our dick hanging out of our pants.
也没有人会在乎    Nobody gives a fuck.
我赢定了    I'm gonna win.
而你呢    You, sir,
就是格林纳达    are what's known as a Grenada.
你就等着判刑吧    You're looking at real prison time.
洗钱至少要吃20年牢饭    Money laundering can get you as much as 20 years.
如果不是抓到你往海外塞钱    And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you
这案子也不会那么简单    shoving cash in your mattress.
真的吗    Is that right?
乔丹    Hey, Jordan. Jordan.
你要在牢里等死  直到孩子大学毕业    Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college,
那并不是我们的目的    that's not our ambition here.
还有其他人参与洗钱的勾当    There's other people involved in this, too.
我们认为他们也应该被送上法庭    We think they need to see their day in court as well.
我怎么觉得你们是要提条件呢    Why do I sense there's an offer in the air?
你看他多聪明  你是心灵感应大师吗    Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin?
全面配合  也就是过去七年间    Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list
所有同谋的详细名单提供给我们    of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years,
还要同意带窃听器    and he also agrees to wear a wire.
等会    Wait...
你刚才说让我"带窃听器"吗    did you just say "wear a wire"?
窃听器    A wire.
什么意思    What does that mean?
你想让我告密  是吗    You want me to rat? Is that it?
不  我想让你合作    No, I want you to cooperate.
不  你就是想让我告密    No. You want me to rat, right?
没错  就是让你告密    Yes. We want you to rat.
我们还就他妈的想让你干这件事  告密    That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat.
克里斯蒂的派对怎么样    How was Cristy's party?
不错    Fine.
那就好    Good.
宝贝  我今天又去见过律师了    Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today.
我有非常非常好的消息要告诉你    I have some really, really great news.
看来这件事完全不会涉及到你  亲爱的    Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey.
这我早就知道    I know that already.
没错  也是    Right. Exactly.
你本来也就没做过什么错事  对吧    You never did anything wrong in the first place, right?
闹了半天  联邦调查局    It turns out, all the FBI really
真正想让我做的就是跟他们合作    wants from me is to cooperate.
你知道吗    You know?
因为我手上掌握了很多    Turns out I have so much
关于股票市场和华尔街的内幕    information about the stock market and Wall Street,
我可以给政府省好几年的心    I could save the government years of heartache,
更别提数以百万的经济损失了    not to mention countless dollars.
但是更好的还在后头呢  宝贝    But it gets even better, babe.
如果我决定跟他们合作的话    Because if I do decide to cooperate,
我只能只需要蹲个短短四年就行了    I might only be looking at four short years,
这样一来    in which case, you know,
我们可以重新来过  也许把房子卖了    we could start fresh, maybe sell the house.
我要交的任何罚款    And any fines that I'd have to pay
也是等到我刑满出狱后才用交    wouldn't be due till after I serve my term,
所以我们还会剩下很多钱    so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know?
当然了  唯一让我有点不爽的就是    The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit
他们想让我    is this whole idea of
提供关于我朋友的信息    having to give information about my friends.
你不是说过"华尔街上无朋友"吗    Like you said, "There's no friends on Wall Street." Right?
是的  是的  没错    Right. Right. Exactly.
这件事也有好的一面  亲爱的    There's a silver lining to that, too, honey.
因为他们说最终    Because they said eventually...
最终所有人    eventually everyone's
都必须提供关于这个案件的信息    gonna have to give information on this case.
所以到了最后    So, at the end of the day,
我告密的事也不算什么了    it might not even be a factor. You know?
这是好消息  对吧    Well, that's good news. Right?
没错  没错    Yeah, yeah.
我真为你高兴    I'm really happy for you.
什么叫为我高兴啊  亲爱的    What do you mean, happy for me, sweetheart?
你应该为咱俩高兴啊  对吧    You should be happy for the both of us. Right?
-没错  -好的    - Yeah, right. - All right.
过来  宝贝    Come here, baby.
亲亲我  甜心    Give me a kiss, sweetheart.
乔丹    Jordan...
来吧  宝贝    Oh, come on, baby.
我都好久没跟你做爱了  求你了    I haven't made love to you in so long. Please.
-乔丹  不要  -亲爱的  求你了    - No. Jordan, stop it. - Come on, honey, please.
不要  乔丹  够了    No! Jordan, stop it!
我第一眼看到你就爱上你了    I've loved you since the moment I saw you.
我他妈的恨死你了  乔丹    I fucking hate you, Jordan.
-给我下去  -宝贝  别这样    - Get off me! - Baby... don't do that.
你知道我有多爱你  对吧    You know how much I love you, right?
别这样对我了  亲爱的  求你了    Stop that, sweetie. Please.
你想上我吗  乔丹    You wanna fuck me, Jordan?
你想上我吗    You wanna fuck me?
很好    Good.
来吧    Go ahead.
尽管来上我吧    Go ahead and fuck me.
我要你狠狠地上我    I want you to fuck me real hard.
我要你把这当成是最后一次一样操我    I want you to fuck me like it's the last fucking time.
-你为什么要这么动  -来啊    - Why are you moving like that? - Come on.
别动    Please hold still.
因为我想让你射给我啊  宝贝    'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.
来啊  宝贝    Come on, babe.
射给我啊  宝贝啊    Come for me, baby.
我要你把这当做是最后一次一样    I want you to come for me

-是吗  -是    - Yeah? - Yeah.
来啊  宝贝  射给我  宝贝    Come on, baby. Come for me. Come for me, baby.
来啊  宝贝    Come on, baby.
-你喜欢这样  -是啊    - Yeah? - Yeah.

天啊  天啊    Oh, God. Oh, God.
天啊    Oh, God.
上帝啊    Jesus.
宝贝    Oh, baby.
真是爽死了    That was so fucking great!
天啊    Oh, God!
这是最后一次了    That was the last time.
什么意思  宝贝    What do you mean, baby?
我是说  刚才那就是我们的最后一次了    I mean that was the last time we ever have sex.
你在说什么呀    What are you talking about?
我要离婚    I want a divorce.
你这是什么意思  你要离婚    What do you mean, you want a divorce?
你在说什么啊  你要离婚    What's that supposed to mean, you want a divorce?
放开我  我要跟你离婚    Get off me! I want a divorce.
你刚刚才跟我上完床    You just made love to me.
你他妈的是什么毛病啊    What the fuck is wrong with you?
我不爱你了  乔丹    I don't love you anymore, Jordan!
你不爱我了    Oh, you don't love me?
你已经不爱我了    You don't love me anymore, huh?
你还真会挑时候啊    Well, isn't that just fucking convenient for you!
我现在被联邦政府起诉    Now that I'm under federal indictment,
脚脖子上还绑着个电子监控器    with an electronic bracelet around my ankle,
然后你他妈的决定不爱我了    now you decide you don't fucking love me anymore.
-是吗  -不  不    - Is that right? - No, no.
你到底是什么人啊  说啊    What kind of person are you? Tell me.
是你娶的我    You married me!
你这话是他妈的什么意思    What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
乔丹  接下来这么安排    Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.
孩子的监护权归我    I'm gonna take custody of the kids.
你同意离婚  我还可以让你探望孩子    If you agree to the divorce right now, I will allow visitation.
-好吗  你别想着跟我争  -天啊    - Okay? Don't try to fight it. - Oh, my God.
我们好聚好散  也能给咱俩省点钱    It'll save us both a lot of money
而且我觉得你以后用钱的地方还多着呢    and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.
你别想带走我的孩子  亲爱的    You're not taking my kids, sweetheart. You hear me?
我已经找律师问过了    I've already talked to the lawyer.
他说就算你不被定罪    He said even if you don't get convicted,
孩子的监护权归我的可能性也很大    I've got a good chance of getting them.
我告诉你    I got news for you.
你他妈的别想带走我的孩子    You're not fucking taking my children,
你这个恶毒的荡妇    you vicious fucking cunt, you!

为什么  这是搞什么    Why? What the fuck's going on?
你要去蹲监狱了    You're going to jail.
好吧    All right.
我去穿衣服    I'll get some clothes on.
我们帮你    We'll give you a hand with that.
好吧    Okay.
联邦调查局    FBI!
所有人坐下    Everybody sit down.
把手举起来  不许出声    Put your hands where they can be seen, and shut up!
你他妈的别碰我    Don't you fucking touch me.
你他妈的放开我    Get your fucking hands off me!
不许离开你们的座位    Don't get out of your seats!
这他妈的可是香奈儿    It's fucking Chanel!
我告发了所有人    I gave up everyone.
作为回报    And in return,
我在内华达的一个我从来没听说过的    I got three years in some
鬼地方蹲了三年    hellhole in Nevada I'd never even heard of.
就像我父亲疯狂麦克斯曾经说过的    Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,
"恶有恶报"    "The chickens had come home to roost."
随便他什么意思吧    Whatever the fuck that means.
我希望法官大人认同    I hope Your Honor would agree
贝尔福先生在跟联邦调查局合作方面    that Mr. Belfort has distinguished himself
有出色的表现    in terms of his cooperation.
在贝尔福先生的协助下    Mr. Belfort has helped the government win convictions
政府给二十四余名重罪犯定了罪    of over two dozen serious offenders
并且追回了成百上千万美金    and helped them recover millions of dollars
用以补偿受害者    to be made available for restitution to their victims.
法庭对被告的判决为    The sentence of the court shall be
在联邦监狱关押三十六个月    36 months in federal prison.
请把被告押回去    Please remand the defendant.
抱歉    I'm sorry.
没关系    That's okay.
我承认  当我们到监狱的时候    I'm not ashamed to admit it.
我快吓死了    When we arrived at the prison,
我不觉得这有什么丢人的    I was absolutely terrified.
贝尔福  站起来    Belfort, on your feet.
但实际上我用不着害怕    But I needn't have been.
有那么很短的一瞬间    You see, for a brief fleeting moment,
我忘了自己曾富得流油了    I'd forgotten I was rich.
而我住在消费的世界里    And I lived in a place where everything was for sale.
你难道不想学一下怎么把它们卖掉吗    Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?
听好了  我这辈子见过不少混蛋    So listen. I've met some bad motherfuckers in my life.
摇滚明星  专业运动员  黑帮分子    I'm talking about rock stars, professional athletes, gangsters.
真的是一些坏得透顶的混蛋    I'm telling you, some real bad motherfuckers.
但是这家伙  我的好朋友    But this guy, my good friend,
乔丹·贝尔福先生真的是    Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single
我这辈子遇见过的最最最最最坏的混蛋了    baddest motherfucker I have ever met.
