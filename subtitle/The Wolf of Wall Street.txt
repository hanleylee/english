赚了4900万

还差300万就是一周赚100万了
because it was three shy of a million a week.

不不不   我的法拉利是白色的
No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,

和《迈阿密风云》里唐·约翰逊的一样
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

我每天吃的药量足够把
Yup, on a daily basis I consume enough drugs

曼哈顿  长岛和皇后区放倒一个月

But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,

有一种我最为爱不释手
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

嗑够了这鬼东西你就所向披靡了

足以征服全世界
Able to conquer the world,

杀得敌人片甲不留

我说的不是这个
And I'm not talking about this.

我说的是这个
I'm talking about this.

金钱不仅能给你带来更好的生活
See, money doesn't just buy you a better life,

更精美的食物  更好的车  更美的妞

还能让你成为更好的人

回头看看过去
So let me go back.

22岁的我  刚结婚
I'm 22 years old, newly married,

就已经是个追名逐利的小混蛋了
and already a money-crazed little shit.

那我怎么办呢
So what do I do?

我去了唯一一个
I go to the one place on earth

能满足我野心的地方
that befit my high-minded ambitions.

我爱你
I love you.

你的地位还不如水藻

有什么意见吗
You got a problem with that,

乔丹
Jordan?

没  完全没有
No. No problem at all.

很好  因为你现在就这地位

水藻
Pond scum.

你的工作是联络员
Your job is connector,

也就是说
which means

你每天要打500多次电话
that you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day

想法让我联系上有钱的大老板
trying to connect me with wealthy business owners.

在你考下证券经纪人执照前
And until you pass your Series 7,

你他妈也只能干这个  坐下
that is all you're gonna fucking be doing. Sit.

坐下
Sit!

我告诉你  我去年赚了30多万

你的另一个头儿  他赚了100多万
The other guy you'll be working for, he made over a million.

我看你已经见过那个地头蛇了

拨号并微笑
Smile and dial.

1点前别他妈抬头
And don't pick up your fucking head until 1:00.

甭管他
Hey, fuck him.

我才是高级经纪人
I'm the senior broker here.

他就是个当差的
He's just a worthless piker.

来给我吹个箫吧  汉纳
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

你真在面试的时候卖出去一股吗
Now did you really pitch a stock in your job interview?

想脱颖而出总得干点实事
I had to do something to stand out.

是吧  先生
Right, sir?

就喜欢你这样的
I fucking love that.

如果我们不在9点半整立刻开始打电话
We don't start dialing at 9:30

干起来吧
Let's fuck!

你想知道金钱听上去什么样吗
You want to know what money sounds like?

去华尔街的交易大厅听听吧
Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.

操这个日那个的
"Fuck" This, "Shit" That.

这些人说的话简直让我难以置信
I couldn't believe how these guys talked to each other.

-这一揽子交易真他妈好  -烂狗屎

我当时就着迷了
I was hooked in seconds.

跟打了鸡血似的
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

混账  看看今天股票怎么样

日你妈
You motherfucker,

要是44你什么也捞不到
you can't get any at 44...

-快他妈打电话去  -抱歉
- Pick up the cocksucking phone! - Sorry...

你真是个臭傻逼  汉纳
You are such a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

我们才不管什么技术
We don't give two shits about how technology works

我们只关心他妈怎么能赚钱
because all we care about is getting fucking rich.

-定了  2000  -乔丹·贝尔福
- Solid, 2,000. - Jordan Belfort.

可卡因来点
Tootski?

不用了  谢谢
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

汉纳先生
Mr. Hanna,

这么美好的午后  您要来点什么
what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

赫克托  我告诉你怎么玩
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

给我们上两杯马丁尼
You're gonna bring us two Absolut Martinis.

你知道我的口味  要纯的
You know how I like them. Straight up.

整7分半后
And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that,

再上两杯
you're gonna bring us two more.

然后每5隔分钟上两杯
Then two more after that every five minutes

直到我俩喝倒一个为止
until one of us passes the fuck out.

这想法不错  先生
Excellent strategy, sir.

我现在喝水就好
I'm good with water for now.

谢谢
Thank you.

他今天刚来华尔街工作
It's his first day on Wall Street.

他会习惯的
Give him time.

-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

汉纳先生
Mr. Hanna?

你白天嗑了药
You're able to do drugs during the day

还能正常工作吗
and then still function, still do your job?

不然你以为怎么正常工作
How the fuck else would you do this job?

就凭可卡因和妓女了  哥们
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

是
Right.

我想说
Well, I got to say,

能加入你们我真的很高兴
I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean...

你们的客户实在是...
The clients you have are absolutely...

去他妈的客户
Fuck the clients.

你唯一的职责就是引他们上钩
Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table.

你有女朋友吗
You got a girlfriend?

我结婚了
I'm married. I have a wife.

我妻子叫泰瑞莎  理发的
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

-恭喜  -谢谢
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

多想想泰瑞莎
Think about Teresa.

你要干的就是
Name of the game.

把你客户兜里的钱揣到你兜里
Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket.

是
Right.

但如果同时能帮客户赚钱
But if you make your clients money at the same time,

不是互惠互利吗
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

不
No.

华尔街第一要义
Number one rule of Wall Street.

没有人
Nobody...

不管你是沃伦·巴菲特也好
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett

吉米·巴菲特也好
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

没人知道股票是涨是跌
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down,

是持平还是兜圈子
sideways, or in fucking circles.

股票经纪人更不知道  懂吗
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

都是掩的  你知道什么叫掩吧
It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is?

"赝"吗  就是假的
Fugayzie. It's a fake.

什么掩啊赝啊  嫖啊飘啊的
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

都是虚无缥缈的  根本不存在
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

看不见摸不着
It's never landed. It is no matter.

元素周期表上找不到
It's not on the elemental chart.

根本都他妈是假的
It's not fucking real.

-对不  -对
- Right? - Right.

继续听我讲
Stay with me.

我们屁都不创造  什么都不建
We don't create shit. We don't build anything.

的确
No.

所以假设你有个客户花8块买了一股
So if you got a client who bought stock at eight

现在涨到16了  他乐开花了
and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy.

就想兑现清算
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

拿上钱打包走人
take his fucking money and run home.

-这可不行  -好的
- You don't let him do that. - Okay.

-因为那样就成真钱了  -是
- 'Cause that would make it real. - Right.

那该做什么
No. What do you do?

你得继续给他出金点子
You get another brilliant idea.

额外的想法
A special idea.

制造另一种"情况"
Another "situation."

让他拿收益再投一支股票  不断投
Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some.

他每次也一定会投
And he will, every single time.

因为他们全都他妈是瘾君子
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

你就一直这么干
And you just keep doing this,

延绵不断  无休无止
again and again and again.

他这时觉得自己要成土豪了
Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich,

理论上他的确赚了
which he is, on paper.

但我们这些经纪人
But you and me, the brokers,

从中收的佣金
we're taking home cold hard cash

可都是实打实的现金  学着没
via commission, motherfucker.

是
Right.

这太神奇了  老板
That's incredible, sir.

我都激动的无以言表了
I can't tell you how excited I am.

你就该兴奋
You should be.

做经纪人这行的成功要素有两点
There's two keys to success in the broker business.

首先
First of all...

-你得淡定  -是
- You gotta stay relaxed. - Yeah.

你平时撸吗
Do you jerk off?

撸...撸吗
Do I... Do I jerk off?

撸  撸啊  我当然撸
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

每周几次
How many times a week?

三四次吧
Like three or four.

三四次  有时五次
Three or four times, maybe five.

你得多撸啊
Gotta pump those numbers up.

干这行  你这次数太菜鸟了
Those are rookie numbers in this racket.

我本人吧  每天至少两发
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

早晨健身之后来一发
Once in the morning right after I work out,

午饭后再来一发
then once right after lunch.

真的吗
Really?

我喜欢撸  但我撸不是因为喜欢
I want to. That's not why I do it.

全他妈是被逼的
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

你想想  你是跟数字打交道的
Think about it. You're dealing with numbers.

整天都是什么小数点啊  高频交易啊
All day long, decimal points, high frequencies.

全他妈是数
Fucking digits.

每天重任在肩  喘不过气啊
All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

对吧
All right?

太让人抓狂了  是吧
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

所以就得多撸  保持血液流通顺畅
You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing.

私底下控制住节奏
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

懂了
Done.

我这可不是提醒你  我给你开处方呢
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

相信我
Trust me.

你不这么干  就没法平衡了
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

差额搞不清楚你就载了
split your differential and tip the fuck over.

还有更糟的
Or worse yet,

我亲眼见过  猝死
I've seen this happen, implode.

别介  我可不想猝死  老板
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

当然  没人想
No. No, you don't.

我干这行看得很长远的
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

-猝死可不是什么好事  -是
- Implosions are ugly. - Yeah.

所以有空就去洗手间来一发
Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can.

等你撸顺手了
When you get really good at it,

一边撸着
you'll fucking be stroking it

一边脑子里想的都是钱
and you'll be thinking about money.

干这行成功要素之二
Second key to success in this racket

就是这瓶子里的宝贝
is this little baby right here.

叫可卡因
It's called cocaine.

是
Right.

能让你耳聪目明
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

还能让你拨号指速如飞
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

你猜怎么着
And guess what?

你拨号快了  我就赚了
That's good for me.

好了  先生
Yes, sir.

周转不息  明白吗
Revolutions. You follow?

周转不息
Revolutions.

让客户坐上摩天轮
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

我们就开赚
And it goes.

游乐园365天全天候给他开着
The park is open 24/7, 365,

十年如一日  百年也他妈这样
every decade, every goddamn century.

就这么回事
That's it.

这就是游戏规则
The name of the game.

尝尝希腊橄榄
Halkidiki?

谢谢
Thank you.

一起来
Come on.

我们是公分母
We're the common denominator.

继续
Keep it up for me.

你懂这回事
You've seen the echo

我们谈着钱
And the money comes in

游行进了城
The parade comes to town

走到百老汇
Going down Broadway

不管往哪去
It's a one-way street

都没回头路
Whichever way I go

之后的六个月
The next six months,

我开始了解华尔街的门道
I got to know the ins and outs of Wall Street.

边赚小钱边准备考执照
Earning shit money as I geared up to take my Series 7.

真他妈爽
Oh, fuckers.

后来我终于拿下了执照
Then I was a licensed broker at last,

准备开始挣大钱了
ready to make my fortune.

那天起我开始向未来宇宙之王迈进
My first day as a future Master of the Universe.

六个月前埃克森还是86块2毛5
I have Exxon at 86 and a quarter six months ago.

现在都跌到36块5了
Today it is trading at 36 and a half.

They called it Black Monday.

since the crash of '29.

我了解你的家庭  你也了解我的
I know your family, you know mine.

我不知道  欧洲某个傻逼国家干的
No, I don't know. Some fucking country in Europe took a shit.

让他们玩儿蛋去吧
Let them do what they want to fucking do.

我们的市场固若金汤
Our market's solid.

你不该卖掉这个
This is not something that you want to sell.

你知道怎么回事吗  简直金融海啸
You know what happened? A fucking tsunami.

我觉得你这样以后要后悔的
I think you're making a big mistake.

好  我可以和你妻子谈
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

相信我  别接电话
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

会有许多人给您致电
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,

要挖您的家丑
trying to get your dirty laundry.

我们不知道怎么回事
We don't know what's going on here.

我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

我了个
Holy

Wall Street had swallowed me up

又把我拉出来了
and shit me right back out again.

实在不行我们可以把订婚戒指当掉

你几周前寄了一张明信片到我公司
You mailed in my company a postcard a few weeks back

咨询上涨潜力巨大
requesting information on penny stocks that had

下跌风险极小的仙股吗
huge upside potential with very little downside risk.

还记得吗
Does that ring a bell?

我好像的确寄过
Yeah, I may have sent something.

太好了  约翰  我今天打电话给你
Okay, great. The reason for the call today, John, is,

因为我刚刚发现一支潜力股
something just came across my desk, John.

大概能算我半年来见过最棒的一支
It is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last six months.

我想跟你聊聊
If you have 60 seconds,

只要60秒  1分钟好吗
I'd like to share the idea with you. You got a minute?

我其实现在...
Actually, I'm really very...

公司名叫艾洛泰因国际

这是中西部一家尖端高科技公司

马上就将获得下一代

雷达探测器的专利许可
on the next generation of radar detectors

现在这种雷达探测器的

军用和民用价值都非常高
and civilian applications now.

就是现在  约翰
Right now, John,

直接交易股价10美分一股

还有  约翰  我们的分析师
And by the way, John, our analysts indicate

认为这支股票日后能涨上天
it could go a heck of a lot higher than that.

你只要投资6000块
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment

就能赚到6万块的收益

老天  我住房按揭就6万

这股票能帮我还清房贷
This stock will pay off my house?

约翰  就算股市这个样子
John, one thing I can promise you,

我也能向你保证一件事
even in this market,

那就是我从不让客户
is that I never ask my clients

关注我赌对的股
to judge me on my winners.

我让他们看我赌输的股票
I ask them to judge me on my losers

因为我赌输的太少了
because I have so few.

至于艾洛泰因
And in the case of Aerotyne,

基于目前所有的技术因素  约翰
based on every technical factor out there, John,

这绝对是满贯全垒打
we are looking at a grand slam home run.

行  投吧  我投4000块
Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.

4000美金  那就是4万股  约翰
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

我现在就去下单
Let me lock in that trade right now

然后让我秘书联系你
and get back to you with my secretary

其他人都目瞪口呆地看着我
The other guys looked at me

好像我刚发现了如何取火
like I'd just discovered fire.

好  那更好了
Great! Even better!

我把垃圾股卖给垃圾人
I was selling garbage to garbage men

自己赚了个盆满钵满
and making cash hand over fist.

你将来只有一个问题
The only problem you're gonna have

就是当初买太少了
is that you didn't buy more.

-我卖给别人的都是垃圾  -加油
- So I was selling them shit. - Way to go.

但在我看来
But the way I looked at it,

他们的钱在我口袋里更好
their money was better off in my pocket.

我更懂得怎么花钱

你开辆这么炫酷的车
You got your fucking nice car,

还跟我住同一栋楼里
we live in the same building. I just...

我有点想不通  你赚多少

你他妈
Get the fuck...

Get the fuck out of here.

我认真的
No, I'm serious.

我也是认真的

说真的  你到底赚多少
Seriously, how much money do you make?

我说了  七万
I told you. $70,000.

确切来说应该是七万二
Well, technically, $72,000.

上个月差不多就这么多吧
Last month. Something like that.

你一个月赚七万二吗
You made 72 grand in one month?

是的
Yeah.

我跟你说
I'll tell you what.

你把写着七万二的工资单拿给我看
You show me a pay stub for $72,000 on it,

我立马辞职跟你混
I quit my job right now and I work for you.

保利  你好啊
Hey, Paulie, what's up?

不  没事  都挺好的
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

我要辞职
Hey, listen, I quit.

他真的辞职了
And he did quit his job.

我觉得有点怪
Which I thought was a little weird.

我他妈才遇见这家伙
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.

别他妈告诉苏珊  跟她没关系
Don't fucking tell Susan. It's none of her business.

这人还不止这一件事奇怪
There were other things about him, too.

比如他白得发光的牙齿
Like his phosphorescent white teeth.

你老婆  我他妈还管你老婆
Wife! I gotta fucking deal with your wife?

他用角制镜架透明镜片
The fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses

就为了看着更像上层阶级
just to look more WASP-y.

还有那些流言
And then, there were these rumors.

我听到一些愚蠢的流言  怎么说呢
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

我操  我都不想提的  就是...
Fuck, I didn't even want to bring it up. It's just...

-蠢透了  -有关我的流言
- It's stupid. - Shit with me?

人们就喜欢说三道四  我都不知道
You know, people say shit. I don't even know.

半数时间我都不会去听
I don't even listen to it half the time.

他们说什么呢
What are they saying?

说你和你表妹的传言
Shit about you and your cousin or something like that.

我才不去听呢
I don't even listen to it.

老兄  不是他们说的那样
Bro, it's not like that.

不是的
It's not like that.

说你娶了你表妹什么的  没有吗
Like you married your cousin or some stupid shit. No?

是  我老婆
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

我老婆是我表妹
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

但不是你以为的那样
But it's not like what you think, or whatever, you know.

她是你的嫡表妹吗  还是...
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

对  不是  她是...
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

她爸
Her... Her father

是我妈的弟弟
is the brother of my mom.

不是那样的
It's not like, what... You know.

我们一起长大
Look, we grew up together.

她出落得很性感  真他妈性感
And she grew up hot, you know. She fucking grew up hot.

我朋友都想上她
And all my friends were trying to fuck her, you know.

我可不会让别人
And I'm not gonna let someone...

让这些傻逼上我表妹
You know, one of these assholes fuck my cousin,

我就用表哥的身份接近她
so, you know, I used the cousin thing as like an in with her.

我可不会让别人上我表妹
I'm not gonna let someone else fuck my cousin.

要有人上我表妹
You know, if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

那也得是我  出于尊重
it's gonna be me, out of respect. You know?

我明白
No, I get it. Yeah.

你不怕生孩子出事吗
I mean, you're not afraid of like the whole kid thing, right?

-什么  跟她生孩子吗  -是的
- What? Having kids with her? - Yeah.

不怕  我们有两个孩子了
No. We have two kids.

他们...
And they're... I mean...

这不是人身攻击  不过他们没事吗
I don't want to get personal, but they're okay?

没有  他们不是弱智之类的
No, they're not retarded or anything like that.

但很有可能吧...
But there's a big chance, right, if...

是啊  大概60%
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

60%到65%的机会孩子会是弱智
60% to 65% chance the kid's gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

我他妈吓尿了  老兄
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

不管操的是不是表妹
Look, man, a lot of having a kid, or whatever, takes risk,

生孩子都有风险
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

如果你的孩子真是弱智怎么办
What if something like that happened?

基本上  孩子要真是弱智
Basically, you know, if the kid was retarded,

我就开车到荒郊野外
I would, you know, drive it up to the country

打开车门然后说
and just, like, you know, open the door and say,

"你自由了"  "自由奔跑吧"之类的
"You're free now." You know, like, "Run free."

你懂的吧
You know?

你他妈逗我玩呢
You're completely fucking with me.

那太可怕了  你才不会...
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

你的样子好像...不会
You look like you've... No.

我们会带孩子去特殊机构什么的
We would take it to, like, an institution or somewhere

或是专门负责抚养孩子的地方
that's handled to, like, you know, raise the kid or whatever.

如果你很开心  那上帝保佑你
You know what? If you're happy, God bless you, buddy.

不  我他妈哪里开心了
No, I'm not fucking happy. No one who's married is fucking happy.

谁他妈结婚了还会开心啊
No one who's married is fucking happy.

听你这么说很遗憾  兄弟
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

我真的...
Listen, I'm really, you know...

我真的很感谢你给我这份工作
I'm really appreciative for this fucking job.

我真的很喜欢
I'm really enjoying it.

我很满意你现在的表现
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

我给你准备了一份礼物
Actually, I got you a little present.

-你给我准备了礼物  -一点小心意
- You got me a present? - I got you something.

妈的  你真好
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

不过在酒吧后面
Yeah. It's in the back though.

-什么意思  -你得去后面
- What do you mean? - You gotta go out back.

是礼物包起来了吗
Like it's wrapped up or something?

对  包起来了
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

-我不明白  -我也不明白

我和搭档想租用你的汽修厂
My partner and I are very interested in renting out your garage.

我和唐尼辞职单干了
Donnie and I were going out on our own.

首先我们需要的就是经纪人
And the first thing we needed was brokers.

有销售经验的人
Guys with sales experience.

所以我招募了几个老乡
So I recruited some of my hometown boys.

西·奥特  卖肉和大麻的
Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.

切斯特  卖轮胎和大麻的
Chester, who sold tires and weed.

还有罗比  能弄到什么就卖什么
And Robbie, who sold anything he could get his hands on.

基本都是大麻
Mostly weed.

能给我拿点番茄酱来吗
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

这是布拉德
This is Brad.

我真想要的就是布拉德
And Brad's the guy I really wanted.

但他不愿意加入我们
But he didn't go along with us.

他卖安眠酮已经赚飞了
He was already making so much money selling Quaaludes,

算是贝赛地区的安眠酮小王子
he'd become the Quaalude king of Bayside.

你这玩意儿操上逼了没
Getting any pussy with that thing or what?

当然  伙计
Yeah, man, of course.

有空也带几个妞儿来我这转转
Bring some of them chicks around here sometime, huh?

让她们瞧瞧
Let 'em watch.

让她们见识见识  懂我意思吗
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

小老二  代我向你姐姐问好
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister I was asking about her.

下次来我这的时候
Why don't you bring me a pair of her panties

带条她的内裤吧
next time you come through.

伙计  她说这辈子也不想见你了
Yeah, man. She said she don't want to talk to you anymore, man.

你他妈滚吧
Get the fuck out of here.

妈  今儿有鸡肉没
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

妈
Ma!

听见没  比你们想象的还容易
You listening? It's easier than you think.

每个接你电话的人
Every person you're on the phone with,

都做着一夜暴富的梦
they want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly.

都想空手套白狼
They all want something for nothing.

我有次
There was this one time

把口锅卖给门诺会教徒了
that I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

就是那种留着鬓须
You know those guys who got like the beard

但嘴唇上不留胡子的
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

他就说他这辈子只想做家具
Well, he says that he only wants to make furniture.

-没懂你意思  -这和我们说的有什么关系
- I don't understand. - What's that got to do with anything?

你他妈扯哪儿去了
What the fuck are you talking about?

不是我逼你说什么
I'm not putting words in your mouth or nothing,

但你刚说每人都想一夜暴富
but you just said that everybody wants to get rich.

我操  你刚确实说了
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

你们他妈扯哪儿去了
What the fuck are you talking about?

对啊  佛教徒也是  他们才不在乎钱
Yeah, like Buddhists. They don't give a shit about money.

他们只穿僧袍  也没什么花销
They're wrapped in sheets. They're not buying shit.

我又不是说佛教徒或门诺教徒
I'm not talking about Buddhists or Amish.

我是说普通人  工薪阶级  平凡群众
I'm talking about normal people, working-class, everyday people.

人人都想赚大钱  我说错了吗
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

那种超凡脱俗的人根本不存在
There's no such thing as an Amish Buddhist.

-我敢保证  -真的有
- I'm pretty fucking sure. - There could be.

能来点番茄酱吗  谢谢
Can we get some ketchup, please?

难道你们这帮人也不想挣钱吗
Do you guys not want to make money?

我想挣大钱啊
I want to make some money.

我他妈当然想挣钱
I want to make some fucking money, okay.

我什么都能卖
I can sell anything.

我都能把安眠酮卖给修道院的修女
Shit, I can sell ludes to a convent full of nuns,

让她们淫水泛滥高潮迭起
and get them so horny they'd be fucking each other.

要的就是这个态度  没你卖不掉的东西是吗
That's the attitude. You can sell anything?

来把这支笔卖给我
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

你不是什么都能卖吗  试试这个  来
You can sell anything. Sell that. Go ahead.

把这支笔卖给我
Sell me the pen.

等我吃完行吗  一天没吃饭了
Can I finish eating first? I haven't eaten today.

布拉德  教教他们该怎么做
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

把这支笔卖给我  都看好了  开始
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

你要我把这破笔卖给你
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

这才是我哥们儿  什么都能卖
That's my boy right there. Can fucking sell anything.

帮我个忙
Why don't you do me a favor.

把你名字写那张餐巾纸上
Write your name down on that napkin for me.

可我没有笔呀
I don't have a pen.

卖给你了  这叫供需关系  伙计
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

-简直了  -我说什么来着
- Holy shit. - See what I'm saying?

他知道制造需求
He's creating urgency.

让他们心甘情愿去买股票
Get them to want to buy the stock.

让他们相信这是不可或缺的  明白吗
Convince them it's something they need, you know what I mean?

关键就在这
And that's the thing.

修女全是同性恋
All nuns are lesbians.

你他妈又扯到哪儿去了  海獭
What the fuck are you talking about, Otter?

想想看  在修道院钓不到凯子
Think about it. They can't keep a dude

只好玩女人喽
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

我喊了四遍了  几米  第四遍了
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

他没跟上我们的思路
He's not with us.

她终于拿来了
Now she runs.

这帮人是没念过哈佛工商管理硕士什么的
But look. I knew these guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.

罗比·范伯格  外号笨蛋
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,

用了5年才高中毕业
took five years to finish high school.

奥尔登·古佛博格  外号海獭  高中都没念完
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter, didn't even graduate.

切斯特·明  外号颓废华人
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,

一直以为柔道是以色列人发明的
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

当中最聪明的要属尼基·克斯考夫
Smartest of the bunch was Nicky Koskoff.

他还真上过法学院
He actually went to law school.

我叫他鲁格拉特因为他那顶傻逼假发
I called him Rugrat because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

就算来的是一群年轻  饥渴的蠢货
Still, give them to me young, hungry and stupid,

要不了多久我都能让他们发财
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

我的天
Oh, my God.

乔丹  这
Jordan, that...

喜欢吗  宝贝
You like it, baby?

天哪  太漂亮了
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

这不是世界上最大的钻石
They're not the biggest stones in the world,

但我保证这都是上等货
but I promise they're really high quality.

很漂亮
It's beautiful.

真的很漂亮
They're so beautiful.

天哪
Oh, boy.

怎么了
What?

我见过你这副表情  怎么了  说吧
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

不知道  就是
I don't know, it's... You know...

这些股票  这些公司
These stocks... These companies...

都是一些不入流的公司啊
They're like crappy companies.

-没错  -是吧
- Well, yeah. - Okay.

没错  它们都糟透了
Yeah, they're terrible.

别担心  不是告诉过你吗
Don't worry about it. I told you,

我做的都是合法生意
what I'm doing is completely legal.

我知道
Yeah, I know.

但那些投资人其实挣不到钱  对吗
But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right?

时有时无吧
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

投资本来就是这样的
You know how it goes.

那把这种股票卖给
Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people

不在乎这点小钱的富人不会更好吗
who can, like, afford to lose all that money?

当然
Of course.

但有钱人是不会买仙股的
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

事实就这样
They just don't.

为什么
Why not?

因为他们都混成精了
Because they're too smart, that's why not.

只要是读过大学的人
I mean, what person with a college education

有谁会相信这群混混呢
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

把电话挂了  说一会打回去
Hang up the phone. Tell him you'll call him back.

我他妈这正谈着5000块的生意呢
I got five fucking grand on the phone right now!

不过要是他们听起来不像混混呢
But what if they didn't sound like a bunch of jerk-offs?

如果我教会他们怎么向有钱人推销呢
What if I could teach them how to sell to people with money?

真正的有钱人
Real money.

所以我决定重新打造整个公司
So I decided to reinvent the company.

先生们  欢迎来到斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特
Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

你们现在的目标是拿下美国那1%的首富
You schnooks will now be targeting the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

要捞就要捞大鱼
We're talking about whales here.

就他妈《白鲸记》里那种
Moby fucking Dicks.

这份推销词  就是你们的鱼叉
And with this script, which is now your new harpoon,

我将教会你们每一个人
I'm gonna teach each and every one of you

如何成为他妈的亚哈船长
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

懂了吗
Get it? Huh?

什么船长
Captain who?

亚哈船长  就他妈的是
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

那本书里来的  你这蠢货  书里的
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

动动你的脑子
Turn your fucking brain on.

-去你妈的  -我操  罗比
- Fuck you. - Jesus fuck, Robbie.

听我说  我们这家新公司有说法的
Listen to me. We're a new company with a new name.

一家让客户放心的公司
A company that our clients can believe in.

一家让客户信任的公司
A company that our clients can trust.

一家在华尔街根基深厚的公司
A firm whose roots are so deeply embedded into Wall Street

当年的创始人乘着五月花号破浪而来
that our very founders sailed over on the Mayflower

将斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特这个名字
and chiseled the name Stratton Oakmont

镌刻在普里茅斯的坚岩上
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

明白了吗
You got it?

我们的具体计划是
What we're gonna do is this.

我们先推销像迪斯尼  ATT  IBM
First we pitch 'em Disney, ATT, IBM,

这种蓝筹热门股
blue chip stocks exclusively.

他们熟知的这种大公司
Companies these people know.

等他们放松警惕  我们就开始卖狗屎
Once we've suckered them in, we unload the dog shit.

粉单和仙股才是我们的聚宝盆
The pink sheets, the penny stocks, where we make the money.

我们从中抽五成呢  乖乖
50% commission, baby.

用这种策略盈利的关键在于
Now the key to making money in a situation like this

一定要先下手为强
is to position yourself now before the settlement.

等《华尔街日报》都报道了再行动
Because by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal,

就为时已晚了
it's already too late.

然后你要做的就是等待
Then you wait.

耐心等待
You wait.

谁先开口谁傻逼
And whoever speaks first loses.

抱歉
Sorry...

感谢您来电告知我
I appreciate the call.

我得考虑考虑
I really have to give this some thought

再和我太太商量一下
and talk to my wife about it.

我想好了再给您答复可以吗
Can I call you back?

他们在犹豫  对吧  他们得考虑考虑
They don't know, right? They gotta think about it,

得他妈问老婆
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,

或者去问他妈的牙仙什么的
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

但那些都不是关键
Point is, it doesn't matter what the fuck they say.

唯一让他们不敢砸钱的原因就是
The only real objection that they have

他们并不相信你们这帮人
is that they don't trust you guys.

他们凭什么相信你们  看看你们自己
And why should they trust you? I mean, look at you.

就一帮没文化的推销员  对吧
You're a bunch of fucking sleazy salesmen, right?

那你们该怎么办呢
So, what do you say?

要是我能让你7美元买进联合碳化物
You mean to tell me that if I put you in at Union Carbide at seven

再32美元卖出
and took you out at 32.

11美元买入德州仪器  47美元卖出
Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47.

16美元买入美国钢铁公司  41美元卖出
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41.

你现在肯定跟我说
You wouldn't be saying to me right now,

切斯特  快帮我给迪斯尼投几千股吧
"Chester, pick me up a few thousand shares of Disney!"

立刻  现在  赶快买
"On the spot, right now. Come on."

说真的  凯文  说真的  不是吗
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

我都不认识你
I don't know you.

你我陌不相识  你就给我电话陌生拜访
You cold-called me. You're a total stranger.

我表示完全同意
I am in complete agreement with you.

我们互不相识
You don't know me, I don't know you.

我不得不说  你听起来像是个
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

你像是个实诚人
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

It's not gonna make you rich and it's not gonna make you poor.

But what this trade will do is serve as...

未来交易的标杆  凯文
a benchmark for future business, Kevin.

现在说话舒服多了吧  斯科蒂
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

然后你就能确信了
And then you'll know for sure

自己终于在华尔街找了个能信赖的
that you finally found a broker on Wall Street

股票经纪人

你具体怎么打算的
What are you thinking?

凯文
Kevin.

给我一个机会
You give me one shot here

帮你投个柯达这样的蓝筹股
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

相信我  凯文
and believe me, Kevin,

之后你唯一会头疼的问题
the only problem you're gonna have

就是后悔当初没多买点
is that you didn't buy more.

听起来不错吧
Sound fair enough?

该死  我
Shit. My...

我老婆没准会踹了我  不过
My wife might divorce me, but...

成  来吧
Yeah, let's do it.

明智的选择  凯文
Excellent choice, Kevin.

这次你打算投多少钱
How much do you want to go for this time?

那就5...5000美元吧
Let's do five... $5,000.

多投点  8000怎么样  凯文
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

好吧  干脆投一万块
All right. Let's do 10.

-一万美元  -你觉得可行吗
- Ten. - You want to do that?

不能再明智了
Excellent choice!

凯文  我先去下单
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now,

几分钟之后再给你回电
and get back to you in a few minutes

进行确认  凯文
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

欢迎加入斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

This is fun.

放轻松  凯文
Take it easy, Kev.

谢了  乔丹  十分...
Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...

滚他妈的蛋吧
Fuck that motherfucker!

这还差不多
That's what I'm talking about!

真他妈是个傻逼
What a fucking idiot.

这世上我唯一了如指掌的就是航空行业了
The one thing I know about in this world is airlines.

酷尚航空绝对是航空领域的未来之星
And Cuchon Airlines is the future of airlines.

赶紧下手  不然...
Get in now or...

-我叫尼基·克斯考夫  -我叫切斯特·明
- I'm Nicky Koskoff. - Chester Ming.

我是斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特的高级副总裁
and I'm a Senior Vice President with Stratton Oakmont.

朱迪  这真是太不幸了
Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.

他什么时候去世的
When did he pass?

就算我预计错了  好吧
Just say I'm wrong, right.

股票跌几个点
And the stock goes down a couple points...

用我我祖父的话说  愿他的灵魂安息
And it makes you, in the words of my grandfather,

这绝对能让你赚上一坨钱
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

这就像还没太阳的时候
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

就投资给阳光  懂吗
before there was fucking sunlight. You understand?

买8000股怎么样
Can we do 8,000 shares?

好的  两万五千股
Okay, 25,000.

您的决定太明智了
That's a very intelligent decision.

我将把电话转接给我的销售助理
I'm gonna transfer you to my sales associate.

朗达
Rhonda!

-朗达  -我现在把电话转给安德烈
- Rhonda! - I'm gonna put you through to Andrea.

妈的有人看到朗达了吗
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

大家这周都过得不错吧
Everybody have a good week?

好
Yeah!

月末结算
The end of the month.

公司佣金净盈利2870万美元
$28.7 million in gross commissions,

全是粉单市场赚来的  伙计们
all from pink sheet stock, boys!

为了给本周的纵情声色助兴
And to celebrate with our weekly act of debauchery,

我愿给我们可爱的销售助理
I have offered our lovely sales assistant,

丹尼尔·哈里森小姐
Danielle Harrison, here,

一万美元  给她剃个秃瓢
$10,000 to shave her fucking head!

你们想看吗
Yeah, you want this?

你们想看吗
You want this?

剃光头  剃光头
Let's scalp her! Scalp her!

开始狂欢吧
Let the scalping begin!

光头  光头  光头
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

还有  各位  丹尼尔已经答应
FYI, boys, Danielle has promised to

会用这一万美元去隆胸了
use this $10,000 for breast implants!

她现在是C罩杯  不过就快变他妈D杯了
She's already got C cups, but now she wants fucking double D's!

还他妈有哪儿比我们公司更棒
Is this a great fucking company or what?

是不是世上最棒的公司
Is this the greatest company in the world?

唐尼
Donnie!

今天要他妈爽爆这个鬼地方
Blow the roof off this motherfucker!

还有香槟
Champagne?

派姑娘们进来
Send in the stripees!

我的
Mine!

整条华尔街都充斥着有关我们的传闻
Word about us spread throughout Wall Street.

甚至传到了我不愿传到的地方
Even the places I didn't want it to.

没过多久华尔街报社中的佼佼者
It wasn't long before Forbes magazine,

《福布斯》杂志社邀请我做个人专访了
the flagship of Wall Street, called to do a profile on me.

请问你认为斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特的未来会怎样
Let me ask you, how do you see the future for Stratton Oakmont?

一个词形容吗
One word?

多样化经营
Diversification.

挺好  十分感谢  我已经收获颇丰
Sounds good. Thank you so much. I have more than enough.

-感谢您百忙中抽出时间  -很好
- I appreciate your time. - Fantastic.

能给我们拍张照吗
Can we get a quick picture?

简直就他妈是恶意诋毁
A total fucking hatchet job.

这帮阴险的小杂种  读读这个
This conniving little twat! Look at this!

他们称我为"华尔街之狼"
"The Wolf of Wall Street" They call me. Look.

你发型不错
Your hair looks good.

-我的发型是不错  -是吧
- Well, my hair looks good. - Yeah.

乔丹·贝尔福就像个变态罗宾汉一样
"Jordan Belfort, sounding like a kind of twisted Robin Hood"

从富人处抢钱然后和一帮
"who takes from the rich and gives to himself,"

经纪人狐朋狗友分赃
"and his merry little band of brokers."

-读读  读读  -听着
- Read that. Read it. - Listen.

所有媒体炒作都是好事  亲爱的
There is no such thing as bad publicity, sweetheart.

你读下这篇  宝贝
Read the article, babe.

乔丹  你看着棒极了  你上了大杂志
Jordan, you look great! You're in a huge magazine.

看着棒极了管屁用
Big fucking deal I look great.

贝尔福  请看看我的简历
Mr. Belfort! Can you look at my resume, please?

抱歉  抱歉  先生
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

都他妈消停点儿
Calm the fuck down!

这他妈怎么回事
What the hell's all this?

都怪《福布斯》那篇报道
It's the Forbes article.

现在他们都想为你工作了
They all want to work for you now.

我怎么跟你说的
Hey! What did I say?

我只是想礼貌点
I'm just trying to be nice.

想工作  先找我
Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!

-贝尔福先生  -给我一分钟就好
- Mr. Belfort! - Give me one minute.

《福布斯》把我炒成了超级巨星
Forbes made me a superstar.

每天有无数做着发财梦的年轻人
Every day, dozens of money-crazed kids

踏破门槛来找我
beat a path to my door.

一旦应聘成功  他们立马就从大学退学
If we hired 'em, they dropped straight out of college overnight

从生活费里硬抠出一笔钱
and spent whatever allowance they had

买一套斯特拉顿定制裁缝的西装
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.

你们他妈是逗我玩吗
Are you fucking serious right now?

我们简直在亲手帮这帮孩子丰衣足食了
I mean, we were literally putting clothes on these kids' backs.

然后就被这个混蛋给盯上了
And here comes this jerk-off sniffing around.

不过这世上每次有人蒸蒸日上时
But, you know, every time someone rises up in this world,

总会有些傻逼想把他们拉下马
there's always gonna be some asshole trying to drag him down.

数月内  我们的规模就翻了番
Within months, we doubled in size,

迁进了更大的办公室
moved to even bigger offices.

公司整个就是一疯人院
It was a madhouse.

各种贪欲的狂欢
A greed-fest,\N

被可卡因  睾丸酮和体液均分
with equal parts cocaine, testosterone, and body fluids.

闹得越来越严重以至于我得规定
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone

早9点到晚7点不准在办公室操逼
between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.

但我告诉你  这都没用
But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.

其实我们进驻头一天就这么疯了
Actually, the madness started on our very first day,

我们的一个经纪人  本·詹纳
when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,

让一个销售助理给他口交
christened the elevator by getting a blowjob

给电梯破了处
from a sales assistant.

她叫帕姆  我得承认
Her name was Pam, and to her credit,

她的确技术超群
she did have this amazing technique,

会那种疯狂地套弄
with this wild twist and jerk motion.

过了差不多一个月
About a month later,

唐尼和我决定趁周六下午
Donnie and I decided to double-team her

我俩妻子去买圣诞礼服时
on a Saturday afternoon while our wives were out

和她来个二夹一
shopping for Christmas dresses.

后来本娶了她
Eventually, Ben married her,

我们都觉得挺神奇的
which was pretty amazing

因为她给办公室所有男的都吹过箫
considering she blew every single guy in the office.

本后来因为抑郁3年后自杀了
Then he got depressed and killed himself three years later.

我雇了我爸麦克斯做执行官来维持秩序
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max, to maintain order as the Enforcer.

斯特拉顿自己的盖世太保
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

我们叫他疯狂麦克斯因为他的急脾气
We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,

简直一触即发
which could be set off by

连电话铃这点小事都能惹到他
something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

谁这么厚颜无耻
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

周二晚上给我家打电话
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

真该死
God damn it!

你要错过片头了
You're gonna miss it!

拜托说点新鲜的
Please, tell me something I don't know.

我等一星期就为了看《均衡》
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

他们就非得这时候... 你好
and they have to fucking... Hello.

但一接起电话
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

吉尼  最近怎么样  吉尼
Gene. How are you, Gene?

他就开始用很奇怪的英国腔说话
... he'd affect this weird British accent.

好的  吉尼  那太好了
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

回见
Cheerio.

特别的奇怪
It was absolutely bizarre.

这该死的白痴
The fucking halfwit!

-等他挂了电话  -你错过片头了
- He'd hang up... - You missed it!

就又变回疯狂麦克斯了
... and then he's Mad Max all over again.

该死
Damn it!

告诉我刚讲什么了  怎么了
All right, tell me what happened. What happened?

他发现是他姑姑
Well, he discovered it was the mother's sister.

他是谁  告诉我是谁
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

主角啊  你知道主角...
The main guy. You know who the main...

主角
The main guy...

是他姑姑  他发现她死了
It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.

当然我们在斯特拉做的事情
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

不用都让疯狂麦克斯知道
everything we were doing at Stratton.

弄一个大的靶子  我们...
And then there's a big target and we...

把他们扔向靶子  然后就粘上了
They get launched at the target. They stick.

靶心里画个美元符号
There's a bull's-eye and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

扔得离靶心最近的
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

得分最高
gets the most points.

等着我把那小崩豆扔傻了
I'm gonna throw the shit out of this little fucking thing.

要是他受伤了怎么办
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

到时我们肯定很疯狂
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

我觉得我们伤不到他们  他们可...
I don't think he's gonna get hurt. They're like...

他们都结实得跟超人一样
They got like superhuman strength.

我觉得他不会有事的
I think he's gonna be fine.

你别瞪着他眼睛看就行
You can't look him right in the eyes.

别瞪着他眼睛看
You can't look him in the eye?

认真的  我看PBS台说的
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

他们会被你看毛然后发疯的
They get confused and their wires get crossed.

你得看着他们的下巴
You gotta look at their chin.

看着像是我在看你
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

但其实我在看你下巴
but I'm looking at your chin.

我感觉你在跟我说话
I feel like you're addressing me right now,

但你没在跟我说话吧
but you're not, are you?

他们就像蒙娜丽莎一样  不管你站哪里
They're like the Mona Lisa. They find eye contact,

他们都能直视你
like, wherever you are standing in the room.

然后就锁定了
And they lock in.

但我们还是有个限度的对吧
No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them?

可以向他们身上扔东西
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

我们可以扔吃的吗  香蕉
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

随便什么吃的  没错
Any food. Correct.

但举个例子  我就不大会
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

让他把鸡巴掏出来
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

然后找几个妹子
and like get some of the girls to, you know,

玩他什么的
fondle him and shit like that.

那也...不能这么干吗
That would be... That's unacceptable?

这招我们先留着
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

这人比较适合往靶子上扔
This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard.

对  对  没错
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

他们就适合干这个使
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

天生就适合被拿来当飞镖扔
They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart.

跟飞镖一样头重脚轻
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

就是为了让你能投准的
So they're built for accuracy.

天哪  我们能把他滚着玩么
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

那是他兄弟  罗比
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

罗比才是保龄球
His brother's the bowling ball.

给他身上绑个滑板
The brother, you put a skateboard on him,

把他绑在滑板上
you strap him to a skateboard,

然后顺着过道往瓶子上扔
you toss him down an alley at some pins.

-这想法不错  -绝对的
- No shit. That's interesting. - Swear to fucking God.

-这个我们也要吧  -没错我们俩都要
- Can we get that guy? - Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

但这上面说他兄弟同意露阴
But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.

-他倒是不长高  -他同意吗
- Instead of growing up. Yeah. - He will?

但他们挺易怒的
They are very ornery by the way,

所以跟这些小不点得悠着点
so you gotta be very careful with these little guys.

安全第一
Safety first.

安全第一  好吧
Safety is first, all right?

在旁边安排一个人拿着麻醉枪
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer gun

出事儿了就击晕他
ready to knock this fucker out.

-我们要不要弄个...-梅斯催泪  高压枪
- Do we want to get like a... - Mace. Taser guns.

小气枪怎么样
A pellet gun maybe?

不行  小气枪会伤到他的
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

我只想弄晕他  晕死就行
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

要我说我们还是认准法律漏洞
But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay?

要是我们不把他到人看
If we don't consider him a human,

就单纯的行为来讲  我们就没事
we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear.

就像飞天瓦伦达马戏团
Like The Flying Wallendas.

死了不少人也没人告他们
You know, a lot of those guys died but they never sued anybody.

重要的是你们得记住
The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind

他们互相会八卦的
is that these things gossip.

聚在一起就八卦
They get together and they gossip.

-这点好  -我们最不希望看到的
- That's a good point. - And the last thing

就是他们聚到一起然后说
that we need is them getting together and saying,

他们嘲笑我们了
"Oh, they made fun of us."

那会抹黑斯特拉顿的
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

我就爱你这点  能想到这些破事
That's why I love you. You think of shit like that.

等他们来了  就把他们当自己人  好吗
When they come in, we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

自己人  咕咕咕咕  自己人
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

接纳他们  自己人
We accept them, one of us!

咕咕咕咕  自己人
Gooble gobble, one of us.

接纳他们  自己人
We accept them, one of us.

咕咕咕咕  自己人
Gooble gobble, one of us!

乔丹  你爸来了
Jordan! Your Dad's coming.

好像是运通卡账单的事
Something about the American Express bill.

你能别让他来吗
Can you get him out of here?

能  你舔蛋去吧
Yeah. Lick my twat.

没  我认真的
No, I'm serious!

该死  各位  假装我们在工作
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

你他妈有股票单吗
You got any fucking stock forms?

他来了  他来了
He's coming, he's coming.

随便编点什么
Make some shit up.

我觉得要是我们把辉瑞制药...
I think if we short Pfizer...

一个月43万吗  乔丹
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

你他妈的一个月
Four hundred and fucking

居然他妈的花43万吗
30,000 fucking dollars in one fucking month!

早上好  那都是商务花费  淡定点
Good morning. They're business expenses. Relax.

-商务花费吗  -是
- Business expenses? - Yes.

-乔丹  你看你这都是什么  -什么
- Jordy, look what you got here. - What?

看这个  两万六美金一顿晚饭
Look at this. $26,000 for one fucking dinner!

不  这我能解释
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

爸  我们有客户的  辉瑞制药的客户
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

没错  阿根廷的上等腰肉牛排
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

还得买上等的香槟  都很贵的
Expensive champagne and... We had to buy champagne.

然后你还点了一堆狗屁配菜
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

-你自己跟他说  -我点了配菜  所以
- Tell him about the sides. - I ordered sides, so...

还配菜  26万块的配菜吗
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

你这配菜治癌症的吗
What are these sides? They cure cancer?

问题是配菜的确治癌症
The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem.

所以才这么贵
That's why they were expensive.

-你他妈闭嘴吧  -我认真的
- Shut the fuck up. - I'm serious.

-够了  -还有EJ娱乐
- Stop. - And EJ Entertainment?

EJ娱乐是他妈什么东西
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

这个是
Well, that's...

是啊  乔丹  EJ娱乐是什么
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

这怎么形容呢
How do I describe this?

乔丹  是什么
Jord, what is that?

-这他妈是卖淫团伙  乔丹  -我知道
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy! - I know.

-是卖淫团伙知道吗  -的确是卖淫团伙
- That's what it is! - That is what it is.

你看这么形容合适不
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

的确是这样  但这都不是我干的
That is what it is. But none of these were charged to me.

这都是他们干的
This is all of them.

-是吗  都是我们干的  -反正不是我
- Oh, that was all us? - It wasn't me though.

快他妈给他解释清楚
Fucking explain this shit to him!

这他妈都是你花的钱
These are all of your fucking charges right here!

联邦税务部允许旅行女乐花费的  没事
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

旅行娱乐
T&E!

那叫旅行娱乐
T&E!

是  我说的就是
Yeah. I said T&E.

-不是  你说的旅行女乐  -我没说
- No, no. You said T&A. - No, I didn't.

你说了
Yeah, you did.

-我什么时候说了  -你说的旅行女乐
- When did I say that? - You said T&A.

那叫旅行娱乐
T&E!

我知道你对那顿饭不满意
I know you're upset about the dinner,

你有道理生气
and that makes sense because

因为我们的确花太多了
we did spend too much money.

但我说的就是旅行娱乐
But I said T&E.

别跟我说你说了什么  我都听见了
Don't tell me what you said. I heard what you said.

-爸  他说的是旅行娱乐  -是吗
- Dad. He said T&A. - He did?

绝对的  毫无疑问
Absolutely, no question.

我是要...
I'm trying to...

我就差一点
I'm getting this close!

-爸  别急  -我就差这么一点
- Dad, relax. - I'm getting this close.

我就是这意思  我想让你敞开心扉  麦克斯
That's what I'm saying. I want you to open up more, Max.

你等着他哪天杀了你
He's gonna fucking kill you.

你干嘛憋着  你干嘛都憋着
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

麦克斯  你干嘛非都憋着
Max, why do you hold it in?

够了  你他妈给我滚出去
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

-别  别别  -滚蛋  出去
- No, no, no! - Asshole, get out of here.

嫖什么妓女还能刷信用卡
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

有钱的
A rich one.

斯特拉顿会雇三种妓女
At Stratton, there were three kinds of hookers.

蓝筹股  顶尖好手  当模特的料子
The Blue Chips, top of the line, model material.

得花300到400美金
They cost between $300 and $500

你要是不想带套就得多给小费
and you had to wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip,

当然我每次都给
which, of course, I always did.

然后就是纳斯达克股  漂亮但活一般
Then came the NASDAQs, who were pretty, not great.

大概200到300块钱
They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.

最后就是粉单股的渣子了
Finally, there were the Pink Sheets. Skanks.

大概不到100块
They cost about 100 or less.

要是你不戴套的话
If you didn't wear a condom,

第二天就得去打青霉素了
you'd have to get a penicillin shot the next day

还得祈祷自己的老二别烂了
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

倒不是说这种我们就不干了
Not that we didn't fuck them, too.

相信我  我们都干了
Believe me, we did.

我又腰椎间盘突出了
It's that slipped disc thing again.

我知道你怎么回事  净那啥了
I know what it is. You know, too much...

就跟EJ娱乐
...with EJ Entertainment.

爹
Pops.

家里怎么样
How are things at home?

不是很好
Well, not the best.

她就是有点...你懂吧
She just doesn't... You know what I'm saying?

好像气味啊
It's like the smell...

有种气味  吸引力什么的
There's a smell, there's an attraction thing.

过段时间就越来越淡了
After a while it kind of fades away a little bit.

本来就该越来越淡的
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

-本来就  -婚姻就这样  知道吗
- Supposed to? - That's marriage. You know...

我和你妈结婚很长时间了
Your mother and I, we've been married a long, long time.

你难道觉得我们俩
What do you think? We're...

每两分钟就得上个床吗
We're jumping into bed every two minutes?

-那可不行  -我很爱她
- It doesn't work that way. - I love her to death.

爸  我不想离婚  但是
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

现在世道太疯狂了
It's crazy out there.

有些个姑娘  你真该见识见识
Some of these girls... You should see them.

老天
Oh, my God!

简直是
They're fucking...

爹  她们现在的活儿
The things they're doing now, Pops.

绝对是更新换代了
I mean... I mean, it's on a whole other level.

突然之间  就一周
All of a sudden, one week,

所有人下边就都干净了
nobody had anything down there anymore.

新世界了
It's a new world.

从眉毛往下就没毛了
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

一根毛没有  想激光除过一样
Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

真是新世界了
Wow. A new world.

我真是生早了
I was born too... too early.

其实我从来不喜欢阴毛
I've never been a fan of the bush, to be honest.

-真的吗  -是
- Really? - Yeah.

无所谓
I don't mind it.

爸
Dad.

我不想让你为这些操心
I don't want you stressing out about any of this.

我怎么可能不操心
How can I not get stressed out?

看你都找些什么蠢货给你工作
Look at the knuckleheads you got working for you.

我知道他们是傻瓜
I know they're knuckleheads

但我得让他们羡慕我的生活  懂吗
but I need them to want to live like me, you get it?

想过得像我一样
To live like me.

乔丹
Jordy.

你这么折腾早晚遭报应
One of these days, the chickens are gonna come home to roost.

你觉得我疯了吗
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

疯了  你这叫伤风败俗
Crazy? This is obscene.

的确伤风败俗
It was obscene.

在现实世界中的确如此
In the normal world.

但谁愿意活在现实中
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

一起狂欢到屌炸天吧
Go party your fucking cocks off!

我们将成为华尔街的
We are about to become fucking legends

传奇
on Wall Street!

我们的规划将带领公司
We got plans up here that's gonna take this company

一路冲上平流层
into the fucking stratosphere!

狼仔  狼仔
Wolfie! Wolfie!

去他妈的梅林银行  管他呢
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

凭什么总让他们
Why should they be taking

赚走我们的钱
all our fucking money all the fucking time?

这样我们就是证券承销商了
This way we become the underwriters.

我们下一步棋
It was our next big move.

就是找公司帮他们做首次公开募股
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

这有这样  那些华尔街的小崽子们
It was the only way these Wall Street pricks

才能不把我们当做野鸡证券交易所
would ever stop thinking of us as some shitkicker bucket shop.

我们还有阿克利夫国际
We got Arncliffe International.

我们做事比较不寻常
See, we were a little different.

我们谈正事的时候
We liked to get as fucked up as possible

喜欢嗑药并喝得酩酊大醉
during our business powwows

这样才能才思泉涌
in order to stimulate our free-flowing ideas,

所以我们吃安眠酮就像吃巧克力豆一样
which is why we were popping these ludes like they were M&M's.

史蒂夫·麦登
Steve Madden.

那家公司归我们了
We own the fucking companies...

绝对归我们了
We own the companies...

不知道安眠酮是什么  我告诉你
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

等等  等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

貌似安眠酮
Looks like those ludes

正在唐尼身上显神迹呢
are working their magic on Donnie right now.

镇定安眠酮
The Quaalude,

一般叫作安眠酮
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

于1951年由一位印度医生首次合成
was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor,

是点红点的印度人  不是印第安人
 that's dots, not feathers,

当时被当做镇定催眠药开给
as a sedative, and was prescribed to

压力大的家庭妇女缓解睡眠障碍的
stressed-out housewives with sleep disorders.

但很快就有人发现
But pretty soon someone figured out

服药后只要忍住15分钟不睡
that if you resisted the urge to sleep for just 15 minutes,

就能爽翻天了
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

当然没过多久大家就开始滥用安眠酮了
Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, of course.

1982年美国和全世界都把安眠酮
And in 1982, the U.S. Government Schedule 1'd them.

列为了一级管控药物
Along with the rest of the world.

所以说安眠酮数量有限越吃越少
Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.

认真的  买都买不到
No shit, you can't even buy 'em anymore.

你们都惨了
You people are all shit out of luck.

你要说什么
What are you saying? What is it?

His friend from school, Steve Madden.

史蒂夫·麦登是当下炙手可热的女鞋品牌
Steve Madden was the name in women's shoes at the moment.

整条华尔街的人都想帮他上市
And all of Wall Street was begging to take his company public.

来啊  你要说什么
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

但你猜他跟谁是发小
Except, guess who grew up with him?

他说的全他妈是假话
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

我们从头开始
Let's start from the beginning.

我们从头开始好吧
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

你叫了一些朋友来对吧
You invited some friends over, right?

莫名其妙的局势就失控了
One thing led to another. Things got out of hand.

这我们可以理解
We understand that, we do.

我们也经常犯浑  生活堕落得一塌糊涂
We do blow all the time. We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

瞧瞧我们

但有人从我的公寓里偷了钱
But money was stolen from my apartment.

就从我放袜子的抽屉里
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

我说过了  我不知道您的钱在哪

就因为我是同性恋
This is a gay thing.

你们都
See, all of you...

我表弟也他妈的是基佬
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

我还跟他和他男友一起去度假呢
And I go on vacation with him and his boyfriend.

我喜欢基佬

You know, they got crazy.

just to keep them from killing the poor guy.

我给了他们每人1000块
I gave them each 1,000

告诉他们尼古拉斯做的好事

他以他的名义帮我持有股票

你是谁  犹太人版杰克·尼克劳斯吗
Who are you supposed to be, huh? Jack Nickle-Jew?

我把价格抬上去后
I'd drive the price up then

他把股票卖掉  然后把大部分利润还给
he'd sell and kick most of the profits back to...

没错  给我
You guessed it, me.

都是现金  都不在账上
All cash. None of it's on the books.

当然是违法的
A big no-no, of course, in the eyes of the law.

我们有了新的证券律师  曼尼·瑞丝金

再把股票卖回给我们的朋友  那些

好吧
Look.

我知道你压根不懂我在说什么
I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right?

没关系  无所谓
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

关键在于
The real question is this.

这合法吗
"Was all this legal?"

必须他妈的不合法
Absolutely fucking not.

但我们能赚到多得不知道怎么花的钱
But we were making more money than we knew what to do with.

在钱多得不知道怎么花的时候
And what do you do when you're making

你要怎么花呢
more money than you know what to do with?

我的天啊
Oh, my God!

你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

我在拉斯维加斯的

米拉奇办了单身派对
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.

从飞机上就开始纵酒狂欢了

上百名斯特拉顿人
A hundred Strattonites,

50个妓女
50 hookers,

落地了还有50个

当然也少不了毒品
Oh, and the drugs.

这个周末一共花了我两百万美金

包括翻修整个28楼的费用

内奥米是我的公爵夫人
With Naomi, my Duchess,

而我就是她帅气的公爵
me, her handsome Duke,

巴哈马海洋俱乐部  则是我们的城堡
and The Bahamas Ocean Club, our castle.

当然  在单身派对后  我这个公爵
Of course, after the bachelor party, me, the Duke,

得打点青霉素
needed a few penicillin shots so he could

才能安全地洞房
safely consummate the marriage.

我是巴瑞·克莱门  正在拍摄婚礼现场
Hey! Barry Kleinman, filming the wedding.

对你儿子说点什么吧
A few words for your son?

乔丹  牢记我的话
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

关于你的阴茎和她的阴道的

A fucking yacht?

游艇正在富翁中流行
For millionaires whose ships have come in,

豪华舒适的游艇才能带来顶级享受
pricey pleasure boats are for the most fun afloat.

150英尺长的绿色船体
It's no coincidence that its 150 feet of green hull

铺了百慕大草吗  乔丹
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

-全都被你毁了  -天啊  百慕大草
- and now you fucking wrecked it! - Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

你连看都不看
No, you didn't research the whole thing

也从来不和高尔夫球场的人打交道
and deal with the fucking golf course people!

天啊
Oh, my God,

你还得和球场的人打交道
you had to deal with the golf course people, too!

真是悲剧啊  亲爱的  天啊
What a Greek tragedy, honey! Oh, my God!

没错  早晨的惯例
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

起床先跟内奥米
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

就前一晚的什么傻事吵架
about whatever it is I did the night before.

然后蒸个桑拿
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

排掉留在身体里的毒品
the drugs still in my system.

然后评估一下损失

滴眼药水
Drown out my eyeballs.

吃点"背痛药"  开始这一天
Take my "Back pills" To get the day started,

然后想法儿跟内奥米和好
then seek to make up with Naomi.

早上好  爸比
Good morning, Daddy.

给人家的亲亲呢
Where's my kiss?

小甜心
Hey, sweetheart.

爸比可以跟两个甜心都亲亲吗
Does Daddy get a kiss from both of his little girls, huh?

不行
Oh, no.

爸比不能碰妈咪
No, Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy

很久很久
for a very, very,

都不能碰

爸比对刚才的话非常抱歉
Daddy's really sorry about what he said in the other room.

爸比不用浪费口舌
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

从现在起
And from now on,

妈咪在家只会穿

超短的小裙子了

遇到个天才
I caught a genius.

那就是史蒂夫·麦登
Enter Steve Madden.

伟大的美国鞋匠
The great American cobbler.

炙手可热的女鞋制造者
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

多亏了唐尼
And thanks to Donnie,

我们才能帮他的公司上市
we were taking his company public.

斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特爬出原始的泥泞
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out of the primordial ooze.

再也不是井底之蛙了
Pond scum no more.

所以得让他们见见你
That's why they gotta see your face.

你要鼓舞士气
You get them fired up so

大家才能拼命卖股票  好吗
they push the shit out of this stock. Okay?

不仅如此  唐尼和我
And not only that, Donnie and I secretly owned

秘密持有史蒂夫·麦登鞋业85%的股份
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

这是法律绝对不允许的
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

但我们打算着狠狠捞上一笔
but we'd get filthy fucking rich if our troops got behind it.

我们要鼓舞士气
Our job was to get them worked up.

但也不能太士气高涨了
But not too worked up.

不管你信不信
Believe it or not... Believe it or not though,

玛丽璐实际上和玛丽珍同款

因为他是个创作天才
It's because this man is a creative genius.

史蒂夫的能力和天赋
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

不是紧跟女鞋时尚潮流
it goes beyond just spotting the hottest shoe trends.

而是他  能引领潮流
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

懂吗
You understand?

史蒂夫这样的艺术家十年难遇
Artists like Steve come along once every decade.

就像乔治· 阿玛尼  詹尼·范思哲
I'm talking Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace,

可可·香奈儿
Coco Chanel,

伊夫圣罗兰
Yves Saint Laurent.

史蒂夫  过来一下
Steve, come over here for a second.

你们可能没有意识到
I don't think you all realize

史蒂夫·麦登
that Steve Madden

是女鞋界最炙手可热的人物
is the hottest person in the women's shoe industry,

北美的每一家百货商场
with orders going through the roof

他的订单都多到满天飞
at every department store in North America right now.

我们竟有幸邀请他来办公室
We have him here in our office!

谢天谢地  他来了
We should thank our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

我们应该五体投地
We should be on our hands and knees right now,

给他跪舔
getting ready to suck this guy off!

像这样  知道吗
Like this! Okay?

我要跪舔你的鸡鸡  史蒂夫
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

大家都想给你跪舔
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

这就是我们进入
This is our golden ticket

巧克力工厂的金奖券
to the fucking chocolate factory right here!

我要的是
And I wanna meet

威利·旺卡那样的魔法人物
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

要像奥柏伦柏人那样疯狂一次
I wanna be with the fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

好了  下去吧  下去
All right, get off this fucking stage! Get out of here.

大家都听好了
All right, I want all of you to focus for a second.

看到那些小黑盒子了吗
See those little black boxes?

那叫电话
They're called telephones.

告诉你们一个关于电话的小秘密
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about these telephones.

它们不会自己拨号  知道吗
They're not gonna dial themselves. Okay?

没有你们  它们只是快没用的塑料
Without you, they're just worthless hunks of plastic.

就像上膛的M16
Like a loaded M16

却没有扣动扳机的士兵
without a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

而这些电话存在的意义
And in the case of the telephone,

就取决于在座的各位
it's up to each and every one of you,

我训练有素的斯特拉顿人
my highly-trained Strattonites.

我的杀手们
My killers!

杀手们  不能接受否定的答案
My killers, who will not take no for an answer!

我的战士们
My fucking warriors,

决不轻易挂断电话
who will not hang up the phone

直到客户被拿下
until their client either buys

或者他妈死球
or fucking dies!

让我来告诉你们一件事
Let me tell you something.

没钱是装不了贵公子的
There is no nobility in poverty.

我可能成为一个富人
I have been a rich man

也可能成为一个穷人
and I have been a poor man.

我每次都他妈选择当富人
And I choose rich every fucking time.

因为作为一个富人
Because at least as a rich man,

当我要面对什么问题时
when I have to face my problems,

我起码可以坐在加长豪车后座出场
I show up in the back of a limo,

穿着一身两千美元的西服
wearing a $2,000 suit

带着四万美元他妈一块的金表
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

打一架  揍他
Duke it out! Hit him!

从我身上他妈滚下来
Get the fuck off me!

假如这儿有任何人觉得我肤浅或者物质
And if anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic,

那你去他妈的麦当劳找份工作吧
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

因为那里才是你他妈该去的地方
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

但在你离开这间满是胜者的房间之前
But before you depart this room full of winners,

我希望你能好好看看你身边的人  看吧
I want you to take a good look at the person next to you. Go on.

因为在不远的将来
Because sometime in the not-so-distant future,

你会开着一辆破破烂烂的福特斑马
you're gonna be pulling up to

在红灯前停下
a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

而那个人会开着一辆崭新的保时捷
and that person's gonna be pulling up right alongside you

停在你旁边
in their brand new Porsche

身旁还坐着他们漂亮的
with their beautiful wife by their side,

有一对大奶子的妻子
who's got big voluptuous tits.

而你身边会坐着谁呢
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

某头恶心的角马  满嘴唇毛
Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble,

穿着件无袖长袍
in a sleeveless muumuu,

挤进你身边
crammed in next to you

带着一满车从他妈折扣批发超市买的杂物
in a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

那就是将来坐在你身边的人
That's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

所以你们听我说  而且听仔细了
So you listen to me and you listen well.

你是不是还有信用卡账单没付清
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

你的房东是不是准备赶你出门了
Is your landlord ready to evict you?

很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

你女朋友是否觉得你他妈就是个屌丝
Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking worthless loser?

很好  拿起你们的电话然后开始拨号吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

我希望你们能赚够钱去解决这些问题
I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!

你们今天唯一需要做的就是拿起那台电话
All you have to do today is pick up that phone

然后说出我教你们说的话
and speak the words that I have taught you.

然后我就能让你们变得
And I will make you richer

比美利坚他妈合众国
than the most powerful

大部分有权有势的CEO都富有
CEO in the United States of fucking America!

好
Yeah!

他妈的棒极了
Fuck, yeah!

我希望你们上场
I want you to go out there

然后把史蒂夫·麦登的股票
and I want you to ram

塞进你客户的喉咙
Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats

直到他们噎住为止
until they fucking choke on it!

直到他们噎死而且买了十万股为止
Till they choke on it and they buy 100,000 shares!

那就是我想要的
That's what I want.

好  太他妈好了
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

你们要够凶残
You be ferocious!

-你们要够无情  -好
- You be relentless! - Yeah!

你们要当他妈的电话恐怖分子
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

现在  让我们把这操蛋的东西踢出去吧
Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!

下午一点
At 1:00 p.m.,

我们以每股四块五美元的价格开市
we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

到一点零三分  股价就超过了十八美元
By 1:03, it was over $18.

就连华尔街上的大投行也在买
Even the big Wall Street firms were buying.

出售的两百万股里面
Of the two million shares offered for sale,

有一百万是从我的老鼠仓帐户流出来的
a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

一旦价格到了高位
Now once the price hit the high teens...

你知道的  谁他妈在乎别的
You know what? Who gives a shit?

重点向来都是这个
As always, the point is this.

三小时就他妈两千两百万了
$22 million in three fucking hours!

你能相信吗
Can you believe this shit?

我他妈爱死这个了  宝贝儿
I fucking love this, baby!

这简直太棒了
It's amazing!

这是对我隐私的一种侵犯
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

你懂我在说什么吗  这就像...
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

这很具有侵略性  你懂
It's intrusive, you know.

他有你整个核心集团的照片
He's got pictures of your whole inner fucking circle.

照片  以及那些人的名字
Pictures, names of the people.

你知道他想干什么吗
You know what he's trying to do?

就是他正在干的事  看看你自己
Exactly what he's doing. Look at yourself.

他试图把你唠叨死
He's trying to rattle you,

他试图把你老婆唠叨死
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

然后她就会朝你叨叨个不停
so she nags you

直到你他妈出庭作证为止
until you become a fucking witness.

他想我自我检举揭发
He wants me to rat on myself?

他想我透露我自己的信息
He wants me to give information about my...

听着  他妈的好消息是
Listen. The good fucking news is,

你知道我认识市里的每个人
you know I know everybody downtown,

我可以打电话给司法部  给缉毒局
I call up the Justice Department, the DEA,

甚至不会有人知道你他妈的存在
nobody even knows you fucking exist,

所以说放松点
so calm down!

他们不知道我的存在
They don't know I exist?

-不知道  -那很好
- No. - That's good.

但你...
But you...

你知道他是谁  是吧
You know who he is, right?

-没错  -所以假如我想要问点消息
- Yeah. - So, if I just wanted to get some more information,

就看看他知道了多少东西
just find out what he knows,

你能去他家吧  是吗
you could go to his house, right?

窃听一下他的电话  安点窃听器
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

你能搞到点消息...
You could get some information...

你不能这样搞这些人
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

你不能这样搞他们
You don't fuck with them like that.

你怎么回事  是疯了还是怎样
What are you, nuts or something?

这就是你他妈要干的事情
This is what you fucking do.

不然我付钱给你是干什么的
What do I pay you for?

我是有他妈的侦探执照的  知道吗
I have a fucking P.I. License, you know?

我是靠这个吃饭的
I make a living at this.

我不再是一名警察了
I'm not a cop anymore.

他们会他妈的把我的执照夺走  明白吗
They'll take my fucking license away from me, all right?

好吧
Okay.

好吧  要是这样不行  能不能...
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

我能给这家伙打个电话吗
Can I give the guy a call?

-怎么了  这是  -乔丹  乔丹
- Why? Is that... - Jordan. Jordan.

行行好
Do me a favor?

唯一一个能给这家伙打电话的
The only one who calls this guy

就是你他妈的律师
is your fucking lawyer.

我不能打给他  是吧
I can't call him, right?

-这违反了规定吗  -我告诉你
- It's against the rules? - I told you,

不管你他妈对他说了什么
whatever the fuck you say to him,

他都会用来对付你  你难道不明白吗
he's gonna use against you. Don't you understand?

他很聪明  你很蠢
He's smart, you're dumb.

放他妈的屁
Fucking bullshit.

我们今晚是他妈的要好好谈谈
Are we fucking talking tonight,

还是你打算嗑到晕
or are you gonna get schwacked?

上次你嗑这些该死的药时
The last time you took these fucking pills,

你把你的头伸进了他妈的通心粉里
you put your head in the fucking macaroni.

得我去把你抬起来
I had to pick it up.

好吧
All right.

好吧  我不会打给他的
Okay, I won't call him.

伙计们  上船来  踏板就在那边
Hey, fellas! Come on board. The plank's right around there.

欢迎
Welcome!

真是美好的一天啊
What a nice day.

你好
Hey.

欢迎登船
Welcome aboard.

我是乔丹  欢迎登上内奥米号
Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi.

很高兴见到你
Pleasure to meet you.

德纳姆探员  这位是休斯探员
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

你好啊
Hi, how are you?

让我来给你们介绍一下  这位是尼克尔
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,

这位是海蒂  来吧  别害羞
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

你俩害羞个什么劲啊  别怕
What are you guys all shy for? Don't be scared.

她们是斯特拉顿的朋友
These are friends of Stratton.

-很高兴见到你们  -你好
- It's a pleasure. - Hello.

你信息上说你想单独谈谈
Your message said that you wanted to speak privately.

没错  我是想单独谈谈
Right. I do want to speak privately.

给我们点时间呗  女士们
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

要我帮你们拿什么东西尽管开口
Let me know if I can get you anything.

我们很乐意帮忙的
We'd be happy to help.

你们饿不饿
You guys hungry?

想吃点什么吗
Want something to eat?

这儿有意面  对虾  龙虾
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

我还有威士忌
I got whiskey.

你们想喝什么酒我这儿都有
Any kind of booze you want.

局里不允许我们"出海"的时候喝酒
You know what? The Bureau doesn't allow us to drink while we're at sea.

哈  当然啦
Duh! Of course.

你以前来过这种地方吗
Ever been on one of these before?

你指船上吗
A boat?

我六岁就学会开船了
I learned how to sail when I was six.

你没开玩笑吧  是吗  真的吗
No shit. Is that right? Really?

我的意思是像这样的
I mean on one like this, though?

我的意思是我把前面整个加长
I mean I had the whole front extended

专门用来停直升机
in order to fit the chopper up there.

看见那个了吗
See that?

不管怎样  这是给你的
Anyway, this is for you.

这是参加我婚礼的人的完整名单
It's a complete list of every person that was at my wedding.

我理解你想要整个婚礼录像
I understand you wanted the whole wedding video.

我猜这个能帮你加快进程  对吧
Figured this would help expedite the whole process, right?

-确实如此  -听着  我的重点是
- There you go. - Look, my point is that

我知道你在调查斯特拉顿
I know you're investigating Stratton.

但我想我一辈子也想不通是为什么
But for the life of me, I can't figure out why.

我知道我们是有点不正统
I know we're a little unorthodox,

我们做事有点大张旗鼓
we're a little loud in the way we do things.

但是你得理解
But you gotta understand,

我们是新入行的  你懂
we're the new guys on the block, you know,

我们在努力让自己名扬万里
we're trying to make a name for ourselves.

但我希望你明白  我们不做违法的事
But I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal.

无论如何也不做
Whatsoever.

你可以去找证监会的人
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

他们过去六个月来我办公室拜访了十五次
They were at my office 15 times over the last six months.

我是说  我没...我没什么要隐瞒的
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

你知道证监会只是个民事管理机构
Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency.

而我们查的是犯罪活动
We pursue criminal activities.

正是这样  你要查的是真正的犯罪
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

这让我很好奇你们为什么会调查我
which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for?

我是说  说实话...
I mean, honestly...

你觉得我们做过什么或者在做什么吗
what is it that you think that we did or do?

我不明白
I don't get it.

我...
Well, I...

乔丹  我不能讨论正在进行的调查
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.

没事  我明白  没事的  我理解
No, I get that. No, I understand.

虽然这么说
With that said...

其实这案子是被扔在我桌上的
this case got dumped on my desk...

-是这样吗  -你懂的  高层
- Did it? - You know, by a higher-up

那些想要作秀的人
who needs to make a show

得借着追查一家新公司为由
of looking into the new company on the block,

-拉上一堆媒体之类的  -新上位那些
- with all the press and everything. - New loud guys.

然后我就变成了来做调查的蠢货
And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking.

就是这样
Exactly.

只是  你懂的...这东西很烦
It's just, you know... it bothers me.

我们是新人
We're the new guy.

我们是去敲华尔街的门的人
We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door.

我的意思是  你应该...
I mean, you should...

你应该去查查那些大投行在干什么
You should see what's going on at the bigger firms.

我说  我知道所有的内幕
I mean, I know all the information.

是真的  高盛  雷曼兄弟  美林
It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

担保债务凭证
Collateralized debt obligations?

还有什么互联网概念股
This Internet stock bullshit?

简直就是他妈的放屁
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

我能手把手地告诉你
I could take you step-by-step

他们每一步都在做什么
through what exactly is occurring.

你只需要开口问
All you have to do is ask.

我随时恭候
I'm available.

我就等你这句话了
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

我不明白像这样的谈话
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

怎么就不能对我们双方都有利了
can't be profitable for the both of us.

本来就应该这样  是吧
It should. Right?

这本来就该对我们双方都有利
It should profit the both of us.

-是应该这样  -听着
- It should. - Look.

我会给你我的私人号码
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

工作日里随时可以打电话给我
Five days a week, you just call me, feel free.

-我会的  -棒极了
- I'll do that. - Great.

你们确定不喝点什么
Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?

你们不饿吗  什么也不要
You're not hungry? Nothing?

-什么都不要吗  不要吗  -不用了
- Nothing? No? - Oh, no.

让我问你几个问题
Let me ask you,

假如你不想透露太多个人信息
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

你可以随时叫我闭嘴
just tell me to shut up at any time.

你是不是曾经考虑过弄个经纪人执照
Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?

我不知道自己有没有听错
Did I hear that right?

你是不是也曾想来华尔街分一杯羹
Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

-没有吗  -你和谁谈过话
- No? - Who you been talking to?

你他妈和谁谈过了
Who the fuck you been talking to?

你在调查我  我也听了你的事迹
Well, you're investigating me. I hear things.

你懂我意思吧
You know what I mean?

你有没有想过假如你坚持下去了
You ever think about what would've happened

会发生什么
if you would have stayed the course?

你知道吗  每当我搭地铁回家
You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway

蛋蛋都他妈汗湿了
and my balls are fucking sweating,

一套西服连续穿了三天...
I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row...

没错  我当然想过
Yeah, you bet I do.

我以前就想过这个  谁不想呢  是吧
I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right?

没错  谁他妈会不想呢
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

你是怎么...
What do you get...

又是一个私人为题  你不用回答
Another personal question, no need to answer...

没事  没关系的  乔丹
No, that's all right, Jordan.

你能赚多少啊  五六万之类的
What do you pull in? 50, 60K? Something like that?

一年吗  大约
A year? In the ballpark?

我...
Well, I...

这样说吧
Let's put it this way.

局里至少能给你一把免费的枪
You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau.

这他妈让我很生气啊  你懂我意思吗
No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean?

你想想  那些建设了这个国家的人
You think about the people that built this country,

像你一样勤勤恳恳的人
hardworking people like you.

消防员  老师  联邦探员
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

结果到最后
End of the day,

你们这群人在经济上被生吞活剥了
you guys get fucking skinned alive financially.

这他妈让我太生气了
It fucking makes me angry.

如今  关于华尔街和这个市场
Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is,

在我看来  我觉得
for me, I feel

能回馈社会是好事  你知道  有些
it's good to give back. You know, there's...

有些情况下我能
There are situations where I can

让这些人处境好点  明白吗
make those situations better for people. You know?

你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

机遇
Opportunity

就是一切
is everything.

太对了
Exactly.

举个例子  有这么个小孩  是吧
Take for example, I got this one kid, right?

去学校学环境科学之类的
Went to school for environmental science, something like that.

但却被学生贷款困住了
He was bogged down by student loans.

然后他妈又要做三重心脏搭桥手术
Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery.

-天呐  -没错  很惨
- Jesus. - Right. Horrible situation.

是啊
Sure.

但是我们在正确的时候
But we got him into the market

拉他入市  再选一只正确的股票
at the right time and chose the right stock.

我们给予他正确的指导
We gave him the right guidance.

轰  一夜之间  就改变了他整个人生
Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life.

他妈被送进了纽约最好的医院
Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City.

但还是没用
It didn't work out for her,

假设  她还是去世了  很不幸
granted, she passed away, unfortunately.

但我们至少给了他那个机会
But we gave him that opportunity.

你懂我在说什么吗
You know what I'm saying?

这取决于建立一个好团队
It's just about setting up the right team,

然后一夜之间你的人生将得以改变
and then overnight your life can change.

一个实习生能...能...
What does... What does an intern...

一个实习生做这样一单能赚多少
What does an intern make in a deal like that?

在那种情况下
Well, in that situation,

在那笔特定的交易里  就那一笔
in that particular trade, and it was one trade,

五十多万美元吧
north of half a million dollars.

而且我会为任何人做这件事  明白吗
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

任何需要适当的指导的人
anybody that needs the proper guidance.

能再说一遍吗  就把刚刚说的再说一遍
Can you say that again, just the way you said it?

一模一样的
Just the same way.

我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

算了吧  你当然懂我在说什么
Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about.

我觉得刚刚乔丹在干的事是...
I think what Jordan just did is he...

-假如我没弄错的话...  -不是
- If I'm not mistaken... - No.

你刚刚在试图贿赂一个联邦官员
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

没有  理论上我没有贿赂任何人
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

不不  我听到的可不是这样的  乔丹
No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan.

不不  根据美国刑法
No, no, according to the U.S. criminal code,

贿赂必须有个
there needs to be an exact

确切的金额
dollar figure for the exchange of services.

那个在法庭上站不住脚的
That would not hold up in a court of law.

不不  我听见的可不是这么回事
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

不不不  事实就是如此
No, no, no, that's the truth.

但我想告诉你这个
But I want to tell you this.

你说
Yeah.

那个告诉我你曾经试过
The same gentleman that told me

考经纪人执照的人
that you tried to get your broker's license

也和我说过你是个规矩正直的人
also told me that you are a straight arrow.

他把我仔细调查了一番
He ran a security check on me.

这个嘛...
Well...

没错  假如你驾着一艘
Yeah, when you sail on a boat

像是邦德电影里反派开的船
fit for a Bond villain,

那有时你就得扮扮"恶人"   是吧
sometimes you need to play the part. Right?

我觉得你俩是时候滚下我的船了
I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat.

你说什么
What do you say?

你知道吗  乔丹  我告诉你一件事
You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something.

大部分我逮捕的华尔街混蛋
Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust,

他们都是天生如此
they're to the manor born.

-是吗  -没错
- Is that right? - Yeah.

他们老爹是混蛋
Their fathers are douchebags,

老爹的老爹也是
just like their fathers before them.

但你不一样
But you...

乔丹  你全是自己打拼出来的
You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own.

是吗
Did I?

-佩服佩服  小伙子  -小伙子
- Good for you, little man. - Little man?

真心佩服
Good for you.

你居然叫我小伙子
Me, the little man?

而且我跟你说
And let me tell you something.

我跟你说点别的
Let me tell you something else.

老实说  我没跟你开玩笑啊
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

这艘船可说是我登上过的
this is one of the nicest boats

-最好的船了  真心话  -我看也是
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you. - I bet it is.

你知道我还怎么想的吗
And you know what I was just thinking, too?

如果哪天局里派人封了这艘船
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office

那我他妈肯定就是大英雄
when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat.

你他妈说是不是这样  乔丹
Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

瞧瞧这艘船
look at this thing!

多漂亮
It's beautiful!

而且你船上还有美妞儿  多好
And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful.

挺好  快他妈给我滚
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

我想我们很快就会
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

-再见面的  -我同意
- real soon. - I'm sure.

祝你们坐破地铁
Good luck on that subway

回家干你们臭婆娘的路上一路顺风
ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

我则要让海蒂
I'm gonna have Heidi lick

就着鱼子酱舔我的蛋
some caviar off my balls in the meantime.

你两个想不想带些龙虾回家
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home?

一群混蛋  谅你们也吃不起
Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them!

一群贱货
Fucking cheap fucks.

混蛋
Fucking miserable pricks.

两位  看看我掏兜的时候找着了啥
Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look!

把你们一年的工资都掏出来了
A year's salary right here.

你知道我管这叫什么吗  优惠券
You know what I call them? Fun coupons!

看见了吗
See that!

我都嫌多的优惠券
They're fun coupons!

瑞士  瑞士有什么好逛的
Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?

当然是去逛瑞士银行
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

现在得遮遮丑  我必须得把钱藏起来
It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money.

因特·鲁格拉特
Enter Rugrat.

他是在法学院里认识这个瑞士银行家的
He knew this Swiss banker from law school.

这是干欧洲娘们用的
That's for European pussy!

但他人在日内瓦
But he was in Geneva.

所以这趟长途飞机  我肯定要嗨着过去
And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober.

我知道我只需适当的药量
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

就能睡完整个旅程
I could sleep through the entire flight.

但必须要按时按量
But I had to take them just right.

下午四点整  我又吃了几片
At 4:00 P.M., I popped a few more ludes,

这样等我开完销售会议
which started kicking in by the time

药劲正好上来
I finished my sales meeting.

这是手脚刺痒阶段
My tingle phase.

到晚餐时  我再吃几片
By dinner, I popped a few more

就着几杯鸡尾酒和一两片安定
on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two.

这是口齿不清阶段
My slur phase.

到八点半  我再多吃几片
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

这时我差不多就走不动道了
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

这是口水横流阶段
This was the drool phase.

到十点  我就完全不知道我是谁了
By 10:00, I didn't know who or what the fuck I was.

这是记忆丧失阶段
The amnesia phase.

我们在午夜之前登机
We boarded the plane just before midnight.

妈呀  瞧瞧
Wow! Look at you!

-好个美人儿  -请别这样  先生
- You're beautiful. - Excuse me, sir.

他安眠药的药劲上来了  他没事的
His sleeping pills just kicked in. He's all right.

能出示一下登机牌吗  先生
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

我们当然有登机牌
We have the boarding passes.

向老天发誓  我真想干她
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

干嘛呢  轻点
Hey! Fucking relax.

老天  快把你的爪子从我的老二上拿开
Oh, my God! You got your hand on my fucking cock!

别闹了
Cut it out.

你看他还到处乱摸
He's got his hand on my dick again.

我这是给你系安全带
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

你摸着他老二了吗
You got your hand on his dick?

大庭广众的可控制着点啊
You gotta stop doing that in public places.

我的天  放手
Oh, my God. Take it off!

快放手
Take it off!

我听说你头发里有藏宝图呢
I heard there's a treasure map under here.

-我这就去  别说了  -抱歉
- I'm going! Stop. - Okay, sorry.

我们抱歉  我们这就睡觉去
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

提问  我要求提问
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

Fasten your seat belt, sir.

您不系好安全带我们就
We cannot take off if you haven't fastened

We don't understand this language you're speaking.

我要帮他系上安全带
I will help him with his seat belt.

-你得让他坐正  -坐好  坐好先生

唐尼  这不好玩  快给我解开
Donnie, this isn't funny. You gotta untie me, buddy.

不行啊
I can't untie you.

机长绑的你  再不然他就要用电棍了
The captain tied you up. He almost fucking tasered you.

为什么
Why?

不怪你  亲爱的  别怪你自己
it's not you, sweetheart, don't beat yourself up.

别紧张  他没事  他只是怕坐飞机
Easy, easy. He's fine. He's just a nervous flyer.

你冲别人大喊大叫
You were screaming at people.

不是吧
Oh, fuck off.

你在地板上满地打滚
You were on the floor rolling around and shit.

我的天
Oh, Jesus.

你管机长叫什么奴
You called the captain the N-word.

我这么叫他了吗
I called the captain the N-word?

-他非常不高兴  -是吗
- Yeah, he was very upset. - Really?

-还好我们在头等舱  -我的天
- Luckily we're in first class. - Jesus.

我说你是不是嗑药上瘾了
Jesus Christ, I think you have a fucking drug problem.

药在哪  到底在哪
Where are the ludes? Where are the ludes?

我藏得好好的  别紧张
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

-都弄好了  -那就好

使点劲  哥们
Rub it harder, buddy.

你是好宝贝
You're all right.

贝尔福先生  你可以走了
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

真的吗
Really?

-跟你说  唐尼  -咋了
- Hey, Donnie. - Yeah?

等我们到了那边  你注意点你自己
When we get out there, try not to act like yourself.

到了日内瓦就别混犯浑了  可以吗
Okay? Let's make Geneva an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

你冲着我来干什么
What are you fucking coming at me for?

听着  你现在坐在加长豪车而不是
Hey, listen. The only reason you're sitting in this limo

瑞士监狱里必须感谢我朋友  懂吗
and not in a Swiss jail is because of my friend. Okay?

帮个忙
Hilfe!

-到了到了  -大家伙稳着点
- We're here. We're here. - Everyone calm down.

乔丹·贝尔福
Jordan Belfort!

您终于来了
At last.

我从尼古拉斯那听到了您的许多壮举
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

乔丹  这位是简·雅克·索雷尔
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

-很高兴认识您  -幸会幸会
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Nice to meet you.

您说笑了
It's a joke.

你只要坐一坐就知道是什么感觉了
You'll understand when you're in the fucking seat.

你需要大点的沙发  待客用的
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

哈哈  哈哈  我还是没懂  抱歉
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry.

我对你们国家的银行保密法很感兴趣
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws here.

等下  那个  抱歉乔丹
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

瑞士人待客总是得先来十分钟
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

这个那个的
Blah, blah, blah.

-闲聊  -对就是闲聊  多谢
- Chit chat. - Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

然后再谈正事
...before business can be discussed.

是吧
Yeah.

那好
Of course.

那咱们就说正事  您想了解些什么
Let's get down to it. What would you like to know?

在什么情况下  你们有义务
Under what circumstances would you be obligated

和联邦调查局
to cooperate with an FBI

或者美国司法部之类的部门合作
or a U.S. Justice Department investigation, for example?

看情况
Ca depend.

还得看情况
Ca depend?

没错
Oui.

具体看什么情况
Ca depend on what, exactly?

看美国人接下来几个月会不会
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland

占领瑞士
in the coming months.

要不要我去看看十字架上有没有跑坦克
Shall I check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

-那是十字街  -对对  十字街
- Yes. Rue de la Croix. - Croix. Croix.

是街不是架  还"十字架"  是街啦
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

我们在法学院常玩这个来着  不信你看
See, this is what he used to do back in law school. Check me.

-是香槟还是香崩  -没错
- Champagne. Champagne. - Yeah.

没错  还有炸薯条和炸洋芋
Yeah, yeah. French fries, pommes frites.

-总之这类的  -逗出鸟来了
- And that kind of stuff. - That's funny.

我问的是  你这瑞士废柴
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,

你会不会事后坑我
is are you going to fuck me over?

我当然听明白了  你个美国白痴
I understand perfectly, you American shit.

外国司法部门能够获得
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve

日内瓦银行合作的唯一情况
would cooperate with a foreign legal body

就是他们指控的罪名在瑞士也同样违法
is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.

但只有很少的瑞士法律涉及您从事的业务
But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices.

从金融角度讲
From a financial standpoint,

您现在身处天堂了
you are now in heaven.

我就说他很厉害吧
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

如果美国司法部
If the U.S. Justice

发传票给我们  我们会只当它
Department sent us a subpoena, it would become

是厕纸
papier toilette.

擦屁股用的
We would wipe our ass with it.

当然  除非他们是要调查
Unless, of course, it was an investigation

股票诈骗
into stock fraud,

我没记错的话  这在你们瑞士也是犯罪
which is a crime here in Switzerland, if I'm correct.

这样的话你们将有义务与他们合作
Then there would have to be cooperation on your part,

-如果我没说错的话  -当然
- if I'm not mistaken. - Yes.

当然会合作
Yes, we would.

如果账户是在你名下的话
Assuming the account is under your name.

但如果不是你的名字
If it were another name,

是你的朋友  令亲之类的
a friend's, camarade...

表亲吗
Cousin?

表亲  肯定也行
Cousin, absolute.

-你是说亲戚  -没错
- Relative? - Yeah.

你刚才那是哼小调
Was that yodeling I just heard

还是我所理解的那个意思
or did you just say what I thought you said?

就是那个意思
Yes. Yes.

他这是在建议我建个老鼠仓
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

但一只美国老鼠绝对没法
But a U.S. rathole would never get

把那么多钱弄到瑞士来
into Switzerland with all that money.

我还得找个有欧洲护照的老鼠
What I needed was a rathole with a European passport.

乔丹
Jordan.

你好啊  我最亲爱的姨妈
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

欢迎  路上没堵车吧
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

没有  当然没有
Oh, no, not at all.

乔丹  快进来
Jordan, come in.

还好说服艾玛姨妈没费多少劲
Thank God Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing.

看来英国人跟瑞士人差别也没那么大嘛
Turned out the British weren't too different from the Swiss.

只要钱跟上  一切就迎刃而解了
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

英式英语里"老鼠仓"怎么说
How do you say "Rathole" In British?

一旦你碰上任何麻烦
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

我就会马上站出来  承认是我骗了你
I'll come forth immediately. I'll say that I duped you.

我保证
That I promise.

冒险尤其能让人倍感青春  是吧亲爱的
Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it, darling?

有时我禁不住想
Sometimes I wonder

你是不是让钱给拿住了  亲爱的
if you let money get the best of you, my love.

以致忽视了其他种种
Among other substances.

这么明显啊
It's that obvious, huh?

天气一点都不热  但你却直冒汗
It's chilly, darling, and you're sweating bullets.

我该怎么说呢
What can I say? I'm...

我是个瘾君子
I'm a drug addict.

瘾头非常大
I really am.

白粉  摇头丸
Cocaine, pills,

这个那个  我都嗑
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

这是实情
Now that's the truth.

我是说
I mean...

我还有性瘾
I'm a sex addict, too.

这世上肯定还有比性瘾更危险的事
Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.

天啊  我跟你说这些干什么  我干嘛
Jesus, why am I telling you all this? Why am I...

真抱歉
I'm sorry.

因为我是个很好说话的人
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

还真是  你的确很好说话
You are. You are easy to talk to.

在我看来
I suppose it's...

这是我的责任
Just my job, you know.

有这么多人依仗着我
All these people dependent on me.

事关数以千万计的美金  你懂的
Tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know.

但有时我又觉得
Sometimes I feel like I...

我有点贪多嚼不烂了
I've bitten off more than I can chew, you know.

但你的胃口很大
You're a man with large appetites.

是啊
Yeah.

这姐们是在挑逗我吗
Is she fucking hitting on me?

是啊
Yeah.

还真是这样
Yeah, I am.

看来是我自作自受了哈
I suppose I put that on myself though, right?

我自己的决定
My decision.

有时候很难
It's just hard to...

很难控制内心的焦虑  你懂吗
Hard to learn to control the anxiety sometimes, you know?

就是那个
You know, to...

试着放松  放下心事
learn to relax and let go and...

去释放压力吗
to release the tension.

她还真在挑逗我
She is hitting on me.

我的天啊
Holy shit!

没错  释放压力
Yeah, to release the tension.

看来我们都得
I suppose we...

都得试着做到
We all just need to learn...

顺其自然  对吧
learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know?

这哥们他妈是不是在挑逗我
Is he fucking hitting on me?

稳住  亲爱的
Stability, dear.

我们是亲戚
Family.

你照顾好我的侄女  亲爱的
You take care of my niece, my love.

这边放心交给我
I'll take care of everything over here.

成交
Deal.

爽  真他妈爽
Come on! There you go.

我们货真价实地干了千金一炮
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

艾玛自己可运不了这么多钱
Aunt Emma could never carry all this by herself.

我就琢磨  还有谁有欧洲护照
So I thought to myself, who else has a European passport?

布拉德  你捆得太紧了
Brad, you're making this too fucking tight!

而布拉德作为一个成功的药贩子
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

每年冬天都要在法国南部度假
spent his winters in the south of France,

在那里他遇见了他的妻子  仙黛尔
which is where he met his wife, Chantalle,

她本是斯洛文尼亚的脱衣舞女
a stripper of Slovenian origin

正好就出生在
born, in of all places,

瑞士
Switzerland.

这根本就成不了
Well, this is fucked.

成了才怪
No shit.

她怎么着得跑50趟吧
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

我知道
I know.

不如这么着吧
Let me ask you something?

她不是还有家人吗
What about her family? Right?

他们人人都有瑞士护照
I mean, they all got Swiss passports, right.

她有父母  有兄弟  是不是
She's got parents, she's got a brother, right?

他兄弟还有个老婆  这就是五个人了
The brother's got a wife. That's five fucking people.

顶多六七趟  是吧
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

他们跟她一样都是瑞士的蠢货
They're all fucking Swiss nitwits like her.

-他们会同意的  -没准能行
- They'll do it. - We could do that.

至少我还有家人  你个大鼻子蠢货
At least I have a family, you crooked-nose fuck!

别忘了我的钱
Hey, don't forget about my money.

抱歉你说啥
I'm sorry, what's that?

我忘了提了  他也有
Yeah, I forgot to tell you. He's got some...

-也有些钱要运  -我的钱
- He's got some money. - My money.

我一周之内要进个几百万的
I got a couple of mil coming in like a week.

钱进账 我给你电话  你来取
When it gets in, I'll give you a call, you come pick it up.

你还给我打电话
You give me a call?

等钱来了
When it gets here,

我给你打电话  你来取
I'll give you a call and you'll come pick it up.

我们又不给你干活  老兄
Well, we don't fucking work for you, man!

亲爱的  你奶子上贴的全是我们的钱
Sweetheart, you have my money taped to your tits.

明白吗  说白了  你就是给我干活的
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

乔丹  我得跟你谈谈
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

我他妈不干这个  我跟你明说了吧
If I fucking do this, I'm telling you right now,

我才不会去找他
I ain't going to him, okay.

-我又不是给他跑腿的  -我懂
- I'm not a fucking shvartze. - I got it.

我不干上门取件的事  明白吗
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

-我明白  -你听好了
- I got it. - Well, listen to me.

我说在哪碰头就在哪
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

然后你告诉那个死胖子
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

-过时不候  -我会说的
- he comes correct. - I will.

他敢闯一丁点乱子  我发誓
He comes in all fucking loopy and fucked up, I swear to God

我把丫的牙打回牙床子里去
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

你他妈要打谁的牙床子
You're gonna mash whose fucking teeth in?

咱俩玩玩看谁打谁的牙床子
Whose fucking teeth are you gonna mash in?

你那破桌子上堆的是我的钱  不是你的
I put the money on that fucking table! Not you!

要不是老子  你他妈能有今天
I'm the reason we have this whole fucking deal!

-他有枪  白痴  -操他妈的枪
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot! - Fuck his gun!

那堆钱是我的
I put that money in there!

你他妈逼就是个药贩子
You know what? You're a fucking pill dealer.

像你这种人我一捞一大把
I got five more just like you, bro.

继续说啊  你他妈的狗杂种
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

你他妈逼穿得也像坨屎
You know what else? You dress like shit!

操死你丫的
So fuck you!

- Fucking motherfucker! - Oh! Jesus!

爽不爽  你个操屁眼的  看谁是基佬
How about that, faggot? Who's a faggot?

你还好吧  兄弟
You okay? Hey, pal.

第二天  艾玛姑妈飞去了日内瓦
The next day, Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.

带了两百万美元现金
Two million in cash in her carry-on,

对瑞士那边来说可是九牛一毛

-我一单生意就几百万  -没错
- I make million-dollar deals. - That right.

With smart important people, unlike you.

他们不会因为怕了就动手打人  明白吗
People who don't sucker-punch people when they're scared. Okay?

-你是说我怕了  -顺便还有
- I'm scared, huh? - And by the way,

你还没给我一个道歉呢

柠檬714就是安眠药中的战斗机
When it comes to Quaaludes, the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

我以为这只是一个神话

看看这些宝贝
Look at these babies.

唐尼真是懂得怎么庆祝啊
Boy, Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

他说这个要留在特别时机再用
He said he was saving these for a special occasion.

比如过生日  击掌庆祝时

于是当晚
So that night,

我撇开所有计划并清除我体内

都35分钟了
It's been 35 minutes.

可能我们磕了这么多年有耐药性了
Maybe we've built up a tolerance after all these years, huh?

屁用没有
This is bullshit!

我的新陈代谢飞速运转  啥感觉也没有
My metabolism's pumping. I can't feel shit!

时间太长了

我直接跳过了刺痛状态
I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase

进入了流口水状态

告诉我你在哪  别他妈开...
Tell me where you are! Don't fucking drive...

这些小东西药性太猛了
These little bastards were so strong,

我发掘了一种全新的感受

奇迹般地  我活着回到了家
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

我和车都没有蹭到
not a scratch on me or the car.

乔丹

贝尔福先生
Mr. Belfort?

整晚都坐在这儿
I been sitting here all night.

你们他妈什么意思
What the fuck are you talking about?

-你们带他去哪儿  -你们带我去哪儿
- Where you taking him? - Where you taking me?

你们带他去哪儿
Where you taking him?

你们又没有搜查证
You ain't got no warrant.

怎么能随便到别人家里来
Just come up in people's house like that!

你今晚开过你的车吗  贝尔福先生
Did you drive your car tonight, Mr. Belfort?

怎么说呢
Well?

看来我并没有安然无恙地到家
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

快他妈让开
Get out of the fucking way!

我擦
Fuck!

你今晚开过这辆车吗
Did you drive that car tonight?

-有  -好的
- Yeah. - Yeah, right.

我可是有家室的
I'm a family man!

有家室的  亲爱的
Family man. Honey!

我没把自己撞死
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

或者撞死别人真是个奇迹
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

警察带我去问了话  但他们没法起诉我
The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me.

他们没法证明我开了车
They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.

与此同时
Meanwhile,

布拉德因为蔑视法庭坐了三个月牢
Brad did three months in jail for contempt,

因为他不肯供出唐尼
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

结果就是  我安然无恙
The result, I was scot-free.

但我也受到了前所未有的监视
But I had eyes on me like never before.

你真是走运  乔丹
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

居然能活着  还不用坐牢
You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail.

你知道我不相信运气的  对吧
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

但是是时候了
But it's time.

拜托让我跟证监会谈好条件
Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal

在你运气用光以前
before your luck runs out.

跟爸爸挥挥手
Wave to Daddy.

嗨
Hey.

你好啊  甜心
Hey, sweetie.

都有什么条件  如果我...
What kind of terms would you be talking about if I...

这很难说
I don't know.

你得坦白一些违反证券规则
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations,

操纵股价  高压销售
stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics.

都是这样的小罪  你懂的
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

你得付几百万的罚款
You pay a couple million dollars in fines,

作为交换  证监会永远不会再烦你
in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time.

那斯特拉顿呢
And Stratton?

斯特拉顿会怎么样
What happens to Stratton?

没别的办法...你必须收手  对吧
There's no way... I mean... You got to walk away. Right?

让唐尼管事就行
Let Donnie be in charge.

没错  唐尼
Right. Donnie.

FBI可没那么好对付
Now the FBI is another animal completely.

他们会继续追查你的犯罪行为
They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing.

不过  只要你自愿离职
However, with you stepping down voluntarily,

我猜你的好朋友德纳姆探员
my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham

也就无计可施了
will be standing around with his dick in his hand.

乔丹
Jordan.

你还有什么好考虑的
What do you have to think about?

你打败了他们
You beat them.

你赢了
You won!

你一辈子都不用工作了
God knows you never have to work again.

你还想怎么样  在牢里度过余生吗
What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?

-你想那样吗  -不想
- Is that what you want? - No.

-当然不想  -那不就得了
- Of course not. - Okay.

你已经挣了全世界的财富
Okay! You got all the money in the world.

难道还想把所有人的钱都挣光吗
You need everybody else's money?

-当然不是  爸  -所以啊
- Of course not, Pops. - Well?

-可这是我一手创造的  -这我知道
- You know, I built it. - I know you built it.

你创造了这些  现在你得保住它们
You built it, so now preserve it.

你知道
You know,

五年前  当我和唐尼·亚速一起创立
five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont

斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特的时候  我就知道
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

总有一天我要离开这里
would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on.

现在我非常沉重地宣布...
And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that...

那一天终于来了
That that day is finally here.

我想...我想谢谢你们所有人
I wanna... I want to thank you all for your...

谢谢你们多年的忠诚与敬仰
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

但重点是
But the point is this.

在唐尼的领导下
Under Donnie's leadership,

再加上尼基·克斯考夫和罗比·范伯格
along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg

加入领导层
moving into key management positions,

这里只会比原来更好
this place really, is gonna be better than ever!

我保证  好吗
That I promise you. Okay?

为他们鼓掌吧  来吧
Give them a round of applause. Come on.

这里就是埃利斯岛  各位
This is Ellis Island here, people.

我不管你是谁  从哪里来
I don't care who you are, where you're from,

不管你的祖先是坐他妈的五月花号
whether your relatives came over on the fucking Mayflower

还是从海蒂坐轮胎漂过来的
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

这里就是你的希望之地
this right here is the land of opportunity.

斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特就是美利坚
Stratton Oakmont is America!

你们都认识几米·贝尔泽吧
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

是的
Yes, we do.

去你的
Fuck you.

别这样  几米
Come on, Kimmie.

你们可能不知道的是
What you probably didn't know is,

几米是这里最早的经纪人之一
Kimmie was one of the first brokers here,

斯特拉顿最初的二十名员工之一
one of Stratton's original 20.

你们大部分人认识的几米
Now most of you met Kimmie,

是现在这个美丽优雅的女性
the beautiful sophisticated woman that she is today.

穿着三千块的阿玛尼套装
A woman that wears $3,000 Armani suits.

开着崭新的奔驰
Who drives a brand-new Mercedes-Benz.

冬天在巴哈马度假
A woman who spends her winters in the Bahamas,

夏天在汉普顿避暑
and summers in the Hamptons!

我遇到的几米可不是这样的
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

我遇到的几米身无分文
The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together.

她是个穷困潦倒的单亲母亲
She was a single mom on the balls of her ass

有个八岁的儿子
with an eight-year-old son.

她已经欠了三个月的房租
Okay? She was three months behind on her rent.

她来我这儿找工作的时候
And when she came to me and asked me for a job,

只想要五千块的预付工资
she asked for a $5,000 advance,

来付她儿子的学费
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

我是怎么做的  几米
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

告诉他们
Go on, tell them.

你给我写了一张
You wrote me a check

两万五千块的支票
for $25,000.

没错
That's right.

谢谢你
Thank you.

你知道我为什么这么做吗
And you know why that is?

因为我相信你
It's because I believed in you.

因为我相信你  几米
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

就像我相信今天在场的每一位
just like I believe in each and every one of you here today.

-我他妈爱你  乔丹  -我他妈爱你
- I fucking love you, Jordan! - I fucking love you.

我他妈爱你  我爱你
I fucking love you! I love you.

我他妈也爱你 我他妈也爱你

我爱你们所有人
And I love all of you!

我从心底爱你们所有人
And I love all of you from the bottom of my heart.

-我他妈也爱你  -真心的
- I fucking love you, too. - I mean that.

你最屌  你他妈最屌了
You are the shit. You are the fucking shit.

真是讽刺啊
It's a shame, you know.

这么多年来  我一直告诉你们
For years, I've been telling

不要接受别人的拒绝  对吧
you guys never to take no for an answer, right?

继续努力  不要挂下电话
You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone

知道你得到你想要的
until you get what you want.

因为那是你应得的
Because you all deserve it.

而我就要签的那个混蛋协议
You know, this fucking deal that I'm about to sign,

禁止我参与证券行业
barring me from the securities industry,

禁止我进入斯特拉顿
barring me from Stratton,

我的家
my home.

这他妈算什么啊
What the fuck is that, you know?

我来告诉你它是什么  它是...
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

是我接受别人的拒绝
It's me taking no for an answer, you know.

是他们...
It's them...

他们说服了我  而不是反过来
It's them selling me, not the other way around.

是我变成了伪君子
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

所以...
So...

你猜怎么着
You know what?

我不走了
I'm not leaving.

我他妈不走了
I'm not fucking leaving!

你他妈升不了职啦
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

演出继续
The show goes on!

这是我的家
This is my home!

他们得拆了这地方
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball

才能把我弄走
to take me out of here!

让他们派国民警卫队来吧
They're gonna need to send in the National Guard

或者他妈的特警队
or fucking SWAT team,

因为我哪儿也不去
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

去他们的
Fuck them!

乔迪  乔迪
Jordy! Jordy!

乔迪  回来
Jordy! Get back here!

喂
Hey!

Give me that.

这算什么
What is this?

丛林大狂欢吗  上帝啊
Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?

帕迪  你走运了  爱尔兰小子
Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.

乔丹·贝尔福撕毁了和证监会的协议
Jordan Belfort just welched on his deal with the SEC.

可以继续追查他了  狩猎愉快
He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.

我们开始了盛大的狂欢
It was our time to party big.

正好布拉德也出狱了
And just as Brad was released from jail, too.

我道歉  赔他入狱期间的损失
I apologized, even offered to pay him for his time in the can.

但他拒绝了  说他不干了
But he said no, that he was out.

他不想再跟我们有瓜葛
He didn't want any part of us.

可惜的是
Sad thing was,

两年后他就死了
two years later he was dead.

死于心脏病  才35岁
Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.

和莫扎特去世的年龄一样
Same age Mozart died.

他们倒也没什么共同点  不过...
Not that they have a hell of a lot in common, but...

算了  我也不知道怎么会想到这些的
Anyway, I don't know why that came to mind.

没过几天  传票就开始满天飞
Within days, subpoenas started flying.

要求出示文件  做口供  应有尽有
Notices to produce documents, depositions, you name it.

唐尼都给弄得缺水了
Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.

美国政府要给我们传票
United States government wants to give me a subpoena?

咱们斯特拉顿·奥克蒙特就这么对付传票
Here's what we do with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

操你妈的美国  操你妈
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

操你妈  操你妈
Fuck you! Fuck you!

操你妈

Are you gonna finish the rest of that Danish?

-我能吃点心吗  -当然  吃吧
- Can I have that Danish? - No, no, go ahead.

他们审问了所有人
They interrogated everybody.

我血压低  甲状腺的问题
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

审问持续了几个月
It went on for months.

简直是在骚扰我们
It was a total fucking harassment.

让他问问题吧
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

但没有一个斯特拉顿人崩溃
But not a single Strattonite cracked.

格拉迪斯·卡雷拉呢

你给佛朗西斯·索特吉打了很多通电话
Francis Sortigi you called so many times,

我觉得你应该记得
I just thought you might remember that.

你记得这些吗
Would you remember any of those?

-我不记得  -这个阿杜卜勒...

那通电话打了很久
It was a long phone call.

我想知道你还有没有印象
I just wondered if you have any memory of that.

好了  我们已经
Okay. You know we've talked

跟这里的好几名员工谈过了
to several of the employees at this firm,

没人记得史蒂夫·麦登首次公开募股的事
and nobody can recall anything about this Steve Madden IPO.

我觉得挺奇怪的
I think it's odd.

你记得运输公司吗
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

你记得吗
You do recall it?

不  我完全不记得
No, I don't recall that at all.

抱歉  我想问你的头发是真的吗
Excuse me. I have to ask. Is that your real hair?

必须每15分钟喝一杯  拜托了
which requires me to drink one of those every 15 minutes, please.

我们被明确告知不能出国
We were specifically advised not to leave the country.

所以我们带着老婆去了意大利

我们觉得在海外办公会更安全
We figured we were safer working from overseas

只要给鲁格拉特下命令就好
giving orders to Rugrat.

没人能逮捕我们  也没人能证明
Nobody could arrest us and nobody could prove

我在游艇上操控着斯特拉顿
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

嘿  鲁格拉特
Hey, Rugrat.

你好啊
Bonjour.

你这秃头鹰  还好吗
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

唐尼  唐尼  听着
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

我们有麻烦了
We have a problem, okay.

你的朋友史蒂夫·麦登正在抛售股份
Your friend, Steve Madden, is unloading shares.

你说什么呢  谁告诉你的
What are you saying? Who told you that?

-怎么了  -是真的  唐尼
- What's going on? - He's doing it, Donnie!

他说史蒂夫·麦登在抛售股份
He said that Steve Madden's unloading shares.

谁跟你说的  真是胡扯
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

快把电话给我
Give me that goddamn phone.

-怎么了  -别听他的...
- What's going on? - Don't listen...

乔丹  听着  我正盯着屏幕呢
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

有大量的史蒂夫·麦登股票被抛售
and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold, okay.

不是我们卖的  所以只能是史蒂夫
It's not coming from us, so it's gotta be Steve.

只有他有那么多股份

尽管我掌握了百分之八十五的
Even though I owned 85%

史蒂夫·操蛋·混球·麦登鞋业的股份
of Steve-cocksucking- motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

但股权都是在他名下的
the shares were in his fucking name.

这混蛋知道调查局在找我麻烦
This motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the feds

想要趁火打劫
and was trying to take advantage.

说话啊  你准备怎么办
Talk to me, man. How do you wanna play this?

我要你现在就打给所有的客户
I want you to get all our clients on the phone right now,

让他们开始卖史蒂夫·麦登的股票
and have them start selling Steve Madden.

我们得把他妈的股价降下来
We're gonna drive that fucking price down!

我们就把他的公司弄成低价股  懂了吗
we'll turn his company into a penny stock! You hear me?

在了解情况之前
Let's just not jump to

Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

去你妹的心脏病
Fucking heart attack!

砰  啪  嗝屁

从此远离尘世
Shuffled off her mortal coil.

我的两千万困在瑞士的银行账户里了
And $20 million stuck in a Swiss bank account.

上次见到她  她还好好的呢
The last time I talked to her she was fine!

Does it go into probate or what?

这个你不需要担心  乔丹
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

你姑姑在死之前
Your aunt, before she died,

签了份文件  任命你为继承人
signed a document naming you as her successor.

真的吗
She did?

太好了  这是个好消息
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

这个嘛  暂时还不是
Well, not as of yet.

什么叫做暂时还不是
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

我听不清你说什么
I can't seem to hear you.

这里的信号太差了  你在说英文吗
I must have bad reception. Are you speaking English?

-快  现在  快动身  -快
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast. - Fast?

我要现在就动身去瑞士吗
I have to get to Switzerland now?

说英语  给老子说英语
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

安静点  让我讲完
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

带上西装  带上小鸡鸡  给我滚过来
Take your suit, take your dick, okay, and move your ass! Please.

等我们去到伦敦  她依然是死的
She'll still be dead by the time we get to London, okay?

泰德船长  听好了
Captain Ted! Captain Ted, all right, look.

我们现在改去摩纳哥  知道吗

Take care of business here, we'll drive back to Monaco,

坐飞机到伦敦  参加葬礼

三个办事日后回到纽约
and be in New York in three fucking business days!

这就是计划
That's the fucking plan.

我们可能会遇到海上风暴
I just want you to know that we might run into some chop.

小小的风暴  我们能搞定的吧
Chop? We can fucking handle chop, right?

我们的游艇足足有170英尺长
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

不不不  我们哪儿也不去
No, no, no. We're not going

除非他说安全
anywhere unless he says it's safe, all right.

-别担心风暴  -那很安全
- Don't worry about the chop. - It's safe.

你压根就不懂什么是风暴
You don't know shit about chop.

就你懂  你什么时候成风暴专家了
Oh, really? And you do? You're a fucking expert on that.

要不我把你的信用卡额度减半  怎么样
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half. How about that?

小小的风暴没事的  相信我
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

不用担心风暴  对吧泰德船长
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

如果我们开慢点的话  就不用怕了
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

我们把舱口封了  确保夹板安全
We'll batten down the hatches and secure the deck.

可能会打碎几个碟子
And we're looking at a few... maybe a few broken dishes.

就打碎几个碟子
Few broken dishes.

打碎几个碟子是什么概念
What's a few broken dishes?

听起来很安全嘛  不会有事的
Does that sound fucking awesome or what?

才不是
No. Not really.

我们一定会玩得很开心的
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

让我们现在就出发去摩纳哥
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

赶紧动起来  起程吧
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

稳住

What the fuck is going on out here?

摩托艇翻倒在甲板上了
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

我的天啊  宝贝  你还好吗
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

大风警报  大风警报
Gale warning! Gale warning!

海浪已升至20英尺高  并持续上升
The waves are 20 feet high and building!

掉头吧  我们走别的路线
Turn around, let's go the other fucking way.

-不行  -掉头
- We can't! - Go!

现在掉头的话  会翻船的
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

What are you saying?

该死的
Fuck!

去把安眠酮拿来
Get the ludes!

我下不去  下面被淹了  乔丹

天啊

抓稳了
Hold on!

离窗户远点
Get away from the window!

大浪要打过来了
Rogue wave!

求救
Mayday!

我是内奥米号的船长泰德·比切姆
This is Captain Ted Beecham aboard the yacht Naomi!

-我们要沉了  -我拿到了
- We are going down! - I got 'em!

我拿到了
I got 'em!

给我一颗  缓解下情绪
Give me one for the nerves!

我们要沉了
We're going down!

求救  求救
This is a fucking Mayday!

我们要求立即救援
We require immediate assistance!

抓紧了
Hold on!

小心
Watch out!

被意大利人救起来的好处就是
The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians

他们会喂饱你  给你喝红酒
is that they feed you, make you drink red wine,

最后还会跟你跳舞
then you get to dance.

你看到了吗
Did you see that?

那架飞机是我叫来接我们的
That was the plane I sent to come get us.

你一定想不到  一只海鸥撞上了机翼
I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine.

飞机在空中爆炸  死了三个人
Three people killed.

你希望上帝给你指引吗
You want a sign from God?

这次之后  我终于得到了指引
Well, after all this, I finally got the message.

你梦想过财政独立
Do you dream of becoming financially independent

却每个月都有还不完的债吗
but struggle every month just to pay your bills?

你想要拥有这样一栋房子
Would you like to own a home like this,

却只能勉强付得起房租吗
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

我是乔丹·贝尔福
My name is Jordan Belfort,

创造财富  并没有什么秘密
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

无论你是谁  来自哪里
No matter who you are, no matter where you came from,

都可以在几个月内
you too can become financially independent

实现财政独立
in just a matter of months.

你需要的是一套策略
All you need is a strategy.

在我24岁那年
When I was 24 years old,

我做了个决定  我不仅要生存还要发达
I made a decision not just to survive, but to thrive.

一开始  我没想过这一切会成真
At first I didn't feel like deals like these were possible.

但我们现在有了房子  还挣了三万三
But we have the house and we have a $33,000 profit.

我现在相信了
I certainly believe now.

好好想想
Think about it for a second.

如果你没勇气拨打乔丹·贝尔福热线
If you don't have the guts to attend Jordan Belfort's

参加他们的研讨会
Straight Line Persuasion System Seminar,

又怎么可能创造财富呢
then how do you expect to make any money?

如果你想成为百万富翁
If you want to be a millionaire someday,

鼓起勇气  做个决定吧
have some guts. Make a decision.

乔丹·贝尔福的方案很适合我
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me

因为我很努力工作
because I worked hard for it.

如果对你不起作用  那就证明你太懒了
And if it doesn't work for you, it's because you're lazy.

你只配在麦当劳工作
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

没有人能在财政独立上拖你后腿
There's nobody holding you back from financial freedom.

也没有人能阻止你挣大钱
And there's nobody stopping you from making millions.

坐在家里  无所事事
Don't just sit at home,

只会让你想要的生活与你失之交臂
or the life of your dreams will sail right past you.

我改变了这些人的命运  也能改变你的
I changed all these people's lives and I can change yours, too!

来参加我的研讨会吧
So come to my seminar!

你梦想中的生活
The life of your dreams is only...

好久不见  乔丹
Good to see you again, Jordan.

你被逮捕了
You're under arrest!

开什么玩笑
You gotta be joking!

你别开玩笑了
You're kidding me.

放开我
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

把摄像机关了
Turn that camera off.

我他妈在拍宣传片呢
I'm fucking shooting a fucking infomercial here,

你们这群混球
you fucking cocksucker!

-去你的  你个混球  -关掉摄像机
- Fuck you, you motherfucker! - Shut the fucking camera off.

别碰我  听到了吗
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

都给我滚
Go fuck yourself!

我挣的都是老实钱  你们这群混球
I'm making an honest living, you fucking piece of shit!

乔丹  让我给你点法律建议
Hey, Jordan, let me give you a little legal advice.

给我闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

去你的  你个混球
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

我挣的都是老实钱  你们这群混球
I'm making an honest living, you motherfucker!

我改过自新  成了电视名人
I clean up my act. I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

两年滴酒不沾了  却发生这事
I'm sober for two years. And this happens!

鲁格拉特在迈阿密被逮捕了
Rugrat goes and gets busted down in Miami.

我是瑞士人  不是共和党人
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

猜猜谁也被捕了  索雷尔
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

-你要揍我吗  -不  先生
- You gonna beat me? - No, sir.

我了解你们国家  你们会揍我的
Yeah, I know your country. You're gonna beat me.

这是什么鬼几率
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

日内瓦有上万个瑞士银行家
There had to be 10,000 Swiss bankers in Geneva,

鲁格拉特就找了一个
and Rugrat gets the one dumb

让自己在美国本土上被逮捕的笨蛋
enough to get himself arrested on U.S. Soil.

我知道
I know.

很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

更扯淡的是
Even more fucked was that

他被逮捕  跟我一点关系都没有
he got busted for shit that had nothing to do with me.

跟我没有半毛钱关系
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

说是一起通过海外龙舟赛
Something about laundering drug money

进行的贩毒洗钱事件
through offshore boat racing

一个叫洛奇·青木的人
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,

红花餐馆创始人
you know, the founder of Benihana.

红花餐馆
Benihana.

红你个头啊
Beni-fucking-hana!

为什么
Why?

为什么啊  老天爷
Why, why, God?

你为什么那么残忍
Why would you be so cruel

要我和一家铁板烧连锁餐厅
as to choose a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants

一起倒台
to take me down?

长话短说  索雷尔把我供了出来
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

但他首先供出了布拉德的老婆  仙黛尔
But not before he rats out Brad's wife, Chantalle,

结果发现
who, it turns out,

她每次去瑞士  都要跟他通奸
he'd been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!

-不不不  这不可能  -是的是的
- No, no, no, it's impossible. - Oui, oui, oui.

好吧
All right!

唐尼叔叔来咯
Uncle Donnie's here!

洛奇  过得还好吧
Rocky. How you doing?

我恨死那只狗了
I hate that fucking dog.

是啊  老了  变得毫无节制
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

又开始在家里随地大小便了
Starting to shit in the house again.

-我也是  -抱一个  兄弟
- Me, too. - Come here, buddy.

-很高兴见到你  兄弟  -我也是
- It's good to see you, pal. - Yeah, you, too.

很高兴见到你  坐吧
Good to see you. Sit down. Oh, man.

过得怎样  兄弟
How you doing, brother?

你懂的
You know.

糟透了  兄弟
Shitty, pal.

但还是能撑住的
But I'm hanging in there.

看看我的新脚链
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

不能踏出家里半步
Can't leave the house, you know?

都快得幽居病了
Starting to get cabin fever already.

该死的鲁格拉特
Fucking Rugrat.

那带假发的死基佬
That wig-wearing faggot.

就不该相信那混球  真想杀了他
I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him.

对天发誓  我真想掐死他
Swear to God, I want to choke him to death.

不负责任的贱货
Irresponsible little prick.

我要告诉你一件事
I'll tell you one thing.

不管是谁的生日
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

我都不去红花餐馆吃饭了
I don't care whose birthday it is.

内奥米在哪  她还好吧
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

在哪边
That's her in the house there.

你跟她打招呼  估计她也不会理你
You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back.

亲爱的内奥米
Naomi, sweetheart!

她怎么了
What's up her ass?

-她在生我的气吗  -不  你懂的
- Is she mad at me? - No, you know...

为了交保释金
We probably have to mortgage the house

我们应该要把房子抵押了
in order to make bail.

或许还要卖些东西
Probably end up selling the

才能给律师们发工资
thing in order to pay for all the lawyers.

说实话  这真是一场噩梦  兄弟
It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth.

要不然能怎么办呢  对吧
What are you gonna do, right?

斯特拉顿才是重点  情况如何
Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important.

士气如何
How's morale?

现在要合法挣钱  他们都气坏了吧
They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now?

乔丹
Jordan.

我把创始人都找来了
I got the founding partners together.

跟他们说明了情况
I talked to them about everything.

有我在呢
And I got you.

有你在是什么意思
What do you mean, you got me?

房子和钱的事都别担心  有我在
The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you.

-好了  -我爱你  兄弟
- All right. - I love you, buddy.

-我也会为你这样做的  -我知道
- You know I'd do it for you, right? - I know.

-你知道的  对吧  -我知道
- You know that, right? - I know.

真想亲遍你全身
I could fucking kiss you all over.

好了  够了  够了
All right, enough, enough.

想喝啤酒吗  兄弟
You want a beer, pal?

你在喝什么
What are you drinking?

不含酒精的东西
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

那是什么
What's that?

不含酒精的啤酒
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

-是啤酒吗  -是的  不含酒精
- It's a beer? - Yeah, with no alcohol.

如果你喝多了
But if you drink enough,

如果你喝很多的话  还是会醉吗
if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up?

不会的  不含酒精  这才是重点
No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point.

我不是科学家
I'm not a scientist.

不知道你在说什么
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

你想喝啤酒的话  我可以给你拿
I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer.

我知道  但是我不喝酒了  记得吗
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

我已经戒酒了
I don't drink anymore.

你想进屋里吸点发酵粉吗
Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder?

或者是苏打粉
Or baking soda.

无法想象再也不能嗑嗨的日子啊
Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.

-是啊  -我爱死那些日子了
- Yeah. - I love it.

戒酒的日子怎样
How's being sober?

-糟糕透了  -很无聊  对吧
- Fucking sucks. - Boring, right?

无聊到我想自杀了
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

有个词  我们不太想用
There's a term, and we don't like to use it

除非在特殊情况下
unless circumstances dictate,

我认为这个案子够特殊的了
and I think they do dictate in this case,

那个词就是  格林纳达
and the term is "Grenada."

你听说过格林纳达吗
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

没听过
No. No, I haven't.

格林纳达是个很有趣的小岛国
Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation

1983年的时候被美国侵略
that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983.

大约有九万人
It's about 90,000 people.

换句话说
And essentially, it means

这个案子我们不可能输
this case is unloseable.

懂吗
Okay?

也就是说
So, you know,

就算我们光着裤子走上法庭
we can come in, we can have our dick hanging out of our pants.

也没有人会在乎
Nobody gives a fuck.

我赢定了
I'm gonna win.

而你呢
You, sir,

就是格林纳达
are what's known as a Grenada.

你就等着判刑吧
You're looking at real prison time.

洗钱至少要吃20年牢饭
Money laundering can get you as much as 20 years.

如果不是抓到你往海外塞钱
And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you

这案子也不会那么简单
shoving cash in your mattress.

真的吗
Is that right?

乔丹
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

你要在牢里等死  直到孩子大学毕业
Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college,

那并不是我们的目的
that's not our ambition here.

还有其他人参与洗钱的勾当
There's other people involved in this, too.

我们认为他们也应该被送上法庭
We think they need to see their day in court as well.

我怎么觉得你们是要提条件呢
Why do I sense there's an offer in the air?

你看他多聪明  你是心灵感应大师吗
Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin?

全面配合  也就是过去七年间
Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list

所有同谋的详细名单提供给我们
of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years,

还要同意带窃听器
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

等会
Wait...

你刚才说让我"带窃听器"吗
did you just say "wear a wire"?

窃听器
A wire.

什么意思
What does that mean?

你想让我告密  是吗
You want me to rat? Is that it?

不  我想让你合作
No, I want you to cooperate.

不  你就是想让我告密
No. You want me to rat, right?

没错  就是让你告密
Yes. We want you to rat.

我们还就他妈的想让你干这件事  告密
That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat.

克里斯蒂的派对怎么样
How was Cristy's party?

不错
Fine.

那就好
Good.

宝贝  我今天又去见过律师了
Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today.

我有非常非常好的消息要告诉你
I have some really, really great news.

看来这件事完全不会涉及到你  亲爱的
Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey.

这我早就知道
I know that already.

没错  也是
Right. Exactly.

你本来也就没做过什么错事  对吧
You never did anything wrong in the first place, right?

闹了半天  联邦调查局
It turns out, all the FBI really

真正想让我做的就是跟他们合作
wants from me is to cooperate.

你知道吗
You know?

因为我手上掌握了很多
Turns out I have so much

关于股票市场和华尔街的内幕
information about the stock market and Wall Street,

我可以给政府省好几年的心
I could save the government years of heartache,

更别提数以百万的经济损失了
not to mention countless dollars.

但是更好的还在后头呢  宝贝
But it gets even better, babe.

如果我决定跟他们合作的话
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

我只能只需要蹲个短短四年就行了
I might only be looking at four short years,

这样一来
in which case, you know,

我们可以重新来过  也许把房子卖了
we could start fresh, maybe sell the house.

我要交的任何罚款
And any fines that I'd have to pay

也是等到我刑满出狱后才用交
wouldn't be due till after I serve my term,

所以我们还会剩下很多钱
so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know?

当然了  唯一让我有点不爽的就是
The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit

他们想让我
is this whole idea of

提供关于我朋友的信息
having to give information about my friends.

你不是说过"华尔街上无朋友"吗
Like you said, "There's no friends on Wall Street." Right?

是的  是的  没错
Right. Right. Exactly.

这件事也有好的一面  亲爱的
There's a silver lining to that, too, honey.

因为他们说最终
Because they said eventually...

最终所有人
eventually everyone's

都必须提供关于这个案件的信息
gonna have to give information on this case.

所以到了最后
So, at the end of the day,

我告密的事也不算什么了
it might not even be a factor. You know?

这是好消息  对吧
Well, that's good news. Right?

没错  没错
Yeah, yeah.

我真为你高兴
I'm really happy for you.

什么叫为我高兴啊  亲爱的
What do you mean, happy for me, sweetheart?

你应该为咱俩高兴啊  对吧
You should be happy for the both of us. Right?

-没错  -好的
- Yeah, right. - All right.

过来  宝贝
Come here, baby.

亲亲我  甜心
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

乔丹
Jordan...

来吧  宝贝
Oh, come on, baby.

我都好久没跟你做爱了  求你了
I haven't made love to you in so long. Please.

-乔丹  不要  -亲爱的  求你了

不要  乔丹  够了
No! Jordan, stop it!

我第一眼看到你就爱上你了
I've loved you since the moment I saw you.

我他妈的恨死你了  乔丹
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

-给我下去  -宝贝  别这样
- Get off me! - Baby... don't do that.

你知道我有多爱你  对吧
You know how much I love you, right?

别这样对我了  亲爱的  求你了
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

你想上我吗  乔丹
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

你想上我吗
You wanna fuck me?

很好

-你为什么要这么动  -来啊
- Why are you moving like that? - Come on.

别动
Please hold still.

因为我想让你射给我啊  宝贝
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

来啊  宝贝
Come on, babe.

射给我啊  宝贝啊
Come for me, baby.

我要你把这当做是最后一次一样
I want you to come for me

狠狠地射给我
like it's the last fucking time.

天啊
Oh, God.

上帝啊
Jesus.

宝贝
Oh, baby.

真是爽死了
That was so fucking great!

天啊
Oh, God!

这是最后一次了
That was the last time.

What do you mean, baby?

我是说  刚才那就是我们的最后一次了
I mean that was the last time we ever have sex.

你在说什么呀
What are you talking about?

我要离婚
I want a divorce.

你这是什么意思  你要离婚
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

你在说什么啊  你要离婚
What's that supposed to mean, you want a divorce?

放开我  我要跟你离婚
Get off me! I want a divorce.

你刚刚才跟我上完床
You just made love to me.

你他妈的是什么毛病啊
What the fuck is wrong with you?

我不爱你了  乔丹
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

你不爱我了
Oh, you don't love me?

你已经不爱我了
