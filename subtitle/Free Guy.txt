这里是自由城 \n This is Free City.
你瞧这哥们儿 他是一个戴墨镜的人 \n Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.
所有戴墨镜的人都是主角 \n And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.
他们是这座城市的主人 个个放浪形骸 \n They have a devilmaycare attitude and they run this town.
你好帅哦 \n You are so hot.
这还用说 \n Oh, I know.
瞧 那压根就不是他的车 \n See? That's not even his car.
那也不是他太太 \n Or his wife.
戴墨镜的人想干什么就干什么 \n For the sunglasses people, they get to do anything they want.
他们肩负各种任务 \n They go on all sorts of missions.
发型超酷炫 服装超霸气 \n They got cool hair, cool clothes.
法律在他们眼里都算不上法律 顶多算是友情提醒 \n I mean, laws aren't really laws to them. They're more like mild suggestions.
比如 这哥们儿估计是不会把车还回去了 \n Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.
还会把车上的女士一起带走 \n Or that nice lady.
懂我的意思了吧 这就是主角 \n See what I mean? Hero.
我的名字叫盖 我就生活在这座人间乐园 \n My name is Guy, and I live in paradise.

感觉自己自由了 \n when you're totally weightless, it feels like you're free.
恋爱了 \n In love.
自由 你说得对 \n Free. What you said. Yeah.
我好想吻你 这样奇怪吗 \n I really wanna kiss you. Is that weird?
你想吻我 \n You want to kiss me?
我想狠狠地吻你 \n I wanna kiss you so badly.
你想狠狠地吻我 \n You want to kiss me badly?
-是的 不是 -不是 \n - No! - No?
不是的 我想好好地吻你 \n No, no, no, no, no. I wanna kiss you well.
我就是太傻了 \n I mean, I'm an idiot,
所以有时会说傻话 \n so I say things like an idiot sometimes.
不 你不傻 \n No, you're not. You're not.
我是说 \n I mean, um,
要是你会操作 那就来吧 \n uh, if you know how to, go for it.
我会操作 \n I know how.
好的 \n Okay.
我来了 \n Here it goes.
这感觉比冰淇淋美妙多了 \n That was so much better than ice cream.
哇哦 \n Whoa!
好像有人在敲门 \n I think someone's at the door.
是啊 \n I'll say.
今天很开心 \n Well, this was great.
-是啊 -我们约个时间再见 好吗 \n - Yeah, it was. - Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?
当然 一言为定 \n Yes. Definitely.
要不在现实世界里见 \n Maybe in the real world.
什么 \n What?
好 在哪儿都行 好的 \n Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-好的 再见 -好的 \n - Okay. Bye. - Okay.
再见 燃烧瓶 \n Bye, Molotov.
那个... 我的真名叫米莉 \n Hey…  my real name is Millie.
我的真名还是叫盖 \n My real name continues to be Guy.
米莉 开门 米莉 是我 键盘 快开门 \n Millie, open up! Millie, it's me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!
米莉 是我 快开门 \n Millie! It's me, open up!
-干嘛 -你说对了 \n - What? - You were right.
-你说对了 -那就请进吧 \n - You were right. - Oh, come on in.
你说得对 我们的代码在《自由城》里 \n You were right. Our code, it is in Free City
不仅如此 它成功了 \n and, Millie, it works.
我知道 可我们没有证据 \n Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.
先别管什么证据了 \n Just forget about that for one second.
我是说我们的游戏 《无限人生》 \n I'm saying that our game, Life Itself,
让游戏角色成长 改变 有血有肉... \n where characters would grow and change and feel real…
-怎么了... -成功了 \n - Yeah?… - worked.
-键盘 -人工智能起作用了 \n - Keys. - The AI worked.
所以《自由城》才这么有真实感 大家才这么喜欢玩 \n It's the reason why Free City is so realistic and people love it so much.
当然 它不像《无限人生》 \n And of course it doesn't look the same.
没有瀑布 没有蝴蝶 没有独角兽 \n There's no waterfalls, there's no butterflies and unicorns,
所有角色的形象也都改了 这很正常 \n all the characters have different skins. Of course they do.
但《自由城》用的底层代码是同一个 就是我们的代码 \n But the underlying code in the game is the same. Our code.
盖 他的进化程度 \n And Guy, I mean, he has evolved way further
远超出我们的想象 \n than we thought was even possible.
等等 你说那个非玩家角色的黑客 \n Wait, are you talking about the hacker in the NPC skin?
米莉 我要告诉你一件事儿 那个蓝衣小哥... \n Millie, I'm talking about the fact that Blue Shirt Guy…
怎么了 \n Yeah?
...他并不是个玩家 \n …is not a player.
他是通过算法生成的 而他以为自己是活人 \n He is an algorithm who thinks he's alive.
我是说 从理论上讲 他确实是活着的 \n I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.
他是史上第一个真正的人工智能 \n He is the first real artificial intelligence.
-不 -我懂 \n - No! No. - I know.
-不 这不是真的 -就是真的 \n - No, no, no. - Yeah, yeah.
-盖 我的盖 -对 \n - Guy? My Guy? - Guy.
-我还一直跟他... -你的盖 \n - One who has been…  - Your Guy?
-天哪... -这是好事儿啊 \n - Holy…  - This is a good thing.
不 一点也不好 \n No, it's really bad.
米莉 他的代码规模是原来的几千倍 \n Millie, his code, it's thousands of times the size it should be.
我们成功了 米莉 \n We did it, Mills.
我们成功了 我们想创造的东西真的实现了 \n We did it. Everything that we wanted to create, it actually happened.
明白吗 你知不知道非玩家角色有了自己的生活 \n Okay? Did you know that the NPCs have private lives?
有个咖啡师不断尝试学会了做卡布奇诺 \n One of the baristas learned how to make a cappuccino through trial and error.
你知道那有多难吗 连我都不会 \n I mean, that's really difficult. I can't even do that.
早上用燕麦奶打个奶泡我都打不来 \n I can't even froth my own oat milk in the morning.
还有 游戏里那个金发美女 \n And the Bombshell character in the game
她写了一本自传来毫不留情地抨击 \n wrote a memoir that's a searing indictment
父权制下的两性关系... \n of gender roles, the patriarchy…
虽然部分内容有点说教 但总体都挺好 \n It's a little preachy in parts, but overall, it's pretty good.
米莉 我们应该庆祝一下 \n Millie, we have to celebrate!
-不 这不是真的 -你在说什么 \n - No, this can't be happening. - What are you talking about?
-这不是我们一直追求的吗 -我让他吻了我 \n - This is what we've been working for! - No, I let him kiss me!
就是这样 \n So, yeah.
等等 你在说啥 你让谁吻了你 \n I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?
盖 \n Guy.
盖 \n Guy?
我多少年来都没有和一个好男人接过吻了 \n The first time I kiss a nontoxic guy in like forever
结果他居然不是真人 \n and of course he's not even real!
呃 游戏里没有这个操作 \n Uh, there's not a button for that.
喔 他可会操作了 \n Oh, he found the button.
-打住 -好 \n - Okay. - Yeah.
我现在... 我现在非常懵 \n I am…  I'm so confused.
-怎么这么热 -甚至有些好奇 \n - Why is it so hot? - and surprisingly curious.
你让一个人工智能 \n You let an artificially intelligent
-游戏角色吻了你 -好吧 \n - video game character kiss you? - Oh, okay,
你别用这种口气行吗 \n can you just stop saying it like that?
你还觉得很... \n And then you thought that would be…
见过他你就懂了 \n Because you have got to meet him, Keys.
他本人既风趣又体贴 还特别帅 \n He's funny, and he's sweet, and he's so handsome.
天哪 我居然真这么说了 \n Oh, my God, now I'm saying it out loud.
米莉 你好好想想 他现在才四岁左右 \n Also, Millie, food for thought, he's like four.
-真的吗 你给我来这套 -真的 \n - Really? You're gonna do that? - Really.
你把我说得好变态 \n Wow, you just made that really creepy.
米莉 糗事先不提 这项成果一旦公布 \n Millie, put all that aside. Weird or not, when people find out about this,
你说不定能得诺贝尔奖 天哪 \n you could win a Nobel Prize. Oh, God.
怎么了 \n What?
天哪 要是被他们发现了... \n Oh, my God, if they see this…
被谁发现 \n What? What is it?
安托万 还能有谁 \n Antwan. What else?
这个骗子 他骗了我们的代码 \n He's lying. He lied about using our code,
还骗粉丝说续作能向下兼容 \n he's been lying about the game being backwards compatible.
《自由城1》的事儿估计也是骗人的 \n I think he's lying about Free City 1.
你到底在说什么 \n What are you talking about?
看见没 新任务 新场景... \n Look. You see? There's not one mission, not one location…
一个《自由城1》的角色都没有 \n I mean, there's not even a single character from Free City 1 on here.
《自由城2》不是升级版本... \n Free City 2 is not an update…
-是另起炉灶 -没错 \n - It's a replacement. - Exactly.
等下周一《自由城2》上线... \n So when Free City 2 launches on Monday…
蓝衣小哥 盗用代码的证据 所有数据都会被删除 \n Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code, everything will be deleted.
他不能那么做 \n He can't do that.
我们面对的可是人工生命 这太残忍了 \n I mean, this is artificial life we're dealing with. I mean, that's insane.
我们完了 \n We're screwed.
也许没完 \n Maybe not.
要是能在游戏里找到我们的原始场景 \n If we can find our original build in the game,
就能证明安托万盗用了我们的代码 \n it'll prove that Antwan used our code without properly licensing it.
要赶在《自由城2》上线之前找到 \n And we just have to find it before Free City 2 launches.
还剩48小时 \n We have 48 hours.
我找过了 你知道的 \n I've looked, Keys. You know I have.
我知道 \n I know you have.
但现在我们知道蓝衣小哥是谁了 \n But now that we both know about Blue Shirt Guy,
也许他能帮忙 \n maybe he can help?
那我就得告诉他真相 \n That would mean I'd have to tell him.
米莉 等续作一上线 他就不存在了 \n Millie, he's not gonna exist once the sequel launches.
他的世界就毁灭了 \n His whole world's about to end.
你觉得他会放过拯救世界的机会吗 \n Don't you think he'd want a chance to save it?
-拿好 -谢谢 \n - Here you go. - Thank you.
-不用谢 -盖 \n - You got it. - Guy?
盖 我有话跟你说 \n Guy, we need to talk.
你的声音怎么变了 怎么没有澳洲口音了 \n What's going on with your voice? Where's your Australian accent?
英国口音 \n British.
是不是澳洲口音我还是听得出的 \n I think I know an Australian accent when I see one.
我把口音特效关了 \n I turned off the accent filter.
这是我真正的声音 \n This is me.
好听 \n Good.
听着 我要跟你说一件很重要的事儿 \n Look, I have to tell you something really important.
你结婚了 \n Are you married?

我得承认 这里面至少有一半是我杀的 \n Now, I'm not gonna lie, that's at least 50% my fault.
我以前喜欢把游戏里的路人杀个精光 \n I used to shoot all the secondary characters

然后把他们装起来 \n And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit.
谁都不知道这个蓝衣小哥到底是谁 \n Who the hell even knows who this Blue Shirt Guy is?
但他让我开始思考 \n But I'll tell you this, he's got me thinkin'
该怎么看待非玩家角色 怎么玩游戏 \n about NPCs and how I play the game.
这游戏就不是做给他这种人玩的 不是让你当好人的 \n The game wasn't even made for someone like this, for a player to be a good guy.
蓝衣小哥还很可爱 \n He's also a really cute guy.
不光是脸 他整个人就是一个大可爱 \n And not just the face, you know, like the whole thing.
而且 他让我意识到... \n And, honestly, it's got me realizing…
我们对非玩家角色的看法也许一直以来都是错的 \n maybe we've been thinking about NPCs wrong this whole time.
我觉得蓝衣小哥是一种象征 \n I think Blue Shirt Guy's like a symbol, you know?
也许我们可以活成自己梦想的样子 \n Like, maybe people can be whatever they want.
他像是一个偶像 是这么说的吗 \n He's like an icon. Is that the right word?
他告诉我们人生有无限可能 \n Like, he reminds us of what's possible.
而且他现在非常火爆 \n Also, he's like crazy hot.
我的天哪 我居然那么用力打这些人 \n Oh, my God, totally. I'd hit those pixels hard.
我们应该向蓝衣小哥学习 \n We should all be more like Blue Shirt Guy.
也许我们应该停止杀戮了 \n Maybe we just stop the killing.
他死定了 听到了吗 \n He's dead! You hear me?
把他的画面调出来 \n The guy, put him up here.
打在大屏幕上 \n Put him up here on the screen. Put him on the screen.
让我好好看看他 就是他 \n Make me see him. There he is.

你踢不了 \n You can't.
你再说一遍 \n Oh, I'm sorry, what?
你踢不了 \n You can't.
为什么 \n Why not?
因为他不是黑客 他是非玩家角色 \n Because he's not a hacker, Antwan. He's an NPC.
你不会是要说 \n You're tryin' to tell me that all this shit
非玩家角色有自我意识了那种屁话吧 \n about a selfaware NPC is real?
对 我也不知道为什么 但他就是活了 \n Yeah. I don't know how or why, but he's real.
我要怎么办 我要怎么办 \n What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
好的 好的 \n Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
想一想 怎么办 想到了 \n What to do? What to do? Got it.
鲤鱼打挺 \n And kipup!

那能让他的人工智能重置吗 \n How do we reset his AI?
大家开动脑筋 快点儿 出出点子 \n Ideas, people. Come on. Hit me. Ideas.
可以直接重启服务器 \n You could just reboot the server.
继续说 \n Keep talking.

你 \n You.

安托万把我们的场景藏在地平线背后... \n Antwan hid our original build past the horizon, making it invisible…
但他忘了去除反射的倒影 \n but he forgot to scrub the reflections.
它就在那儿 只是我们看不见而已 \n It's still out there, Guy. We just can't see it.
只要能到那儿我们就有证据了 \n If we can get there, that is the evidence we need.
走到海边就会被拦住 我试过 \n You can't go past the water line. I tried.
我们找人帮忙 \n We need help.
亏安托万想得出把原始场景藏在一个 \n Antwan found a way to hide it in plain sight
