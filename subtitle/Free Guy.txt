这里是自由城
This is Free City.

你瞧这哥们儿 他是一个戴墨镜的人
Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.

所有戴墨镜的人都是主角
And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.

他们是这座城市的主人 个个放浪形骸
They have a devilmaycare attitude and they run this town.

你好帅哦
You are so hot.

这还用说
Oh, I know.

瞧 那压根就不是他的车
See? That's not even his car.

那也不是他太太
Or his wife.

戴墨镜的人想干什么就干什么
For the sunglasses people, they get to do anything they want.

他们肩负各种任务
They go on all sorts of missions.

发型超酷炫 服装超霸气
They got cool hair, cool clothes.

法律在他们眼里都算不上法律 顶多算是友情提醒
I mean, laws aren't really laws to them. They're more like mild suggestions.

比如 这哥们儿估计是不会把车还回去了
Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.

还会把车上的女士一起带走
Or that nice lady.

懂我的意思了吧 这就是主角
See what I mean? Hero.

我的名字叫盖 我就生活在这座人间乐园
My name is Guy, and I live in paradise.

早安 小鱼鱼
Good morning, Goldie.

我从记事起就一直住在自由城
I've lived here in Free City my whole life.

有一个好朋友 有一条小金鱼
I've got a best friend, I've got a goldfish,

还有一份银行的工作
and I work at the bank.

简直不能更完美
What more could a guy want?

周日天气晴好
Sunday should be warm and sunny

伴有零星飞车枪击
with just a scattering of drivebys.

适宜去海滩游玩 但别去杀手海滩
Great day for the beach, but not Hitman's Beach,

那里埋有地雷并有叛乱武装直升机
which will be mined and sprayed with highcaliber fire

在进行重火力扫射...
from a renegade gunship stolen by…

每天早晨
And every morning,

我都会用一杯全世界最美味的咖啡
I start my day with the most delicious coffee

开启新的一天
in the whole, wide, whole world.

中焙咖啡 加一份奶油 两份糖
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

你真懂我
You know it. Mmm.

嗯
Mmm!

真的是好滚烫
That is unexpectedly hot.

天哪 太美味了
Jeez, that's good.

感觉就像第一次那么爽 好喝炸了
It's like losing my virginity, but in my mouth.

谢谢你用爱调制的咖啡
Thank you for making this with such love.

不客气
You're welcome.

强尼警官
Officer Johnny!

祝你今天开心 盖
Have a good one, Guy.

别错过今天 要活出精彩
Don't have a good day, have a great day!

逗我呢
Hold the fudge.

这么拉风的战靴居然没人抢 今天就是“剁手”日
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed up those bad boys? Today is the day.

-每天你都这么说 -小宝贝等着我
- Like every other day. - I'll be back for those.

你好 盖先生 您的当前余额为：\N187.03美元
就差一点儿
Oh! So close.

这杯咖啡绝对是天下第一
Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee of all time.

我真想给它写首歌
I wanna write a song about it.

我想伴着你的歌跳支舞
I wanna dance to that song with my body.

我爱这种生活
I love my life.

找到自己的圈子一辈子不挪窝
There's something about finding your lane and just staying in it.

所以才叫舒适圈 太舒适了
That's why they call 'em comfort zones, they're so damn comfortable.

噢 乔伊
Oh, Joe!

周一太难了 对吧 乔伊
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

-太对了 盖 -难啊
- You said it, Guy. - Yeah.

在自由城 我的生活应有尽有
In Free City, I have everything I need.

别错过今天...
Don't have a good day…

...要活出精彩
…have a great day.

谢谢
Thank you.

慢走
Take care.

唯独少了一样东西
Except one thing.

他们好幸福
Seem happy.

不用羡慕人家 你也会找到另一半的
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.

不用安慰我 巴迪
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

找了这么久都没找到
Feel like I've been looking for her forever, you know?

也许这就是命
Maybe it's not meant to be.

所有人都给我趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

-我很清楚我要找的她是什么样 -我来猜猜
- I know the woman I'm looking for. - Oh, let me guess.

-她有与众不同的幽默感 -幽默感
- A woman with an offbeat sense of humor. - Sense of humour.

-还爱听流行天后的歌曲 -流行天后
- An obsession with feelgood diva pop. - Diva pop.

对 就是这样
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

她住进我的心房就不肯搬走了
She's rented space in my brain and she won't move out.

而且我也不想让她搬走
And you know what? I don't want her to.

她既不会住进去也不会搬出来
Well, guess what? She won't move either in or out.

知道为什么吗 因为她根本就不存在
You know why? 'Cause she doesn't exist.

-只是你的幻想 -你好狠毒
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy. - That's cruel. You're cruel.

-你的良心坏透了 -我实话实说
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten. - I'm being real.

谁都别逞英雄 很快会没事儿的
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

怎么样 下班去海边喝一杯
So how about it? Beers on the beach after work?

下班当然要去海边喝一杯
Of course we're going for beers on the beach after work.

想想就好开心
That makes me so happy.

我也是
Me too.

你有什么货
What have you got?

隐藏关卡存在的证据 你是在找这个吧
Proof of a secret level. That's what you're looking for, right?

你有视频还是截图
You got a video or a screen grab?

都没有 但我知道谁有
Nope. But I know who does.

知道浪费我时间会有什么下场吗
Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

噢喔 还挺野的啊
Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play.

嘿 你真是英国人还是开了口音特效
Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter?

没准儿咱们能奔个现
'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

我对啃老的宅男没兴趣 谢谢
I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

还挺幽默 哈？
Got jokes, huh?

这张地图上有那个人的储藏库的位置
Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house.

你要有本事进得去的话 可以看看56号视频
Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.

问你个问题
Now, I got a question.

那个视频里到底有什么特别的
What's so special about this video clip anyway?

凡是打听它的人都得死 就这么特别
What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

懂了 真有意思
Mmm, I see. Fun. Yeah, that's fun.

姐们儿 你这脾气也太爆了
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

说真的 你是为了战利品还是经验值
But seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

我警告过你了
Those are questions.

你看见最后那个劫匪穿的鞋了吗
Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

两点半那个吗
The 2:30?

不是 四点钟那个
No, the 4:00.

那人穿了双泡沫软底高帮运动鞋
The threequarter hightop, gorgeous foam soles.

踩在我脸上时几乎感觉不到
I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

厉害了
Oh, man.

在大城市生活 就像做梦一样
Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it.

把它给我
Give it to me!

好像要下雨了
Looks like rain.

有谁见到过我的猫了吗
Has anyone seen my cat?

知道吗 大家总是说
You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like,

“盖的脸最适合被人踩”
"Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."

鞋子踩在你脸上时 你仿佛像没事儿一样
I mean, when you put it on there, you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

别错过今天 要活出精彩
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

我超爱这首歌
Love that song.

这句还真没听过
That's a new one.

回神
Hey!

是她
That's her.

谁啊
Her who?

我的梦中情人
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

天哪
She exists.

我要去跟她认识一下
I'm gonna go talk to her.

等等 冷静点儿 兄弟 她戴着墨镜呢
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

所以呢
So?

你说呢
Whatcha mean "so?"

戴墨镜的人不会搭理我们的
So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.

-你知道的 -我总得试一下
- You know that! - I gotta try.

等等 盖 盖
Look, Guy! Guy!

盖 说好的去海边喝一杯呢
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

Excuse me!

We usually don't put the chairs on the tables,

点一小杯咖啡坐四个小时的小姐
onesmallcoffeeoverfourhours girl.

你很迷这个游戏啊 我十二岁的侄子也迷得不行
You really like that game, huh? My 12yearold nephew's addicted.

好像所有人都着了这游戏的魔
Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

你说《自由城》吗 不是
Oh, Free City? Ah. No.

我要告这个游戏的发行商
I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher

而我要的证据就在游戏里
and the evidence that I need is in the game.

-然后我就用代码... -噢
- So then I had my codes… - Oh,

可惜要关门了 不然真想听你说下去
I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this.

早安 小鱼鱼
Good morning, Goldie.

中焙咖啡 加一份奶油 两份糖
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

中焙咖啡 加一份奶油 两份糖
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

这个嘛 今天我想尝尝卡布奇诺
Actually, I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today.

“卡布奇诺” 我喜欢说这个词
Ooh. "Cappuccino." I enjoy saying that.

念起来丝般顺滑
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

你说什么
Excuse me?

我想要一杯卡布奇诺
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

-谢谢 -但是 你该喝中焙咖啡 加一份奶油 两份糖
- Please. - But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

你就该喝这个 每个人都喝这个
That's what you get. That's what everyone gets.

每一天都是这样
Every day. Always.

-我就是... -有人是不是想吃枪子儿了
- Well, I…  - Somebody's about to get shot.

强尼警官
Officer Johnny.

我就是想今天换个口味
I just thought I'd try something different today, you know?

什么都行 好吗
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

大家好
Hi.

哈 我就是想考验考验你
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.

中焙咖啡 加一份奶油 两份糖 谢谢
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.

我逗你的
I'm joking.

就想考验你 跟你开个玩笑
Just keeping you on your toes. I was kidding.

他开玩笑的
He was just kidding!

你以为我会舍得放弃你精湛的咖艺吗
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry?

怎么可能
No way, no how.

好烫
Mmm. That's hot.

感觉就像 耶稣为我的舌头施洗...
It's like Jesus washed my tongue…

快完事儿的时候他对我爸说
but right before he finished, he finally told my dad,

“这孩子已经很完美了”
"He's good enough."

谢谢你的咖啡 强尼警官
Thank you so much. Officer Johnny!

祝你今天开心 盖
Have a good one, Guy.

卡布奇诺
Cappuccino.

别错过今天...
Don't have a good day…

...要活出精彩 尽量吧
…have a great day, I guess.

再见 慢走
Okay. Good day to you.

所有人都给我趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

谁都别逞英雄 很快会没事儿的
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

那个女孩儿
That's the girl.

还不死心呢
We've been over this.

你昨天已经试过了 没结果
You tried to talk to her yesterday, it didn't work.

以后也不会有结果
It will never work.

她戴着墨镜
She's wearing sunglasses.

我们不招惹戴墨镜的人
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

也许我也应该弄一副墨镜
Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

你胡说什么呢 你不能
What? What are you talking about? You can't do that.

噢 天哪 我还在这儿干什么
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

你好
Hi.

你说什么
What'd you say?

你好
Hi.

我想借你的墨镜
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.

我想...
I'm just gonna…

我想借你的墨镜用一下
I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

你小子是不是想造反
What the hell do you think you're doing?

给我回去趴好
Go back to your side, man.

他只是个非玩家角色 干掉这个狗娘养的...
He's just an NPC. Waste that mother…

我就借用一下下
Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay?

-给我退后 -就一下下 很快还你
- Back off! I said, don't! - Just real quick. Real quick.

我说了 不行
Stop!

你脑子短路了吗
You broken or somethin'?

我是抢银行的
I'm the robber!

你是趴在地上被我抢的
You're the guy who lies down and takes it!

你就好好趴着吧
Please, just stay down!

我叫你给我趴好
I said, stay down!

盖 你不能这么做
Guy, you don't do this, man.

你不是那种人
This isn't you.

不会干这种事儿
You don't do this.

没准儿我会呢
Maybe I do.

到底什么情况...
What is wrong with this…

这什么破任务
stupid mission?

都说了叫你一枪崩了他
I told you to smoke his ass.

放手
Let go!

用完马上还给你
I'll give them right back.

我说了...
I said…

盖
Guy?

他想歇会儿
He's just resting.

是歇菜了好吗
In pieces!

这家伙死了
That man is dead!

他困死了
He's so sleepy.

我把你的枪放下...
I'm just gonna put your gun down…

就放在这里...
right here…

你一醒来就能看见
for when you wake.

-好吗 -盖
- Okay? - Guy.

盖 你要上哪儿去
Guy! Where you goin'?

新任务 抢劫银行
医疗包
请问一下
Excuse me.

你能看见这个吗
Do you see this?

周五前把季度报告交到我这儿
Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

跑起来
Giddy up!

感觉如获新生
I feel brand new.

你太菜了
Loser.

这是什么情况
What is happening?

这么多钱
So much money.

你好 盖先生 您的当前余额为：\N2187.03美元
嘿 鼠标 来看这个
Hey, Mouser, check this out.

怎么了 键盘
What's up, Keys?

要我看什么
What am I looking at?

是这样的 有个玩家被人抢了墨镜
Okay, so this user, he gets his glasses stolen

还被杀了
and then killed.

被一个非玩家角色杀了
The guy was smoked by a nonplayable character.

银行抢劫 任务失败
非玩家角色 不可能
An NPC? That's impossible.

对 没可能
Yeah, exactly.

玩家角色穿不了非玩家角色的皮肤
Nobody can equip an NPC skin on their avatar.

是啊 那你把这菜鸡踢出去 永久封号 不就完事儿了
Yeah, so you just boot the trashass noob and ban him for life, you're done.

我试过了 但是...
I tried that, but I…

我追踪不到他
I can't trace him.

不管这个人是谁 肯定是个高手
Whoever it is, they're good.

你该提高一下业务能力了
Hmm. You gotta be better at your job, buddy.

我的能力已经很高了
I'm pretty good.

我们上线瞅瞅去
I'll see you on the inside.

请选择皮肤
Select your skin.

键盘 你穿什么皮肤
Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

老样子 风骚警察
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,

大大的手枪 浓浓的胡子
big guns, bigger mustache.

又骚又野 我喜欢
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

弱弱地问一句 你穿什么
Almost scared to ask, but what are you going with?

全身毛茸茸 荧光少女粉 就问你怕不怕
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink. You should be very afraid.

我好怕怕哦
I'm terrified.

哥们儿走起
Let's do this.

说真的 哥们儿
Seriously, man.

你这身小兔兔装真心有点过了
I'm just being honest, I think the bunny suit is just a little much.

你再说一遍
Excuse me?

好吧
Right.

大兔子 行了吧 我错了
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

嘿 那边的老处男 你给我过来
Hey, 40yearold virgin! Get over here!

快点儿
Let's go!

就是你 穿卡其裤的
Uhhuh. Captain Khakis.

-过来 快点儿 -赶紧的 兄弟
- Come here. Come on, bud. - Go, let's go.

-过来点儿 -找到你了
- Closer. - There he is.

蓝衣小哥
Blue shirt guy.

蓝衣
Blue shirt?

没错
Yes.

你好 警官
Hello, Officer.

你好 兔子
Rabbit.

你这皮肤不错嘛
Nice skin.

谢谢夸奖 你人真好
Thank you. That's sweet.

怎么弄的
How'd you get it?

这个嘛 我想主要是爸妈遗传
Well, uh, mostly genetics, I think. I'm pretty lucky.

让我拥有天生水润好皮肤
I have naturally dewy skin.

听着 水润型男
Listen up, Neutrogena.

你知道规矩 不能披着这张皮到处晃
You know you can't go around looking like that. The rules are clear.

还有
And another thing.

-也不可以盗用非玩家角色的形象 -不可以
- You can't hack the NPC avatars. - No, sir!

-这样会扰乱任务系统... -乱成团
- It screws up the mission load…  - Screws it up!

...破坏游戏体验
…and it makes the game look bad.

-坏透了 -对
- Horrible! - Yeah.

十句话里我只听懂了半句
I got, like, 5% of that.

把皮肤脱掉
Lose the skin!

我... 脱掉
I…  Lose?

我要怎么把自己的皮肤脱掉
How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

脱掉 哥们儿
Take it off, man.

快点脱吧 磨唧什么呢
Just take it off. What are you doing?

-什么 -没跟你开玩笑
- What? - Seriously.

-一整套 你的脸 你的衣服 -怎么脱
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit. - How?

-全部脱掉 -快脱
- Everything. Ditch it. - Take it off.

不然的话 我们就杀了你
If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

-为什么 -见你一次杀你一次
- Why? - And we're gonna keep killing you.

到底为什么
Still why?

等我们挖出你的真实身份...
Until we do find out who you are…

就要把你踢出去 永久驱逐
and then we're gonna ban you for life.

好的 不是 我很想配合你们
Okay. No, no. Okay, I want to comply.

但你们下通牒的顺序把我搞懵了
I just find the order of those threats very confusing.

-敬酒不吃吃罚酒 -把他毙了
- Somebody's about to get shot. - Light him up

不是
No.

出来吧 蓝衣小哥
Come on, Blue Shirt.

还可跳跃3次
没想到还有这一手 你想到了吗
Oh! Didn't see that one coming. Did you see that one coming?

吓了我一小跳
Scared me a little bit.

我们来收拾你了 蓝衣小哥
We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!

来抓你喽
Coming to get ya.

我们要来抓你喽
We're coming to get ya.

等等 等等
Wait! Wait!

你们听我解释
I can explain everything.

我戴上这副墨镜以后 突然能看到好多东西
I found these glasses and then I can see things now.

好多... 不存在的东西
Things that…  Whoa, whoa. Things that aren't there.

但又确实存在
Except they are there.

你们可能觉得我疯了 但我没疯
I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

尽管逃吧 蓝衣小哥 你无处可藏
You can run, Blue Shirt, but you cannot hide.

投降吧 蓝衣小哥 你逃不过兔子的追击
Come on, Blue Shirt. You can't escape the rabbit.

我们可是顶级掠食者
We're apex predators.

你就是我们的盘中餐
All we do is bone and brawl and slit throats.

太高了 太高了
Too high! Too high!

想跟我们玩是吧 你给我等着
Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt? Watch this.

我没耐心陪他玩了 键盘 我要开管理员模式灭了这个渣渣
I tire of these games, Keys. It's time I went godmode on this beyotch.

好啊 那就来吧
Okay, bring it.

说来就来 咱们上
Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

玩这个我可太擅长了
I'm so, so good at this.

游戏结束了 银行出纳
Time's up, bank teller!

不会吧
Nope!

我不会死
I can't die!

我永远都不会死
I'm never gonna die!

就这样 蓝衣小哥结束了他黯然神伤的一生
And that was the heartbreaking story of Blue Shirt Guy.

结束
The end.

-不对劲儿 -怎么了
- Doesn't make sense. - What?

我看了后台数据
I just checked the server stats.

我们明明把他杀了 但在线玩家数没变
We killed Blue Shirt and the number of players online didn't change.

小差错而已
It's just a glitch, man.

-没什么大不了 -我明白
- It's not a big deal. - I know, I know.

-但这种情况是第一次出现 -键盘
- It just seems like that's something new, you know? - Keys,

我知道你在想什么 别告诉安托万
I know what you're thinking, okay? You should not talk to Antwan.

我觉得有必要让他知道一下
I just think it's important to be transparent, okay?

不行
Uhuh. No.

安托万在忙续作上线的事儿 你去找他 他要么不当回事儿
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch. He's either not gonna care

要么大发雷霆 把锅扣我们头上
or he's gonna get pissed and then he's gonna blame us.

我不懂你怎么还没搞清楚状况
So, I don't know what you haven't figured out about the whole situation.

你不是什么麻省理工的天才 独立游戏设计师吗
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius, indie game designer?

干嘛要在这里处理投诉
What are you doing down here dealing with complaints?

这是一个很长很悲惨的故事 主角梦想破灭
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams,

生无可恋 还欠了一屁股助学贷款
desperation, and a mountain of college debt.

你不会有兴趣听的
You do not wanna hear about that.

确实没兴趣
You're absolutely right.

这个故事听上去就很致郁很无聊 满满的白人凡尔赛味道
That story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege.

别告诉安托万
Don't talk to Antwan.

我们做梦都没想到会有这一天
We never dreamt this would've happened.

《无限人生》本质上是放置类游戏
I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially a fishbowl game.

玩家不是在玩它 而是在看着它成长
People aren't playing it, they're watching it grow.

确切地说这是一个观察游戏
It's a strictly observational experience

观察计算机生成的角色互动 甚至进化
where computer generated characters interact and evolve.

我们很乐意把它奉献给大家
I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

这就是键盘的魅力之处 他完全不知道自己有多天才
That's what's so charming about Keys, he's clueless about his own genius.

不 米莉才是天才
Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

是她从无到有创造了这个人工智能引擎
Uh, she built the AI engine from the ground up.

我想问点偏生活的问题
So, to get a little personal,

你们每天的生活动力是什么
what's the thing that gets you up in the morning?

中焙咖啡 加一份奶油 两份糖
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

还有 怎么说的来着
What's the other thing?

对了 对验证程序的无限渴望
Oh, yeah. An insatiable thirst for validation.

-她是认真的 -很认真
- She's not kidding. - I'm not.

那你呢
How about you?

-代码 -代码
- Code. - Code?

-代码 -就是代码
- Code. - Code, yeah.

又来了
Here we go.

代码不是简单的0和1 其中蕴含信息
'Cause it's not just zeros and ones, it's hidden messages.

我觉得我不是在写代码 而是在写作
I like to think of myself, actually, as not a code writer, but an author.

只不过我用0和1来代替言语 因为言语会背叛你
I just use zeros and ones instead of words 'cause words will let you down.

而0和1就不会 0和1简直是酷到丧心病狂
But zeros and ones, never. Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

-他是认真的 -很认真
- He's not kidding. - I'm not.

我实在很好奇
Now, I've gotta ask.

你们俩之间显然有很多火花
There is a lot of chemistry between the two of you.

-那你们有没有更进一步... -没有
- Has this evolved into more than…  - No.

-不可能 -没有 我们只是纯友谊
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic. - No, no, no. We're friends.

-最要好的朋友 -是朋友
- We're like best friends. - Friendship.

全球游戏发行巨头苏乐美
And now your game is gonna be released by Soonami,

准备要发行你们的游戏了
one of the biggest publishers in the world.

-像做梦一样 -是啊
- It's crazy, actually. - It is, yeah.

苏乐美跟你们的合作有些出人意料
It does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing, though.

是啊 我也不明白他们是怎么想的
Yeah, I didn't totally get it either.

不过米莉在这方面的直觉很准...
But Millie's got a real instinct for these things…

安托万是个天才
Antwan is a genius.

虽然他性格傲慢又讨人嫌 但他的商业能力有目共睹
He's brash and obnoxious, but he's really good at what he does.

他让我们的作品有机会被更多人看到
It's a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience.

-没眼看了 这两个小傻瓜 -天哪
- God, those two were young and dumb. - Jeez.

你现在都开始私闯民宅了吗
So we're breaking and entering now?

给一个心比黑洞还黑 血比冰还冷的人渣打工是什么感觉
How does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit?

求求你走吧 我没法和你说话
You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

人羞愧的时候是会这样
Aw, shame will have that effect.

不 米莉 我真的不能跟你说话
No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

我甚至不能看见你 我现在是看你背后的东西
I can't even see you. I'm literally focusing on background objects

只要看见你的嘴在动 我就会违反保密协议 就会被开除
because looking at your lips move violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

被安托万开除吗 那个偷我们游戏的贼
Aw, fired by Antwan, the guy who stole our work?

不 他买下了我们的游戏然后雪藏了
No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

你还活在过去 困在过去 人要往前走
All right? You're living in the past. You are stuck. You gotta move on.

我要怎么往前走
How can I move on?

你怎么能做到
How can you?

安托万偷了我们的人工智能引擎 用在他那个破游戏上
Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter.

他真用了吗 我不太确定
Did he, Millie? Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

我们的游戏复杂精美 引人入胜
Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting

《自由城》虽然很火 但内容却白痴到让我想哭
and Free City, it may be popular, but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

那就别帮他了 帮我一起打垮他
Then stop defending him and help me beat his ass.

-米莉 我... -键盘 他偷了我们的心血
- Millie, I'm…  - Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

他现在矢口否认就是为了
And now he's lying about it

抢走我们的署名 赖掉我们的版税
so he doesn't have to give us the credit and the royalties that we deserve.

米莉...
Millie…

我找到了线索 是一段视频 它在一个玩家的储藏库里
I found a clue. It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

我只要你帮我一个忙 帮我溜进去
All I need from you is to get me in there.

米莉 我很在乎你...
Millie, I care about you…

但你真的得走了
but you need to leave.

今天会很不一样哦 小鱼鱼
Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

这是在看什么呢
What are we lookin' at?

你是谁
Who are you?

好了 冷静
Okay, okay. Okay.

我们之前在路上碰到过 你当时在哼那首流行金曲
We ran into each other the other day, you were humming that great song.

想起来了
Oh, yeah.

我还当你是非玩家角色 你怎么找到我的
I thought you were an NPC. How did you find me?

我一直在杀人火车那儿等你出现
I waited outside by the murder train,

然后跟着你过来的
then I followed you.

坏了
Shit!

我要跟你走吗
Should I come with you?

好的
Yes.

天哪 刚刚发生了什么
Holy hell, what just happened?

你还好意思问 你刚刚差点坏我大事儿
What just happened is you almost blew my mission.

我是问我们怎么从那儿一下子到了这个地方
No, I mean, how did we get from there to wherever this is?

你问传送枪吗
You mean the portal gun?

传送枪 听起来就很贵
Portal gun? That sounds expensive.

哇 你这个萌新还真是不一般
Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

谢谢 你也是
Thank you. You too.

转身
Turn around.

好的
Okay.

噢
Oh.

我们到北极了吗
Is this the North Pole?

听好了 大哥
Listen, dude.

-我叫盖 -盖 随便你叫什么
- Guy. - Guy. Whatever.

给你这身非玩家角色皮肤点个赞
Props on the NPC outfit,

但我现在要想办法偷个东西没空陪你
but I'm busy trying to figure out how to steal something.

也许我能帮你
Maybe I could help you.

我习惯单干
I work alone.

你的手榴弹真好看
You have beautiful grenades.

再说了 你要想在这个世界混出名堂
Besides, if you want to have any chance of making an impact here,

不提升一下你的等级可不行
you need to have a higher level than that.

-好紧 别碰 -不碰
- That's tough. No. - No.

提升等级
Higher level?

真是小白得可以
Good Lord, rook.

看见了吗
See?

这是我的等级
Oh. That's mine.

再看看你的
And that's yours.

噢... 1级是最高的还是最低的
Oh…  What, is one the best or the worst?

低得不能再低了
There is literally nothing lower.

那我要怎么样才能升级
Well, how do I get to a higher level?

-你真不懂 -真不懂
- Really? - Really.

-听好 拿到装备 -好
- You know, get stuff. - Yeah.

-你在跟我搞笑吗 -没有
- Are you kidding me right now? -Okay.

-拿经验值 拿枪... -好
- Experience, guns…  - Yeah.

-把枪放下 -好
- Put that down. - Uhhuh.

拿钱 在这里是自由城
Money. This is Free City.

你可以抢商店 抢别人车
You could rob a store, carjack someone,

随便殴打路人 你会弄明白的
punch a pedestrian in the face. You'll figure it out.

可我从不伤害无辜的人
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

不得不说 你这人还挺清新脱俗的
Hmm. I've got to admit that is kind of refreshing.

我还以为这里的人 个个都是行为幼稚的心理变态
Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet on here is a sociopathic manchild.

过奖了
Thank you.

不过这个世界也没你说的那么糟吧
Wait. But the world isn't that bad though, is it?

糟透了好吗
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

要是你见过掌管这个世界的混球
If you ever met the dick responsible for this world,

-你也会同意我说的 -你是说老天爷吗 你见过老天爷
- you'd agree. - Are we talking about God? You've met God?

他还是个混球
And he's a dick?

他叫安托万 对 绝对是个吃人不吐骨头的恶人
His name's Antwan, and yes, he's an absolute troll.

老天爷还吃人不吐骨头
Trolls exist?

听着 我不确定有没有人这么做过
Look, I don't know if anybody does it,

但你可以尝试通过做好人来赚经验值
but you could rack experience points up by being a good guy.

-当个英雄 -大哥 淡定
- Like a hero. - Ooh. Easy, tiger.

你要是不想杀人 可以偷别人的枪
If you don't wanna shoot people, you could steal their guns.

收集装备一样也能升级
All that shit makes your level go up.

去当个好人吧
Go be the good guy.

不对 我要当个盖世英雄
Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.

好吧 享受你一生的童贞吧
Okay, well, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

慢走不送
Off you go.

好的 等等 我要升到多少级才算够
Okay. Wait! How will I know that I've leveled up enough?

过了100级再来找我
Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk. Whoa.

-再见 -比1级高出好多
- Bye now. - That's so much more than one.

-还有99级... -再见
- It's like 99 more…  - Bye now.

好的
Okay.

你好
Hi.

谢谢 盖
Thanks, Guy.

What is this shirt?

上面的领子呢 下面的扣子呢
Where's your collar at? Where's the rest of the buttons?

衣角也不塞进裤子里 邋里邋遢
And it's not tucked in. You look sloppy.

你这样丑死了 你还练了肌肉吗
Matter of fact, you look horrible. Did you pick up some muscles, too?

还是别人给你打气了
Or is somebody outside pumping you up?

对不起 这么久没找你
I'm sorry that I haven't been around, Bud.

我在研究一些事情
I've been figuring some stuff out.

这宝贝改变了我的人生 它也会改变你的人生
These puppies changed my life. And they're gonna change yours, too.

别闹了 你知道我们不戴墨镜的

我只能帮你打开储藏库的大门
all I'm doing right now is opening the door.

如果这段视频真的能证明安托万盗用了我们的代码
If this clip really does prove that Antwan reused our code illegally,

你找到它就赶快出来
go find it and get out.

那个玩家正在市区做抢劫珠宝店的任务
Player's doing the jewelry store mission in midtown.

你有五分钟时间
That gives you 5 minutes.

行动吧
And go.

键盘 你真是个天才
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

是吗
Really?

我现在坐在马桶上 盗取用户密码
I'm sitting on the toilet right now, stealing user codes,

一点天才的感觉都没有
so I don't exactly feel like one.

你一向都没有
Oh, you never have.

好在我了解你
Good thing I know better.

说正事儿 你要找的视频在你左边的墙上
All right. The clip you're looking for should be on the wall to your left.

-谢谢你帮我 -不客气
- Thanks for the assist. - You got it.

希望里面有你要的证据

Keys! I need your help!

这是玩家利用守卫刷新点设的陷阱
He's got that place boobytrapped with spawn points.

米莉 我帮不了你
Millie, I can't help you.

蓝衣小哥
Blue Shirt Guy?

我换了亨利衫 我刚才酷吗 我感觉酷毙了
It's a Henley. Was that cool? It felt really cool.

你好美啊 这间屋子真高级
You look really pretty. Wow, this house is so nice.

What are you doing here?

本来是想偷个视频 现在只想保住小命
I was trying to steal a video clip, now we're trying not to die.

你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

那个穿非玩家角色皮肤的玩家
You know, that player in the NPC skin.

米莉 屋里没别的玩家
Millie, there are no other players in that house.

震得我手都麻了
That actually hurt my hand.

卧倒
Get down!

对不起 天哪
I'm sorry! Oh, God!

我们好有默契
We're doing great.

哇
Wow!

此地不宜久留
We should definitely go!

可恶
Oh, shit!

-你裤兜里是不是揣了把格洛克手枪 -不是
- Is that a Glock in your pocket? - No.

-不是？ -是两把格洛克
- What? - It's two Glocks.

这玩意儿貌似不会飞吧
I don't suppose this thing can fly.

不会
No.

跳车
Jump.

安托万来了
噢 见鬼
Oh, shit.

跟风狗们 早上好
Good morning, sheeple!

噢 你被开除了
Oh, you are fired.

游戏里的僵尸太血腥了 零售商可能不愿意卖
There is some concern with the bloody zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

那就去掉 当没事儿发生 下一个
Cut it. It's out. Never even happened. Next.

是您的律师 说要您的书面证词...
It's your lawyers. They need to get your deposition…

快说 你在说的是哪个官司
Speak. Which lawsuit are we talking about?

米莉 米莉·拉斯科 那没事儿了
Millie, Millie Rusk? No sweat.

这官司压根就上不了庭...
That will never see the inside of a courtroom…

她没证据 她的老搭档还在替我打工
because she's got no proof and her expartner works for me.

-我们稳着呢 -安托万
- We're golden. - Antwan,

你今天真有型
hey. You look great.

我以为你还在参加火人节
Uh, I thought you were still at Burning Man.

你看我像是还在参加火人节吗
Oh, does it look like I'm still at Burning Man?

你 你 你...
You, you, you…

不像 所以闭上你光有毛没有用的嘴听好
No. So, shut your stupid, bearded face and listen.

知道那个在游戏里到处乱跑穿得像非玩家角色的混蛋吗
You heard about the asshole running around in the game who looks like an NPC?

知道 我们叫他蓝衣小哥 我们会让他滚蛋的
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy. But we're gonna get rid of him.

谁要你让他滚蛋了 人人都爱他 社交媒体被他刷屏了
Don't get rid of him. People like him. It's all over social media. No.

我不但不让他滚蛋 还要把这个形象加进《自由城2》里
In fact, know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna use the skin in Free City 2.

画图的 给我搞个升级版的蓝衣小哥
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

多加点肌肉 做成杀手之类的
'Roid him out. Make him a hitman or something.

安托万 我们从《自由城1》迁移皮肤数据的进度已经慢了
Antwan, we're already way behind porting over the skins from Free City 1.

什么皮肤 管那干嘛
Skins? Don't even worry about that.

那些皮肤在《自由城2》根本用不了
They won't be usable in Free City 2.

安托万 你跟粉丝说过...
Antwan, you told the fans…

《自由城2》会向下兼容 广告也打了
Free City 2 is backwards compatible. It was in the commercial.

你说过续作会延用前作的角色
You said there'd be the same characters in the sequel.

那我告诉你 那些话 都是骗人哒
Well, here's the thing. When I said that, I was lying.

安托万 这游戏的问题越来越多
Listen, Antwan, the game is already buggier than ever.

每天要处理的投诉都堆成山了
I got a stack of user complaints, like a mile high.

我知道它问题很多
Look, I know it sucks.

但这个作品的知名度已经爆棚了 明白吗 你就别操心了
But the IP recognition is rock hard. Okay? So don't even worry about it.

我只是觉得我们可以做个原创游戏
I'm just saying, we could make an original game.

-什么 -做原创
- What? - Make an original?

为什么要做原创 续作它不香吗
Why would I do that when I could make a sequel?

续作真香
A sequel.

为了做到更好
So we can make it better?

爆款作品加续作 现在的人就买这个帐
IPs and sequels, that is the thing that people want.

-我问你一个问题 -行吧
- Let me ask you a question. - Okay.

你爱吃肯德基炸鸡 对吧
You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

-嗯  -不爱
Mmmhmm. No.

假如你爱吃肯德基炸鸡 而我是做肯德基炸鸡的
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken, and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

我也知道你爱吃肯德基炸鸡
and I know that you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,

那我干嘛还要开家新店卖什么
why would I make another restaurant called,

开封菜桶子鸡
uh, I don't know, "Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

-对吧 那我不是傻吗 -太傻了
- Okay? Makes no sense, homie. - Mmmhmm. No sense.

那我该卖你什么呢 续作 肯德基炸鸡系列 第二部
What am I gonna give you? A sequel. Kentucky Fried ChickenChicken, Part Two.

妙啊 续作永远的神
Uh, yum. Drop the deuce on him.

好啦 过来说
Come on. Come here. Come here.

我可不想为你这种事儿
I don't want you to stress

愁秃了一头秀发
that glorious shampoo commercial head of yours about it.

《自由城2》一定会火到祖坟冒青烟
Free City 2 is gonna be jumunjious.

这什么话
That's not a word.

你真的不想升去开发部吗？
You sure you don't wanna bump up to programming?

我知道你有那实力
I know you got the brains for it.

不了 谢谢 我在这儿挺好
No thanks. I'm good right where I am.

就喜欢你这样的 怕往高处走 虽然我不能理解
Love it. Fear of flying. Can't say I can relate.

不过 只要不用给你涨工资我都没意见
But all good with me if I don't have to pay you more.

安托万 闪人
Antwan out.

这家伙究竟是谁
Who is this guy?

我照你说的
I took your advice.

努力升级了
I leveled up.

让人刮目相看
Impressive.

你为什么要这么努力升级
Why are you doing all of this?

说不上来 我总感觉自己... 被困住了
You know, I guess I felt…  trapped.

感觉我的人生像是
You know, in my life.

我总感觉...
I just felt so…

停滞了
Stuck.

没错 然后你出现了
Yeah. And then I saw you.

你出现了
Then I saw you.

你是谁
Who are you?

我是盖
I'm Guy.

不 你的真实身份
No, who are you really?

就是盖
Still Guy.

你所做的这一切 你创纪录的升级速度
All of this, leveling up so fast.

给了全世界竖了一个大大的中指
Giving this whole world the finger.

你到底是怎么做到的
How are you pulling this off?

我这辈子从来没竖过别人中指
I've never given anyone any of my fingers.

你在苏乐美工作 对吗
You work at Soonami, don't you?

-不对 -你利用了工作上的便利
- No. - You've got an inside track.

-我在银行工作 -是吗 银行
- I work at the bank. - Right. The bank.

所以你是一个天才黑客 又恰好在银行工作
So, you're just this incredible hacker who happens to work at the bank.

对 我在银行工作
Yes, I work at the bank.

你哪儿来的这皮肤
Where did you get that skin?

它一直长在我身上
It's always sort of been there.

为什么总有人问我这个问题
Why do people keep asking me that question?

不知道 为什么呢
I don't know, why do they?

不是 我没有 我...
No, no. Not doing that. I…

现在是什么情况
What's happening right now?

不知道 但你骗不了我
I don't know, but I don't buy it.

好吧
No.

-好吧 当我没问 -好的
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it. - Fine. Good.

-不深究了 -很好
- I'll let it go. - Yes.

好极了
Great.

我们都有不能说的秘密
We all have our secrets, I guess.

是的 没错
Yes, we do.

我说
Hey.

你爱吃冰淇淋吗
Do you like ice cream?

这地方我居然从没来过
I can't believe I've never been here.

算是我的小秘密吧
Well, it's sort of a secret.

我跟我的好朋友巴迪经常来 这儿很安静又安全
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy, always come here. It's quiet and safe.

我知道为什么了
Yeah, it makes sense.

这里没任务可做
No missions here.

你一定要尝尝这个 你可能会觉得我很奇葩
Oh, you gotta try this. You're gonna think I'm crazy.

但我真的超爱这个口味
This is my favorite flavor in the whole world.

老样子 麻烦来两个
We'll take two of the usual, please.

好嘞 盖
You got it, Guy.

泡泡糖味冰淇淋
It's bubble gum flavor.

你是不是觉得我很奇葩
You think I'm crazy, don't you？

盖... 你是我肚子里的蛔虫吗 我超爱泡泡糖味冰淇淋
Guy…  Get out of my brain hole! I love bubble gum ice cream.

骗人 你是在嘲我吗
No, you don't. Are you making fun of me right now？

不是 大家都不喜欢泡泡糖味冰淇淋
No! Nobody likes bubble gum ice cream.

我喜欢
No, I do.

我有个前男友就是为了这个跟我掰的
I had a relationship end over bubble gum ice cream.

-不会吧 -真的
- No way. Here. - Yeah.

-干杯 -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

嗯
Mmm.

这有多棒啊
How good is that?

你能品尝到
You can taste it?

品尝到 就好像是我的舌头和日出生了个孩子
Taste it？ It's like my tongue had a baby with a sunrise.

-嗯哼 -嗯
- Mmmhmm? - Mmm.

我以前最爱喝咖啡
Coffee used to be my favorite food,

但跟它一比 咖啡就像刷锅水
but compared to this, it tastes like liquid suffering.

笑什么
What?

没什么 你很幽默
Nothing. You're funny.

-是吗 -对呀
- I am? - Yeah.

怪怪的幽默
Weird funny.

不过还挺戳我的
But that's kind of my speed.

怪怪的幽默也很戳我
Weird funny, that's totally my speed, too.

-真好 -对 我给你说个笑话吧
- Great. - Yeah. I know a joke.

一个怪怪的笑话 想听吗
A weird funny joke. You wanna hear it?

-说吧 -好的
- Please. - Okay.

一个基佬和一个残疾人试图谋杀一个非常小的孩子...
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair are trying to murder a very small child…

-跛子对那个同性恋说... -打住
- The cripple says to the homosexual… -Whoa. Stop, stop.

停 你从哪儿听到的
Stop! Where did you hear that？

一次抢劫案 持枪歹徒告诉司机的
A robbery. The gunman told it to the driver

都觉得这很搞笑 所以我把它记下来告诉了大家
who thought it was hilarious, so I memorized it and told everyone.

给个忠告
Word of advice？

别去学恶人们的笑话
Don't crib your jokes from the trolls of Free City.

恶人
Trolls?

那是秋千吗
Is that a swing set?

我的天...
Holy…

这也太离谱了
Okay, this is too weird.

我们都喜欢玛丽亚·凯莉的老歌 都喜欢泡泡糖味冰淇淋 现在都喜欢荡秋千
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice cream, and now swings?

-哪有这么凑巧的 - 我也是这么想的
- This is too weird. - I thought the same thing, too.

我也是
I thought the same thing.

我小时候特别喜欢荡秋千
When I was younger, I was obsessed with swings.

在我家人的眼里...
Growing up in my family, it was…

你不会想听的 算了
You don't wanna hear this. No.

你的事儿我都想听
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

在我家人的眼里 做到优秀还不够
Growing up in my family, it wasn't good enough to be great.

你必须成为第一名 这种 这种压力
You had to win, and that pressure, you know,

时时刻刻跟着你
it was just constant.

但只要我跑到院子里 坐上我的小秋千...
But when I was in the backyard on that little swing…

会有那么一霎那
You know that moment,

在秋千落下之前 身体挣脱重力的瞬间
that split second between rising and falling,

感觉自己自由了
when you're totally weightless, it feels like you're free.

恋爱了
In love.

自由 你说得对
Free. What you said. Yeah.

我好想吻你 这样奇怪吗
I really wanna kiss you. Is that weird?

你想吻我
You want to kiss me?

我想狠狠地吻你
I wanna kiss you so badly.

你想狠狠地吻我
You want to kiss me badly?

-是的 不是 -不是
- No! - No?

不是的 我想好好地吻你
No, no, no, no, no. I wanna kiss you well.

我就是太傻了
I mean, I'm an idiot,

所以有时会说傻话
so I say things like an idiot sometimes.

不 你不傻
No, you're not. You're not.

我是说
I mean, um,

要是你会操作 那就来吧
uh, if you know how to, go for it.

我会操作
I know how.

好的
Okay.

我来了
Here it goes.

这感觉比冰淇淋美妙多了
That was so much better than ice cream.

哇哦
Whoa!

好像有人在敲门
I think someone's at the door.

是啊
I'll say.

今天很开心
Well, this was great.

-是啊 -我们约个时间再见 好吗
- Yeah, it was. - Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

当然 一言为定
Yes. Definitely.

要不在现实世界里见
Maybe in the real world.

什么
What?

好 在哪儿都行 好的
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-好的 再见 -好的
- Okay. Bye. - Okay.

再见 燃烧瓶
Bye, Molotov.

那个... 我的真名叫米莉
Hey…  my real name is Millie.

我的真名还是叫盖
My real name continues to be Guy.

米莉 开门 米莉 是我 键盘 快开门
Millie, open up! Millie, it's me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

米莉 是我 快开门
Millie! It's me, open up!

-干嘛 -你说对了
- What? - You were right.

-你说对了 -那就请进吧
- You were right. - Oh, come on in.

你说得对 我们的代码在《自由城》里
You were right. Our code, it is in Free City

不仅如此 它成功了
and, Millie, it works.

我知道 可我们没有证据
Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.

先别管什么证据了
Just forget about that for one second.

我是说我们的游戏 《无限人生》
I'm saying that our game, Life Itself,

让游戏角色成长 改变 有血有肉...
where characters would grow and change and feel real…

-怎么了... -成功了
- Yeah?… - worked.

-键盘 -人工智能起作用了
- Keys. - The AI worked.

所以《自由城》才这么有真实感 大家才这么喜欢玩
It's the reason why Free City is so realistic and people love it so much.

当然 它不像《无限人生》
And of course it doesn't look the same.

没有瀑布 没有蝴蝶 没有独角兽
There's no waterfalls, there's no butterflies and unicorns,

所有角色的形象也都改了 这很正常
all the characters have different skins. Of course they do.

但《自由城》用的底层代码是同一个 就是我们的代码
But the underlying code in the game is the same. Our code.

盖 他的进化程度
And Guy, I mean, he has evolved way further

远超出我们的想象
than we thought was even possible.

等等 你说那个非玩家角色的黑客
Wait, are you talking about the hacker in the NPC skin?

米莉 我要告诉你一件事儿 那个蓝衣小哥...
Millie, I'm talking about the fact that Blue Shirt Guy…

怎么了
Yeah?

...他并不是个玩家
…is not a player.

他是通过算法生成的 而他以为自己是活人
He is an algorithm who thinks he's alive.

我是说 从理论上讲 他确实是活着的
I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.

他是史上第一个真正的人工智能
He is the first real artificial intelligence.

-不 -我懂
- No! No. - I know.

-不 这不是真的 -就是真的
- No, no, no. - Yeah, yeah.

-盖 我的盖 -对
- Guy? My Guy? - Guy.

-我还一直跟他... -你的盖
- One who has been…  - Your Guy?

-天哪... -这是好事儿啊
- Holy…  - This is a good thing.

不 一点也不好
No, it's really bad.

米莉 他的代码规模是原来的几千倍
Millie, his code, it's thousands of times the size it should be.

我们成功了 米莉
We did it, Mills.

我们成功了 我们想创造的东西真的实现了
We did it. Everything that we wanted to create, it actually happened.

明白吗 你知不知道非玩家角色有了自己的生活
Okay? Did you know that the NPCs have private lives?

有个咖啡师不断尝试学会了做卡布奇诺
One of the baristas learned how to make a cappuccino through trial and error.

你知道那有多难吗 连我都不会
I mean, that's really difficult. I can't even do that.

早上用燕麦奶打个奶泡我都打不来
I can't even froth my own oat milk in the morning.

还有 游戏里那个金发美女
And the Bombshell character in the game

她写了一本自传来毫不留情地抨击
wrote a memoir that's a searing indictment

父权制下的两性关系...
of gender roles, the patriarchy…

虽然部分内容有点说教 但总体都挺好
It's a little preachy in parts, but overall, it's pretty good.

米莉 我们应该庆祝一下
Millie, we have to celebrate!

-不 这不是真的 -你在说什么
- No, this can't be happening. - What are you talking about?

-这不是我们一直追求的吗 -我让他吻了我
- This is what we've been working for! - No, I let him kiss me!

就是这样
So, yeah.

等等 你在说啥 你让谁吻了你
I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?

盖
Guy.

盖
Guy?

我多少年来都没有和一个好男人接过吻了
The first time I kiss a nontoxic guy in like forever

结果他居然不是真人
and of course he's not even real!

呃 游戏里没有这个操作
Uh, there's not a button for that.

喔 他可会操作了
Oh, he found the button.

-打住 -好
- Okay. - Yeah.

我现在... 我现在非常懵
I am…  I'm so confused.

-怎么这么热 -甚至有些好奇
- Why is it so hot? - and surprisingly curious.

你让一个人工智能
You let an artificially intelligent

-游戏角色吻了你 -好吧
- video game character kiss you? - Oh, okay,

你别用这种口气行吗
can you just stop saying it like that?

你还觉得很...
And then you thought that would be…

见过他你就懂了
Because you have got to meet him, Keys.

他本人既风趣又体贴 还特别帅
He's funny, and he's sweet, and he's so handsome.

天哪 我居然真这么说了
Oh, my God, now I'm saying it out loud.

米莉 你好好想想 他现在才四岁左右
Also, Millie, food for thought, he's like four.

-真的吗 你给我来这套 -真的
- Really? You're gonna do that? - Really.

你把我说得好变态
Wow, you just made that really creepy.

米莉 糗事先不提 这项成果一旦公布
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or not, when people find out about this,

你说不定能得诺贝尔奖 天哪
you could win a Nobel Prize. Oh, God.

怎么了
What?

天哪 要是被他们发现了...
Oh, my God, if they see this…

被谁发现
What? What is it?

安托万 还能有谁
Antwan. What else?

这个骗子 他骗了我们的代码
He's lying. He lied about using our code,

还骗粉丝说续作能向下兼容
he's been lying about the game being backwards compatible.

《自由城1》的事儿估计也是骗人的
I think he's lying about Free City 1.

你到底在说什么
What are you talking about?

看见没 新任务 新场景...
Look. You see? There's not one mission, not one location…

一个《自由城1》的角色都没有
I mean, there's not even a single character from Free City 1 on here.

《自由城2》不是升级版本...
Free City 2 is not an update…

-是另起炉灶 -没错
- It's a replacement. - Exactly.

等下周一《自由城2》上线...
So when Free City 2 launches on Monday…

蓝衣小哥 盗用代码的证据 所有数据都会被删除
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code, everything will be deleted.

他不能那么做
He can't do that.

我们面对的可是人工生命 这太残忍了
I mean, this is artificial life we're dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

我们完了
We're screwed.

也许没完
Maybe not.

要是能在游戏里找到我们的原始场景
If we can find our original build in the game,

就能证明安托万盗用了我们的代码
it'll prove that Antwan used our code without properly licensing it.

要赶在《自由城2》上线之前找到
And we just have to find it before Free City 2 launches.

还剩48小时
We have 48 hours.

我找过了 你知道的
I've looked, Keys. You know I have.

我知道
I know you have.

但现在我们知道蓝衣小哥是谁了
But now that we both know about Blue Shirt Guy,

也许他能帮忙
maybe he can help?

那我就得告诉他真相
That would mean I'd have to tell him.

米莉 等续作一上线 他就不存在了
Millie, he's not gonna exist once the sequel launches.

他的世界就毁灭了
His whole world's about to end.

你觉得他会放过拯救世界的机会吗
Don't you think he'd want a chance to save it?

-拿好 -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

-不用谢 -盖
- You got it. - Guy?

盖 我有话跟你说
Guy, we need to talk.

你的声音怎么变了 怎么没有澳洲口音了
What's going on with your voice? Where's your Australian accent?

英国口音
British.

是不是澳洲口音我还是听得出的
I think I know an Australian accent when I see one.

我把口音特效关了
I turned off the accent filter.

这是我真正的声音
This is me.

好听
Good.

听着 我要跟你说一件很重要的事儿
Look, I have to tell you something really important.

你结婚了
Are you married?

没有
No.

天哪 吓我一跳
Oh, God.

还好不是 不然真感觉天要塌了
That would have been like the worst thing ever.

暂时还没塌
Maybe not the worst thing.

我带你看样东西
I have to show you something.

好
Okay.

哇哦
Wow!

我早就想进来看看了
I always wondered what was in here.

现在就点击“击杀回放”
Tune in to the Kill Cam

观看更多今日精彩时刻
for more of today's highlights

血流成河 子弹横飞 尽在自由城
of every bloody, bulletridden corner of Free City.

有谁见到过我家的猫了吗
Has anyone seen my cat?

嘿 是菲丽斯 她的猫总是走丢
Hey, that's Phyllis. She's always losing her cats.

这是乔伊 我认识他 他是我朋友
And there's Joe! He's my friend, I know that guy.

怎么回事儿 这儿是什么地方
I don't get it. What is this place?

我真不知道该怎么跟你说 这座城市是个游戏
There is no easy way to say this, but this city is a game.

我也不知道该怎么跟你说 但我知道这是个游戏
There's no easy way to say this, I know it's a game.

你教会了我怎么玩
You taught me how to play it. Boopboop.

没错 我教过你
Yes, you're right, I did.

但自由城不只是像一个游戏
But it's not just that it's like a game. It is a game.

它就是一个游戏 自由城就是一个电子游戏
It's a video game. And that's all it is.

这整个世界只是一个游戏
So the entire world is a game?

是的
Yes.

我们只是游戏里的玩家
And we're all just players in the game?

你只说对了一半
Not exactly.

我是玩家
I'm a player.

这里的人全都是玩家 我们都生活在现实世界里
All these people here are players. We live in the real world.

但你只能活在这里
But you only exist here.

所以你才永远没法离开自由城
It's why you can never leave Free City.

你是一个非玩家角色
You're what we call an NPC.

非玩家角色
NPC.

那个警察和那只有腹肌的兔子
The policeman and the muscular bunny rabbit,

他们也这么叫我 这是什么意思
they called me that. What is an NPC?

-我们来... -再来看一下积分榜
- Let's take… - Just watch.

所有人都给我趴在地上
Everybody get down on the ground!

谁都别逞英雄
Nobody try to be a hero.

很快会没事儿的
This will all be over soon.

我不明白
I don't understand.

你们都是非玩家角色
You're a nonplayer character.

-非什么... -游戏里的工具人
- Non…  - A background person.

你们的存在是为了让游戏更有趣
Someone designed to make the game more fun for real people.

等等 先停一下
Wait, hold on a second. Just stop for a second.

让我理一理你的话
I wanna make sure I'm getting this straight.

我再确认一下
I just wanna fully understand here.

你是说 我是假的
So, I'm fake?

这整个世界都是假的 我甚至连主角都不是
The entire world is fake? I'm not even a main character,

只是背景里的无脑工具人
I'm just this idiot who's in the background?

米莉 你为什么要说这些 我爱你
Millie, why are you even saying this? I love you.

你以为你爱我 因为你的程序是这么写的
You only think that because it's in your programming.

盖 你好好听我说
Guy, I need you to listen to me.

再过两天 这游戏就要永久关停了
In two days, the game is gonna shut down. For good.

等续作一上线 整个自由城
When this sequel launches, this whole city,

你 其他所有非玩家角色
you, all the people in it who aren't players,

都会永远消失 拜托你听我说
they'll be gone forever. You need to listen.

我一直感觉我的生活少了点什么
My whole life, I felt like there had to be something more.

然后你出现了
And then I saw you.

我就知道我一直以来的感觉是对的
And I knew I was right. I was right!

有那么一瞬间 我真的好幸福
And for a second, I felt amazing.

-我明白 -你根本不明白
- I know. - Except you don't know.

因为我们根本不一样
Because we're not the same.

你刚刚不就是这个意思吗
Isn't that what you said? You said that.

我们不一样
We're not the same.

你是真人
You're real.

那我呢 我是什么
And I'm what? I'm what?

你不是
You're not.

你不是
You're not.

就算我不是真人 但有那么一瞬间...
Well, I may not be real, but for a second there…

我真的有活着的感觉
I felt pretty alive.

这一切都是个谎言
It's all a lie!

周五前把季度报告交到我这儿
Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

还季度报告呢 行话倒是一套一套的
Quarterly reports. My, what specific business lingo.

在大城市生活 就像做梦一样
Wow. Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it.

直到生活把你击垮
Until it crushes your soul.

有谁见到过我的猫吗 有谁见到过我的猫吗...
Has anyone seen my cat? Has anyone seen my…

你的猫 没呢 菲丽斯 我没见过
Your cats? No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

但我可以给你个创新性建议… 把你家那扇破门关紧一点儿
But here's a revolutionary idea…  close your goddamn door.

猫又不会踩着别的猫叠罗汉
It's not like they're climbing on top of one another,

叠成一座猫猫塔 把你家门锁撬开
forming a little kitty tower, and then jimmying the locks.

猫没有大拇指 菲丽斯
They don't have thumbs, Phyllis.

没有大拇指
No thumbs!

你还不明白吗 你们都不明白吗
Don't you get it? Don't any of you get it?

这里的一切全都毫无意义 全都是假的 我们毫无意义
None of this matters! None of it! It's fake! We don't matter!

这座楼 是假的 这条街...
That building, that's fake! This street…

是假的
It's fake!

那辆车...
That car…

强尼警官
Officer Johnny!

祝你今天开心 盖
Have a good one, Guy.

噢 嘿 呃...
Oh, hey, uh…

进来吧
Come in.

这杯给你
Here you go.

谢谢
Thank you.

巴迪
Buddy,

如果你发现自己不是真人 你会怎么办
what would you do if you found out that you weren't real?

什么意思
What do you mean?

假设一下
Pretend with me.

好吧...
Okay, so…

那我能假设我是幽灵吗
Can I pretend I'm a ghost?

可以
Sure.

那我是现在这副模样 还是死了以后
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now? Or whenever I die?

穿着躺棺材的那种西装
Like, do I have a funeral outfit on?

-这不重要... -这身虽然是工作服
- This is kind of funeral…  - Doesn't matter.

...但也挺像西装的 因为有领带
…but even though it's a work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

我们跳过假设这部分好吗
Let's move on from the concept, okay?

好的
Got it.

我不是幽灵 虽然很失望
I'm not a ghost. I'm very disappointed,

-但我理解 -是啊
- but I get it. - Yeah.

我就是我 我就在这里 帮我的朋友排解烦恼
I'm me, who I am right now, and I'm just trying to help a friend.

那我觉得就算我不是真人那又怎样
I say, okay, so what if I'm not real?

你说什么 “那又怎样”
I'm sorry. "So what?"

对啊 那又怎样
Yeah. So what?

如果你不是真人
But if you're not real,

那不就等于你所做的一切都毫无意义吗
doesn't that mean that nothing you do matters?

这又是什么话 听着 兄弟 现在我就坐在这里
What does that mean? Look, brother, I am sitting here

陪着我最好的朋友 想法子帮他排忧解难
with my best friend, trying to help him get through a tough time.

对吧 即使我不是真人 但这一刻是真实的
Right? And even if I'm not real, this moment is.

此时此地 这一刻是真实的
Right here, right now. This moment is real.

帮助自己爱的人 还有什么比这更真实
I mean, what's more real than a person tryin' to help someone they love?

如果这都不算真实 那还有什么算真实
Now, if that's not real, I don't know what is.

你跟别的保安熟吗
Do you know the other security guards?

老熟了 干嘛问这个
I know 'em all. Why?

巴迪...
Hey, Buddy…

我们别错过今天...
let's not have a good day…

一起活出精彩吧
let's have a great day.

盖 我们来这儿干嘛
Guy, what are we doin' here?

来帮我朋友米莉找一段视频
We're here to get a video clip for my friend Millie.

这个姿势唬得住人吗
Does this look intimidating?

不知道 这玩意儿该怎么拿
I don't know, Guy. How do you hold this thing?

你手上有我要的东西
You have something I want.

乖乖交出来
And you're gonna hand it over.

你们怎么进来的
How'd you get in here?

很简单 我跟你的保安很熟
Easy. I know your security guard.

吉米
Jimmy?

人家叫路易吉
His name is Luigi.

你要是上点心记住他叫什么...
So if you took some time to learn his name…

没准儿他就不会果断出卖你了
maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick.

我来找一段视频 你最好乖乖交出来
I need a video clip, and you're gonna give it to me.

等一下 你是...
Wait a minute, are you…

你是蓝衣小哥
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

对 可能是吧
Yeah, maybe.

我去 你是那个小哥 蓝衣小哥 真是你
Holy shit! You're Guy! You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

-对 -我超爱你
- Yeah. - I love you.

-是吗 -我是说...
- You do? - I mean…

我是你的粉丝 你是我的偶像
I'm like a fan. You're awesome.

想要什么随便拿
You can have anything you want.

先等一下
Wait, hold on one second.

老铁们注意了 我是嗜血舞男
Gamers, listen up, this is Revenjamin Buttons here.

大名鼎鼎的蓝衣小哥来了
I'm here with Guy.

他来我的储藏库打劫我了
The Guy, he's in my stash house, and he's here to rob me.

这真是 你能不能...
Can I get a little…

-给我的粉丝表演一下你的问号脸 -什么
- "whatwhat" for my followers, Guy? - What?

太棒了 我给大家解释一下...
Perfect. All right, so what's happening is…

小哥在找一段视频...
Guy's looking for a clip…

是我演示怎么找到隐藏关卡的攻略
showing a walkthrough I did to get to the secret level.

你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

对不起
I'm sorry.

“你在跟谁说话” 这是盖的经典台词
Who am I talking to? It's just such a classic Guy line.

是吗？
Right?

你太棒了...
You're good. Oh, anyway…

说起来 你之前也来偷过一次 跟那个燃烧瓶小妞儿
And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick.

她叫米莉
Her name's Millie.

-是吗 等等 谁 -米莉
- Yeah. Wait, who? - Millie.

感觉很顺利啊
I think it's going really well.

是啊 这是我第一次把枪从枪套里拿出来
I know. This is literally the first time I took my gun out the holster.

你开心就好
Totally. Right?

我后来还想再去 但他们把漏洞修复了
Guy, I tried to go back through, but the glitch is patched.

我就再没找到过
And I never found it again.

只有我亲眼见过那个地方
So I'm the only one that ever saw what was on the other side.

但视频里都有 你自己看吧
But it's all here, check it out.

那地方还挺酷 像另一个世界
It's pretty cool actually. It's like a whole other world.

-这就是那段游戏视频 -是的
- This is it? This is the game clip? - Yeah, that's it.

你能不能再答应我一个请求
Can you do one, single, just one solid for me?

-这是最后一个 -好啊
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay? - Yeah.

说一下我的经典台词
Just say my catchphrase.

我的粉丝听了肯定会兴奋得香蕉奶油三明治洒一身
My viewers will just banana cream sandwich all over themselves if you say it.

我喜欢香蕉奶油三明治
I love banana cream sandwiches.

不是我说的香蕉奶油三明治吧
Maybe not this banana cream sandwich.

就是它
Yeah, this one.

你真逗 好 跟我说 现在是什么时间
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just say, "You know what time it is?"

-现在是什么时间 -现在是什么时间
- You know what time it is? - You know what time it is?

现在是什么时间
You know what time it is?

现在是什么时间
You know what time it is?

现在是什么时间
You know what time it is?

现在是什么时间
You know what time it is?

现在是什么时间
You know what time it is?

是犯罪时间 宝贝
It's crime o'clock, baby. Yeah.

是犯罪时...
It's crime o'cl…

不行 我说不了 这话有点儿...
But, no, I can't say that. That's…

好吧 没事儿 那我自己说 好的
Okay. It's all right. I'll say it myself.

-现在是什么时间 -不知道
- All right, you know what time it is? - No.

是犯罪时... 妈
It's crime o'cl…  Mom!

妈 你非得现在...
Mom! Are you serious with the…

用吸尘器吗
vacuum right now?

非得在这里用吗 我正在说...
You really have to do that here? I'm saying my…

经典台词 粉丝们都在看呢
catchphrase! Everybody's watching!

-老天爷 -你22岁
- God! - You're 22,

还在家啃老 可见老天爷不存在
living in my house, there is no God!

抱歉啊
Sorry, Guy.

谢谢你 舞男先生 我们差不多该走了
Thank you, Mr. Buttons. We're gonna go.

先别走 你们得杀了我
No, no, no! No, you gotta kill me.

-你说什么 -杀了我 求你了
- I'm sorry, what? - You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

人家好想要 满足我吧
Give it to me, Daddy. Give it to me!

不 我们不能 别这样好吗
No. Please don't do that. Please don't do that.

我们不会伤害任何人 我是好人
We're not gonna hurt anybody. I'm a good guy.

什么 你说什么
What? What'd you say?

你好深奥
That's deep.

不深
No, it's not.

仿佛深到灵魂深处
That's like I can taste you, deep.

帮帮我 巴迪 我怕刹不住这车
I want your help, Buddy. I don't have the safeword.

我知道你想要什么
I know what you want.

我真不想要
I don't want that.

你想要
Yeah, you do.

碰到了
That's touching.

-你碰到我了 -是啊
- They're touching. - Yeah.

我知道你想要什么
I know what you want.

我知道哦
Yes, I do.

你想看我跳自由城猫痒痒舞对吧
You want a little bit of that Free City Itchy Kitty.

-不对 -你想看
- No. - Uhhuh. Yes, you do.

你的动作 有点少儿不宜
The way you move, it's almost dirty.

要不要看我用灭霸的手套...
What about a little Thanos Glove…

给你们表演一个响指舞
into a little bit of Thanos Snap?

-你的手不疼吗 -好吧
- Oh. That looked like it hurt. - Yeah, a little bit.

那就换一个假日兜风舞
A little Sunday Drive.

你家很好看
You have a beautiful home.

-蛇男舞呢 不喜欢蛇舞 -再见 舞男先生
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man? - Bye, Mr. Buttons.

一起扭一个 给个面子
Come on, give me one snake! Just come on, man.

妈 不许动那只袜子
Mom! Do not touch that sock!

我把话放在这儿 你要敢动那只袜子...
I swear to God, if you touch that sock…

我就让你下半辈子都在医院里过
you will be in therapy for the rest of your life!

不 那只袜子是我的宝贝 你放下
No! That's my special sock! Put it down!

米莉 求你了
Millie, please.

醒醒 别像尊雕塑似的一动不动
Please wake up from your standing coma.

我知道这个世界对你来说只是个游戏
Look, I know this world is just a game to you

你能来去自如 可对我来说...
and you can come and go, but to me…

这座城市 这些人是我的全世界
this place, these people, that's all I have.

我想帮你一起拯救这个世界...
And if I can help you save it, I wanna do that…

但你得先醒过来 求你了
but you gotta wake up, please.

米莉 对不起 我不该扔下你走掉
Millie, I'm sorry for running away.

盖
Guy?

我差点被你吓死 对心脏太不友好了
Oh, that's so scary! It's just terrifying.

我知道
I know, I know.

对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

听着 也许你在游戏里的设定是工具人
Look, you may have started out living in the background,

其实现实里的我也一样 我们都受够了
but so did I. We're done with that.

我给你带了礼物
I got you a present.

还没来得及包装
I didn't have time to wrap it.

什么
What?

据说每年有超过十亿个非玩家角色被杀
They say over a billion NPCs are killed every year.

我得承认 这里面至少有一半是我杀的
Now, I'm not gonna lie, that's at least 50% my fault.

我以前喜欢把游戏里的路人杀个精光
I used to shoot all the secondary characters

闲得慌呗 你懂的
when I was bored, you know?

然后把他们装起来
And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit.

谁都不知道这个蓝衣小哥到底是谁
Who the hell even knows who this Blue Shirt Guy is?

但他让我开始思考
But I'll tell you this, he's got me thinkin'

该怎么看待非玩家角色 怎么玩游戏
about NPCs and how I play the game.

这游戏就不是做给他这种人玩的 不是让你当好人的
The game wasn't even made for someone like this, for a player to be a good guy.

蓝衣小哥还很可爱
He's also a really cute guy.

不光是脸 他整个人就是一个大可爱
And not just the face, you know, like the whole thing.

而且 他让我意识到...
And, honestly, it's got me realizing…

我们对非玩家角色的看法也许一直以来都是错的
maybe we've been thinking about NPCs wrong this whole time.

我觉得蓝衣小哥是一种象征
I think Blue Shirt Guy's like a symbol, you know?

也许我们可以活成自己梦想的样子
Like, maybe people can be whatever they want.

他像是一个偶像 是这么说的吗
He's like an icon. Is that the right word?

他告诉我们人生有无限可能
Like, he reminds us of what's possible.

而且他现在非常火爆
Also, he's like crazy hot.

我的天哪 我居然那么用力打这些人
Oh, my God, totally. I'd hit those pixels hard.

我们应该向蓝衣小哥学习
We should all be more like Blue Shirt Guy.

也许我们应该停止杀戮了
Maybe we just stop the killing.

他死定了 听到了吗
He's dead! You hear me?

把他的画面调出来
The guy, put him up here.

打在大屏幕上
Put him up here on the screen. Put him on the screen.

让我好好看看他 就是他
Make me see him. There he is.

好啊 看看他干的滥好事儿
Yes. There he is, the little dogooder.

你不是喜欢蓝衣小哥吗
I thought you liked Blue Shirt.

别跟我说话
Don't say words to me!

现在人们都忙着看他耍猴儿
People are so busy watching this loser on Twitch and YouTube.

知道什么结果吗
You know what they're not doing, guys?

《自由城2》没人买了
Buying Free City 2.

-预售跌了16个百分点 -是60个
- Presales are down 16%. - 60.

60个 要老命了
60. That's bad.

再过48个小时就要上线了
Oh, we are 48 hours from launch.

他成顶流了
Yeah, he's gone viral.

是啊 让我的心情极度郁闷的毒瘤
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass and ball cancer at the same time!

没治的毒瘤
Inoperable!

这种扮好人的风气对游戏影响很不好...
You know, this whole good guy routine…

对拉分销也很不好 让他给我滚蛋
it is a bad influence, and is bad for the franchise.

我不管他是谁 把他踢出去
I want him gone. I don't care who it is, boot him.

你踢不了
You can't.

你再说一遍
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

你踢不了
You can't.

为什么
Why not?

因为他不是黑客 他是非玩家角色
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan. He's an NPC.

你不会是要说
You're tryin' to tell me that all this shit

非玩家角色有自我意识了那种屁话吧
about a selfaware NPC is real?

对 我也不知道为什么 但他就是活了
Yeah. I don't know how or why, but he's real.

我要怎么办 我要怎么办
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

好的 好的
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

想一想 怎么办 想到了
What to do? What to do? Got it.

鲤鱼打挺
And kipup!

我挺
up!

我们不能把他踢出游戏
So we can't kick him out of the game.

那能让他的人工智能重置吗
How do we reset his AI?

大家开动脑筋 快点儿 出出点子
Ideas, people. Come on. Hit me. Ideas.

可以直接重启服务器
You could just reboot the server.

继续说
Keep talking.

只要重启服务器...
If we reboot the server…

他就会变回原来那个普通的非玩家角色
then he's just gonna revert back to a regular nonplayer guy.

-蛇皮操作 -安托万
- Solution. - Antwan.

安托万 你这么做是在终结...
Antwan, you're talking about terminating…

史上第一个被证实的人工智能生命体
the first confirmed artificially intelligent life-form right now, okay?

老弟 别激动
Honey, honey. Shush.

他在害我赔钱
He's losing me money.

今天就算他是达斯·维达跟施瓦辛格合体
So, I don't care if he's ArnoldFrickin'SchwarzenVader.

我也照样终结他 重启
Terminate him. Reboot.

-这就去办 -你不能这么做
- On it. - You can't do that.

重启
Reboot!

现在就来一份大杯谋杀鸡尾酒... 满足你内心深处的嗜血欲望
Order up and drown your bloodlust… with a tall glass of murder juice.

下面是本周精彩时刻
Here's this week's highlights.

他的肢体语言很丰富
He's very expressive with his body.

看得出
Clearly.

那是什么
What is that?

像是另一个世界
It's a whole new world over there.

有点像乐园仙境之类的
Some kinda paradise and shit.

天哪 就是这个
Oh, my God, that's it.

这是我们的原始场景 它能证明这个游戏用了我们的代码
It's our original build and that build is proof our code is in the game.

你不知道我找它找了多久
You have no idea how long I've waited for this.

我见过这个地方
I've seen this place.

什么
What?

真的
Yeah.

什么意思 你怎么可能见过
What do you mean? How could you have possibly seen it?

米莉 米莉
Millie? Millie?

关掉了 《自由城》下线了
We're dark. Free City is offline.

怎么回事儿
What is happening?

再见啦 蓝衣小哥
Byebye, Blue Shirt.

不
No, no, no.

重启中
行了
It's okay. Come on.

不是吧
Come on.

快点儿呀
Come on, come on, come on.

早安 小鱼鱼
Good morning, Goldie.

今天有温暖干燥的枪林弹雨...
Front of warm, dry gunfire…

午后有时有捅人...
mixed with late afternoon stabbings…

周二傍晚出行...
could leave you in the streets wet with the blood of innocents…

可能会被路人的鲜血溅湿衣服
by early Tuesday night.

浅度烘焙和深度烘焙到底有什么区别
What really is the difference between a light roast and a dark roast?

谁知道
Nobody knows.

别错过今天 要活出精彩
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

盖 能借一步说话吗
Guy, can we talk?

戴墨镜的妹子怎么知道你的名字
How does the sunglass girl know your name?

不知道 我们快走
I don't know. Keep walking.

快想起来 盖 你认识我
Come on, Guy! You know me.

还有这个
You know this.

你说你见过视频里的地方
You said this clip showed a place you'd seen before.

你得告诉我是哪儿
I need to know where.

数据被删除了 但你一定还有记忆
The data's been erased, but it's in your head.

求你好好想一想 这真的很重要
Please try to remember. This is really important.

求你了 盖 回忆一下 冰淇淋 荡秋千
Please, Guy, think. The ice cream, the swings?

我兄弟可喜欢荡秋千了
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

自由城港口公园里就有一架很棒的秋千
At Free City Harbor Park, there's a great swing set there.

-你去过吗 -去过
- Have you been? - Yes.

我们还吃了泡泡糖味冰淇淋
We had bubble gum ice cream.

天哪 我爱泡泡糖味冰淇淋
OMG, I love bubble gum ice cream!

他超爱泡泡糖味冰淇淋
He loves the bubble gum ice cream.

我知道 我们一起吃的 记得吗
Yes, I know. We had it together, remember?

拜托了 盖 我就指望你了
Please, Guy, you're all I've got.

对不起 小姐 我想你认错人了
I'm sorry, lady. I think you have the wrong guy.

别错过今天 要活出精彩
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

喂
Hello?

我有发现了
I might've found something.

我查了盖的代码 发现有些数据...
I've been going through Guy's code and there is something there…

现在还存在 没有被删掉
even now, after the wipe.

那有什么用
What's the point?

盖是无法复制的奇迹 十亿个里才出一个
Guy was, like, a oneinabillion miracle. We can't replicate that.

我已经试过了 我们这次是真完了
I tried, okay? You were right, it's over.

不 米莉 你没懂我的意思
No, Millie, Millie, you're not listening to me, all right?

重启 不会删除他的人工智能代码...
A reboot, it doesn't erase his AI coding…

只有服务器本体坏了才会
you literally would have to destroy the servers to do that.

他的人工智能还在 只是需要存取记录
His AI is still there, it just needs to be accessed.

我去找过他了 键盘 他全都忘了
I've seen him, Keys. He's forgotten everything.

看我发给你的跟踪日志
Just look at the trace log I sent you.

看了你就明白了
It'll explain everything.

从一开始...
Now, from the beginning…

盖的行为就比预设复杂得多
Guy's behavior is much more complex than it should be,

我们的代码就是这么牛
thanks to our code.

可他被困在自由城里 日复一日重复同样的生活
But he's still stuck in Free City. He's still stuck in this life, this loop.

然后 有什么变了 他活了过来 为什么会这样
And then, something changes. He comes to life. Why?

然后我想到
And then I remembered.

《无限人生》里有个角色 我管他叫“单相思”
One of the characters from Life Itself was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.

他的人物设定就是永远遇不到真爱
And he was someone who was designed to never meet the right person.

这是这个角色的基础设定
It was essentially the building blocks of the character.

可他还是一直盼着遇见“他的梦中情人”
But he never stopped hoping that he would meet "the girl of his dreams."

要设计这个梦中情人我得找个模特...
So I had to base this girl off of someone…

最好的模特就是那个每天坐在我边上的人
and who better than the person that I was sitting next to every day?

你
You.

结果 有一天...
But then, one day…

他在自由城里遇见了你 你的出现...
he meets you in Free City, and once he sees you…

让他发生了质的改变
he can never be the same.

他本该心如死灰 但突然间 他有了活着的感觉...
He was supposed to feel doomed, but instead, he feels alive…

到最后 他真的活了
until eventually, he is alive.

米莉 你改变了他
You changed him, Millie.

你改写了他的代码 我相信你一定能再办到
You changed his code. And I think you can do it again.

米莉 是你给了他生命
You brought him to life, Millie.

是你让他活过来了
You brought him to life.

他能活过来是因为他遇见了...
And he was alive because he met the one person…

别错过今天...
Don't have a good day…

要活出精彩
have a great day.

谢谢
Thank you.

慢走
Take care.

所有人都给我趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

谁都别逞英雄 很快会没事儿的
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

好的
Okay.

所有人里不包括你
Everybody except you.

小心 门 我开了
Door, door, door. I got it.

女侠饶命 我还有小金鱼要养
Please, I have a goldfish.

我没多少时间
Look, I don't have long.

我抓了你当人质 要被贴三个暴行徽章
I just took you hostage, so there are three badges on me.

徽章 是童子军徽章还是什么
Badges? Is that like a Girl Scout thing? What is that?

你的身体里有一种特别的东西
There is something inside you, Guy.

什么 我不想身体里有东西
What? I don't want anything inside of me.

他们把你困在银行里...
They stuck you in that bank and…

按他们制定的规则...
expected you to just follow the rules…

-我喜欢银行 -天天做同样的事情
- I love the bank. - and do the same thing every day.

但你可以做到更多
You are so much more than that.

我不想做到更多
I don't wanna be more than that.

你必须给我想起来
No, and I need you to remember it.

为什么知道我叫什么 你为什么一直跟着我
Why have you been following me and how do you know my name?

戴上
Put these on.

你不能逼我做我不想做的事儿
I don't have to do anything that I don't wanna do.

对 选择权完全在你自己手里
True. The choice is totally yours.

我戴 我戴还不行吗
Okay. Okay. Fine.

那是什么
What is that?

这眼镜是什么 魔术道具吗
What are these? Trick glasses or something?

仔细听好
Listen carefully.

再过24小时 这个世界 所有你认识的人
In 24 hours, this world, everyone you know,

都会永远消失
it's all gonna disappear for good.

求求你放我走吧
Can you please just let me go?

其实我没看清你的脸
I mean, I haven't really even seen your face.

只看到个轮廓
I mean, I've seen the general area,

但我表达能力很差
but I'm not really good with descriptive words.

我连话都说不清楚
Not really good with words in general.

-不管了 -什么
- Screw it. - What? Oh!

我想起来了
I remember.

欢迎回来
Welcome back.

不是 我全部都想起来了
No. I remember everything.

跟我来
Come with me.

我天天这么做成了习惯 都忘记理由了
I do this every day so much, I'd forgotten why.

看到了吗
Do you see that?

窗叶上
Right there.

天哪
Oh, my God.

天哪
Oh, my God!

安托万把我们的场景藏在地平线背后...
Antwan hid our original build past the horizon, making it invisible…

但他忘了去除反射的倒影
but he forgot to scrub the reflections.

它就在那儿 只是我们看不见而已
It's still out there, Guy. We just can't see it.

只要能到那儿我们就有证据了
If we can get there, that is the evidence we need.

走到海边就会被拦住 我试过
You can't go past the water line. I tried.

我们找人帮忙
We need help.

亏安托万想得出把原始场景藏在一个
Antwan found a way to hide it in plain sight

远在天边近在眼前却没人到得了的地方
in the one place no one can even get to.

凭他的智商
I can't even believe

居然能想出这么恶毒的点子
he's smart enough to be this diabolical.

键盘 专心干正事儿
Keys, I need you to focus.

好吧 从倒影看场景就在南边地平线背后
Okay. So, the reflection shows the build past the southern horizon.

但游戏的物理引擎不允许你走进海里
But the game physics won't allow you past the beach.

你能想办法让我们穿过碰撞网格体吗
But you think you can find a way to get us past the collision mesh?

那得搭一座桥
We're gonna need a bridge.

你去杀手海滩 剩下的交给我
You just get to Hitman's Beach and I'll figure out the rest.

米莉
And, Millie?

千万小心
Be careful.

安托万是个混蛋可他不傻
Antwan may be an asshole, but he's not stupid.

他迟早会发现你的目的然后用尽一切手段来阻止你
He'll figure out what you're up to and he'll throw everything he's got at you.

你说得对
You're right.

嗨 米莉 还有那位我看不见的人...
Um, hi, Millie, and other person I can't see…

我有个想法
well, I have an idea.

我们能不能让他没有手段可用
What if he has nothing to throw?

大家过来 集中一下
Everyone! Gather around!

谢谢你们能来
Thank you for coming.

你们都认识我了 我是盖
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

嗨 盖
Hi, Guy.

嗨
Hi.

我下面要说的事儿可能不太好理解
What I'm about to say may be hard to understand.

非常难以理解
Really hard to understand.

但我想问 你们是不是讨厌不被重视地活着
But, are you sick of living in the background?

讨厌被枪打成筛子
Aren't you sick of being shot at?

受够了
Enough.

-被人挟持 -烦透了
- Taken hostage? - No more.

-被车撞 -我们不想再这样了
- Run over? - We done with that.

被抢 被捅 被当成人肉盾牌
Robbed? Stabbed? Used as a human shield?

我们不想再被捅了
We are tired of being stabbed!

-巴迪 -抱歉
- Buddy! - Sorry.

你到底想说什么 盖
What are you trying to say, Guy?

我想说的是 自由城可以不是这样
I'm tryin' to say that things in this city don't have to be this way.

生活可以很不同
Things can be different.

怎么个不同法
Different how?

-首先 你可以把手放下来 -对
- For starters, you can put your arms down. - Yeah.

放下来 你能做到 很好
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

继续放 好样的
Keep pushing. There you go.

加油 深呼吸
Breathe through it. There you go.

加油 加油
Do it. Do it. Do it.

-不行 好吧 -就是这样
- No, not gonna happen. - Nope.

感觉太别扭了
That feels unnatural.

万一突然来个拿枪的人呢
I mean, what about when someone runs in with a gun?

还是这样一直举着比较省事儿
Having my arms up is just a real time saver.

但要是拿枪的人再也不来了呢
Except, what if the guy with the gun doesn't come?

-什么 -真的吗
- What? - What?

总有拿枪的人
There's always a guy with a gun.

满大街都是拿枪的人
So many guys with guns.

要是我们的世界可以不必这样充满恐惧
People, what if our world doesn't have to be so scary?

要是我们可以改变它呢
What if we can change it?

米莉 在你们的世界一天会发生几次银行抢劫
Millie! How many times a day are the banks robbed in your world?

几乎不会发生 盖
Hardly ever, Guy.

那尸体呢
What about corpses, Millie?

-什么 -你会见到许多尸体吗
- What? - You see a lot of those?

一小时能见到几具
How many an hour?

一具都见不到 盖
None per hour, Guy.

那么枪支暴力呢
What about gun violence?

你们的世界有枪支暴力吗
See a lot of gun violence in your world?

这是个很大的问题 盖 这是个很大的问题
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy. It's a massive problem.

你这个回答我可没想到
I didn't see that coming.

这是真的 太糟糕了
It's true. It really sucks.

重点是 我们不必做生活的旁观者
The point is, we don't have to be spectators to our own lives.

我们可以活成自己梦想的样子
We can be whatever we want.

我们成不了你这样 盖
We can't all be you, Guy.

你错了
That's not true.

你的身体里 跟我有同样的东西
What's inside of me is inside of you, too.

什么
What?

你们每一个人的身体里都有 你们都在成长
It's inside of each and every one of you. You're growing.

我不想每天只做滴滤咖啡 我想要做…
I need more in my life than drip coffee. I want to make…

卡布奇诺
A cappuccino.

作出一番惊天动地的成就
A goddamn difference in the world.

这个更加好
Much, much better.

我还要做珍珠奶茶
And a green tea boba.

-天哪 -我决定了
- Holy shit! - That's right!

放手去做吧
You go, girl.

你真了不起
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

只要我能越过这片海...
If I could just make it out past that water…

海的那边有一个自由的世界
there's a world out there where we can be free.

我们可以决定自己的人生
Where we get to decide who we wanna be.

自己的价值 我们必须据理力争
Where we can matter. But we have to fight for it.

团结一致 共同奋战
We have to fight together.

说得好
Yeah!

一直以来你们都在按别人的想法活着
You guys have always done what's expected of you.

这种鬼日子今天到头了
But that shit ends today.

没错
Yeah!

虽然不知道发生了什么
I don't even know what's happening right now!

但我喜欢
But I love it!

太好了 我喜欢
I love it!

我喜欢
I love it!

我也是 大家都过来
I love it, too! Come on, guys, get in here!

靠拢点儿 听我说一下计划 大家都来
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do! Everyone in!

所有人都给我趴在地上
Everybody get down on the ground!

人呢
Hello?

人都死哪儿去了
Where the hell is everybody?

出来
Hello?

非玩家角色怎么都不见了
Where are all the NPCs?

我玩《自由城》差不多三年了
Look, I've been playing Free City for, like, three years now.

从没遇到过这种情况
I've never seen anything like this.

直到最近 我才注意到有非玩家角色不见了
Up until recently, I don't even know if I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.

但按传言所说...
And I don't know if this is just some whack Reddit theory…

蓝衣小哥压根不是玩家
but some people are saying that Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.

-他其实是人工智能 -人工智能
- That he's actual AI. - AI?

实打实的人工智能 意思就是活的
Actual AI. You know, alive.

这就是为什么蓝衣小哥能火遍全网
It's why Blue Shirt Guy is trending everywhere.

安托万 如果你在看直播 求求你快把游戏修好
Antwan, if you're watching this, please fix the game.

-最重要的是 一定要让蓝衣小哥回来 -天哪
- And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt. - Oh, my God. My God!

安托万 你快看这个
Antwan, you should see this.

你之前也来偷过一次 跟那个燃烧瓶小妞儿
And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick.

-她叫米莉 -谁
- Her name's Millie. - Who?

米莉
Millie.

逮到她了 逮到你们俩了
Got her. Got her! Got you! Got you!

鼠标 让我看看他在哪儿 快点儿
Mouser! Put him up on the screen. Now. Put him up.

没错 快点儿
That's it. Come on, quicker.

有了 在这儿呢
Yes, there he is.

他开着车跟一个叫燃烧瓶女孩儿的玩家在自由城里兜风呢
He's joyriding around Free City with some player called Molotovgirl.

她的真名叫 米莉·拉斯科
AKA Millie Rusk.

米莉·拉斯科 不是键盘的老搭档吗
Millie Rusk? Isn't that Keys' old partner?

没错
Yeah.

还是一个为了从我这儿讹钱...
Also the one who's trying to hit me with this bogus lawsuit…

编了个谎话诬告我的疯婆娘
'cause she's desperate for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

马上把燃烧瓶女孩儿踢出去
Boot Molotovgirl now.

我在试 能试的办法我都试了 但她的帐号是假的
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can, but her account's spoofed.

这女的不是一般的牛
This woman is exceptional.

那就在游戏里把她杀了
Then kill her in the game.

“什么” 你没听错 杀了她
"What?" Yes, I said that. Kill her.

动用所有手段收拾他们 给她贴五个暴行徽章
Throw everything at them, all right? Five badges, G.

好 但是有个问题
Yeah, just one problem.

我们什么手段都没有
We don't have anything.

你说啥呢 大哥
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

我们没有任何防御力量
We don't have any defenses.

不管是警察还是军队 都用不了
We don't have police, military, no nothing.

我刚才就想跟你说
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

好像所有非玩家角色都罢工了
It's like every NPC went on strike.

大杯抹茶拿铁 加双倍燕麦奶加肉桂粉
Got a tall, halfcaf, double foam oat milk,

减咖啡因 好了
matcha latte with cinnamon!

-是我的 -给
- That's me. - Hey.

-谢谢 -不用谢
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

干杯
Cheers.

加油 给他们点颜色看看 盖
Go get 'em, Guy!

像是一场突如其来的数字罢工
It's like a digital walkout.

才怪
No, it's not.

他们绝对是有计划有预谋的
They're doing this on purpose, it's part of their plan.

我给你支个招 把他们都杀掉
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna kill them in the game.

把复活关了 马上把他们杀掉
Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now.

但那样玩家的角色也没法复活了
But that means any players who die will be done for good.

他们会骂街的
They'll freak out.

关老子屁事儿
I don't care.

老板 我想确认一下 你的意思是说我们要放大招了吗
Sir? Sir, just to be clear, are you telling me that it's go time?

你这是想要跟我幽一默
Are you looking for some sort of banter thing

因为你觉着咱们现在...
'cause you think we're friends now…

成好朋友好兄弟了是吗
and we're in some sort of gang together?

是的 我就是这么想的
Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for.

行啊 做搭档 太好了
Cool, we're a team.

我们想一个口号吧
We should come up with a catchphrase, okay?

好啊
All right.

-数到三 一起说... -一 二 三...
- On three. One, two, three…  - One, two, three…

给我干活去
Get back to work!

谁给我把键盘找来
Someone find me Keys!

各位 老板发话了 放大招了
All right, people, you heard him. It's go time!

看起来不太妙
Okay, that's not good.

他知道我们要去哪儿了
He knows where we're going.

我来对付他 他绝对跑不了
All right, I got him. I got him. Don't worry.

想被轮胎打脸吗
Want some four wheels to the face?

接招 砰
Take that. Boom!

兔子叔叔来抓你喽 咱可是顶级掠食者
Rabbit's coming for you. Apex predator.

哇
Whoa!

好极了 你们看到了吗
Here we go. Y'all watching this?

看我怎么了结这蠢货
I'm about to end this fool.

快点儿
Come on, come on, come on.

键盘 你在的话拜托帮个忙
Keys, if you're there, a little help, please.

我去 是谁干的 是谁在捣乱
God! Okay, who did that? Who is doing that?

少跟我玩阴的 听见没 我现在已经压力爆表了
Don't play with me! Seriously! I'm under way too much pressure!

冲啊
Come on!

冲过去
Go, go, go!

我问了保安 键盘没离开公司大楼
I just checked with security. Keys hasn't left the building.

听你这意思就是没撤了呗
Oh, sounds like you've done everything possible.

准备放弃不想找了是吗
Time to give up? You wanna give up?

不是 我感觉你想要我继续找
No, I'm sensing you want me to keep looking.

-快去 -我马上回来
- Go. - I'll be back.

也不知道这俩蠢货想跑哪儿去
I have no idea where these fools are running to.

我知道 南部海岸 杀手海滩
I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach.

他们傻吗 那儿除了海什么都没有
Well, that's stupid. There's nothing out there but water.

游戏物理引擎也不允许他们越过海岸线
Game physics won't even let you get past the shoreline.

除非海上真有什么东西
Unless there is something out there.

安托万 海上有东西吗
Antwan, is there something there?

不管了 画图的
Screw it. Art nerds.

放大佬
Time for Dude.

我们还在改进
We're still working on him.

他是我亲自设计的 不需要改进
I worked on him myself. He's perfect.

立刻让他上线
Drop in Dude now.

照办吧 虽然现在他就像个白痴...
Just do it. He's got, like, half a brain…

程序也没写好 但是不管了 上传吧
he's barely written, but sure, start the upload.

接下来怎么办
What are we supposed to do now?

等键盘帮我们搭桥
Now Keys finds us a bridge.

来回收你插在我背上的刀子吗 老弟
Come to collect those knives you stabbed in my back, bro?

你一直在偷偷地帮米莉·拉斯科
You've been helping Millie Rusk this whole time.

帮她找你们的场景
She's looking for your build.

你说什么场景 安托万
What build, Antwan?

你的游戏又没用我们的代码
It's not like you used our code anyway, right?

既然没用我们的代码...
And if you didn't use our code…

游戏里又怎么会有我们的场景呢 对吧
then how can our original build be in the game, right?

还是有什么我不知道的
Or am I missing something?

你们出去
Leave us.

键盘 我们好好聊聊
Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk.

你那破游戏就算我发行了 也会暴死
If I'd put out your dumb game, it would have bombed.

你怎么知道一定会失败
Antwan, you don't know it would've failed.

我就是知道
Yeah, I do know.

我看过数字 统调 小组调研
I looked at the numbers, the tracking, the focus groups.

你就没想过有些东西比数字更重要吗
Has it ever occurred to you that some things matter more than numbers?

什么东西能比数字还重要 钱吗
What matters more than numbers? Money?

告诉你个热知识 钱也是数字
Yo, news flash, bro, money is still numbers.

除了数字什么都不重要
Nothing matters more than numbers!

你该感谢我才对
You should be thanking me!

我该感谢你
I should be thanking you?

你赚了那么多钱 靠的是我们的心血
What about the profits that you got from our work?

你已经选了跟着我 绝地学徒
You chose your side, little Padawan.

现在是你向帕皇表忠心的时候了
And now, it's time for you to take your place next to the Emperor.

你明白吗 老弟
You get me, bro?

我明白了… 老哥
Yeah, I get you…  bro.

那也只有这样
Which leads me to this.

谢了 键盘
Thanks, Keys.

这是哪一出
What the hell was that?

安托万 大事儿不好了
Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic.

没想到你居然这么糊涂 键盘
Oh, I thought you were smarter than this, Keys.

你可以收拾铺盖滚蛋了
You're obviously fired, you know that.

我问你 她为什么还在游戏里
And you, what is she still doing in the game, man?

踢掉所有人
Boot everyone.

等等 你要把玩家也全部踢掉
Hold up. You want me to boot all the players?

马上把游戏里的人都踢掉
Boot them out of the game, now!

注销所有玩家的账号
Cancel every player account!

大佬怎么还没上线
And where the hell is Dude?

保安 把这废物轰出去
Security! Kick this punk out.

盖
Guy!

-米莉 -我要被踢出去了
- Millie! - They're taking me out.

怎么回事儿
What's happening?

就靠你了 大家都在看你
It's on you now. Everybody's watching.

继续前进
You gotta keep going.

等等 我还能见到你吗
Wait, wait, wait! Will I see you again?

只要你能到达桥的那头
You will if you make it across that bridge.

让全世界看到我们的原始场景
Show the whole world our build. That's the proof.

证明安托万盗用了代码 那样他就完了
You do that, Antwan is done.

我会的
I'll make it.

一定会
I'll make it.

什么鬼
What the hell?

什么情况
What's going on?

好了 让我们都记住这一刻 在我们被解雇之前
All right, let's all remember this moment, before we were fired.

经典台词
Catchphrase.

经典台词
Catchphrase?

我还没来得及想好
What? I haven't had time to think one up yet.

不过“经典台词”本身就是一句相当经典的经典台词
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase is a pretty cool catchphrase.

加油 盖 站起来
Get up, Guy. Get up.

不是吧
Oh, no, no, no.

盖 我来救你了
Guy, I came to save you.

-他是谁 -我不认识
- Who is this? - I don't know.

他好雄壮
He's glorious.

他长得像你...
I mean, he's just like you…

但比你雄壮
but way better.

雄壮一万倍
Way, way better.

-谢谢 -我没在夸你
- Thank you. - No, that's not a compliment.

你最好别碰他 巴迪
I wouldn't touch him if I were you, Buddy.

为什么不能碰
What do you mean you don't think I should touch him?

你不介意的 对吧
You don't mind this, do you?

因为我也是你的好兄弟
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

因为他可能会... 揍你
Yeah, I think he's gonna…  hit you.

他的拳头好狠
He punches so hard.

可他的手好软
But yet his hands are so soft.

-要坚强 好的 -再见
- Be strong. - Okay, bye.

他举我像举一根羽毛
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

不要啊
No, no, no! No!

站起来 加油
Get up, Guy, get up!

游戏结束 经典台词
Playtime's over. Catchphrase.

我听不懂你说什么
I don't know what that means.

加把劲儿 站起来
Come on, man. Get up!

快起来
Get up.

我这辈子最爱干的事情有三件
There are three things I love in life.

海扁人 待定 输入第三件事
Kickin' ass, TBD, third thing here.

天哪
Oof! Oh, shit!

使出必杀技
Activate death blow.

永别啦 盖
Bye, Guy.

我去 这是要放必杀技了
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

快起来
Get up!

妈 他要使出必杀技了
Mom, he's coming in with a death blow!

站起来
Get up, Guy.

噢
Oh.

什么鬼
What the shit?

牛了掰了
That was dope.

-等等 那是... -这是...
- Hold on. Is that…  - That's a…

颤抖吧 大佬 我们有光剑哦
Yes! That's a lightsaber, Dude.

-那是光剑吗 -是的
- Is that a lightsaber? - It is.

盖
Guy!

太好了
Yes!

好样的 加油 站起来 盖 快啊
Yes! That's right. Get up, Guy. Come on.

给你看看
There you go.

你能看见那些东西了
Do you see them all now? Yeah?

对吧
Uhhuh. Yeah?

亮闪闪的东西 到处都是
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

对 去吧 快点抓它们
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.

里面很多好吃的
Just lots of little snacks.

舞还跳得真烂 太烂了
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

自由地奔跑吧 雄壮的我
Run free, better me.

跟我走
Let's go.

去哪儿
Where are we going?

绝对不能让他们过那座桥
We can't let them get across that bridge.

想不想跟我一起完成这件事
You wanna finish this out with me?

虽然不知道你要干嘛 但我肯定要跟着你一起干
Look, I don't even know what's going on, but hell yes, I'm with you.

冲啊
Let's go!

服务器
安托万 你倒说啊
Antwan, come on, man.

我们来这儿干什么
What are we doing here?

《自由城1》的服务器在哪儿
Where are the servers to Free City 1?

不是 安托万 你这是要干什么
No. Antwan, what the hell are you doing?

要是被他们跑到地平线背后的场景上 我就玩完了
If they get past that horizon to the build, I lose everything!

这么说你真的盗用了他们的代码
Wait, so you did steal their code.

你总算明白过来了 大聪明
Welcome to the conversation, genius.

服务器在哪儿
Now, where are those servers?

这些都是 你先等等 我脑子还没转过来
It's all of these, but hold on. I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

所有这些 这个是吗 哪一个
All these? This one? Right, this one?

是的 你是怎么想的...
Yeah. How did you…

快跑
Run.

安托万
Antwan!

别砸了
Stop!

强尼警官
Officer Johnny!

-快起来 -快来 跑起来
- Come on! - Come on!

大海和那座桥的数据在哪个服务器上
Which server has the ocean and the rest of the bridge?

我不会告诉你的
I'm not gonna tell you.

你肯定会砸了它
You're just gonna destroy it.

对 我的东西我做主
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

才不是你的东西 这是键盘的游戏
Except it's not. It's Keys' game.

跟你没一毛钱关系
You didn't do shit.

我告诉你 键盘是我的好哥们儿
And guess what? Keys is my boy.

保安
Security!

这人已经不是我们的员工了 把他请出去
Please escort this former employee off the premises.

他连你们的名字都叫不出来
He can call you by your real name.

盖
Guy!

-巴迪 -不 你别管我 继续跑
- Buddy! Buddy! - No, no! Keep going!

没有我你也要去
Go without me!

我这辈子都畏首畏尾
I've been scared my whole damn life.

但我现在不怕了
But I'm not scared anymore.

对不起
I'm sorry.

我不后悔
I'm not.

这是我人生中最精彩的一天
It's been the best day of my life.

你一定要到达那个地方
You get to that build.

告诉世人我们的命也很重要
You show 'em we matter.

这位保安兄弟 是真男主真英雄
That security guard right there was a goddamn hero.

太好了
You did it!

他成功了 太好了
Yes! Yes!

食屎去吧 安托万 太好了
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

安托万 住手
Antwan, stop!

都结束了
It's over.

他成功了
He made it.

让所有人看到我的游戏里有你们的场景
Got your game's original build out there for everyone to see.

看来你能打赢官司了
Probably win your lawsuit, huh?

很有可能
Looks likely.

很好
Cool.

但现在有个问题 你看啊

你应该知道 这笔买卖
You know that this is, like, the dumbest deal

就算是世上最傻的傻子也不会答应
in the history of dumb deals, right?

你就这么把几百万美元送给我了
I mean, you're talking about giving up millions of dollars.

为什么
Why would anyone do that?

因为我和键盘已经有了最好的成果
'Cause Keys and I made something great.

我不需要金钱和名气来证明这一点
And I don't need money or fame to prove that to myself.

He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

事儿太多了没空看笑话
We're too busy to gloat.

我才是受害者
I'm a victim! I'm a victim!

说到事儿多 我刚又把独立访客承载量
Speaking of busy, we just doubled

翻了一倍
the amount of unique visitors we can handle.

好神奇
It's amazing.

谁能想到 居然会有这么多人...
Who'd have thought that so many people…

喜欢观察游戏角色而不是朝他们开枪
would just wanna watch video game characters instead of shoot at them?

嗯...
Hmm…

我们想到的
Oh, yeah, we did.

真是
Yeah.

知道 中度烘焙 一份奶油 两份糖

对
Yeah.

《自由人生》
嗨 兰迪 米尔顿
Hi, Randy. Milton.

嗯
Hmm.

感觉好久没见到你了
I was wondering when I'd see you again.

是啊 最近发生了太多夸张的事儿
Yeah, life has been pretty crazy lately.

我们这儿才叫夸张呢
You should see it in here.

Your taste in blue shirts and fiveoctave musical superstars…

深深地迷倒了我
it's deeply, deeply attractive to me.

可我不能永远和你在一起

我创造了这个世界 但我不能在里面生活
I created this world, but I can't live my life in it.

看 也不难吧
See? Was that so hard?

你接下来打算做什么
So, what are you gonna do?

做我想做的事儿 这多亏了你
Anything I want. Thanks to you.

我的生活可以往前走了
I'm not stuck in a loop anymore.

你也一样
Neither are you.

我爱你 米莉
I love you, Millie.

或许这真是我的程序设定 可你知道吗
Maybe that is my programming talking, but guess what?

是谁写了这个程序的
Someone wrote that program.

我只是一封写给你的情书
I'm just a love letter to you.

写情书的人在你的世界
Somewhere out there is the author.

米莉 是你给了他生命 是你让他活过来了
You brought him to life. You brought him to life.

他能活过来是因为他遇到了
And he was alive because he met the one person

一天到晚在哼 翻来覆去的哼
Like, all the time, she would…  repeat.

终于开窍了

像是魔法仙尘 或是像素仙尘...
and some like fairy dust, pixie dust…

接着就扑通一下 掉进了这座仙境般的乐园
and then I plopped down into this slice of heaven.

天 我爱死这儿了
Man, I love it here.

不瞒你说 就前两天 我还骑了一个半人马
In fact, a couple of days ago, I rode a centaur.

你可能觉得我在瞎扯...
Now, it might sound weird…

但我真的骑了一个一半是人一半是马的家伙...
I took a piggyback ride on a halfdude and a halfhorse…

货真价实的半人马 捎了我一段
