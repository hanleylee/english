根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》改编
原著 乔治・R・R・马丁

第一季第十集  Fire and Blood
血火同源

看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me!

小子  记得我吗
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

尤伦
守夜人 “浪鸦”

认出我了吧  这才是好孩子
Remember me? There's a bright boy.

小子  你跟我走
You'll be coming with me, boy,

把嘴巴闭上
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

珊莎・史塔克
临冬城公爵长女

给我乖乖闭嘴  小子  我不是小子
 Keep your mouth shut, boy.  I'm not a boy!

你不是聪明的小子  你是不是要说这个
You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say?

你想要命吗  小子
Do you want to live, boy?!

北方  小子  我们往北方去
North, boy, we're going north.

布兰・史塔克
临冬城公爵次子

它生了三只眼睛
It had three eyes.

要我跟它走  我就随它去了
It told me to come with him, so I did.

我们下到墓窖  父亲正在那里
We went down into the crypts and my father was there.

你父亲不在底下  小少爷
Your father's not down there, little lord.

那是很多年后的事情
Not for many years yet.

你害怕了  跟阿多一样
You're afraid... just like Hodor.

一个地洞才吓不倒我
I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

你在长城外长大  有什么吓得倒你
You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of?

我只是个残废的小孩  我都敢下去
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

欧莎
女野人

这是我爷爷瑞卡德公爵
That's my grandfather Lord Rickard.

他被疯王伊里斯活活烧死
He was burned alive by the Mad King Aerys.

那是莱安娜  我父亲的妹妹
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

劳勃国王本应该娶她
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

但雷加・坦格利安却把她强行掳走
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

为了救回她  劳勃挑起了战争
Robert started a war to win her back.

他杀了雷加  可她还是死了
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

我就是在这里看到父亲的
That's where I saw father.

你瞧  他不在这里
You see? He's not here.

回来  毛毛狗  瑞肯
 Here, shaggydog.  Rickon!

那头野东西应该被拴在狗舍里
That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!

他不喜欢被拴着  你在这里做什么
 He doesn't like chains.  What are you doing down here?

跟我们回去吧  不要  我来看爸爸的
 Come back up with us.  No, I came to see father.

我跟你说了多少次  他在君临城
How many times have I told you? He's in King's Landing

珊莎和艾莉亚也是
with Sansa and Arya.

他在这里  我看到他了
He was down here. I saw him.

什么时候看到的
Saw him when?

昨晚
Last night,

在我梦里
when I was sleeping.

走  毛毛狗
Here, Shaggydog.

你们都太想他了
You both miss him.

总想他自然也会梦到他
It's only natural he should be in your thoughts

并不会意味着...
and dreams, but that doesn't mean that...

鲁温
临冬城学士

布兰
Bran...

夫人  夫人
 My lady.  My lady.

夫人  夫人
 My lady.  My lady.

夫人  夫人
 My lady.  My lady.

夫人
My lady.

凯特琳・徒利
临冬城公爵夫人

罗柏
Robb.

罗柏
Robb.

罗柏
Robb!

罗柏・史塔克
临冬城公爵长子

你把剑都砍坏了
You've ruined your sword.

我要把他们全都杀掉
I'll kill them all...

一个不剩
...every one of them.

通通都杀掉
I will kill them all.

孩子
My boy.

你妹妹在他们手里
They have your sisters.

我们要救回女孩们
We have to get the girls back.

然后再把他们杀干净
And then we will kill them all.

野猪尖牙利如刀
*The boar's great tusks, they boded ill*

劳勃国王命难逃
*for good King Robert's health*

野猪野猪肥又壮
*and the beast was every bit as fat*

和咱劳勃一般样
*as Robert was himself*

勇猛国王高声吼  "放马过来与我斗"
*But our brave king cried, "Do your worst!*

"教你丑头断我手"
*I'll have your ugly head!*

"畜牲凶残又张狂"
*You're nowhere near as murd'rous as*

"岂如河东狮在床"
*the lion in my bed"*

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

劳勃国王败下场
*King Robert lost his battle and*

一世威名一朝丧
*he failed his final test*

先遭狮子爪下辱
*The lion ripped his balls off and*

又在野猪齿上亡
*the boar did all the rest*

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

非常有趣
Very amusing.

这曲子多好笑啊
Isn't it a funny song?

感谢你的献唱
Thank you for your rendition.

我猜你在酒馆唱的时候一定更受欢迎
I imagine it was even better received at that tavern.

非常抱歉  陛下
I'm so sorry, your grace.

我发誓  我再也不唱这首歌了
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

告诉我  你更喜欢哪样
Tell me, which do you favor:

你的手指还是你的舌头
your fingers or your tongue?

陛下
Your grace?

手指还是舌头
Fingers or your tongue?

如果只能留下一样  你选什么
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

我...我
I... I...

还是说我直接割了你喉咙
Or I could just cut your throat.

人不能没有手啊  陛下
Every man needs hands, your grace.

很好
Good.

那就舌头吧  陛下  开恩
 Tongue it is.  Your grace, please.

我再也不唱了...陛下
I won't sing... your grace.

伊林爵士  执行此刑
Ser Ilyn, who better than you

还有谁比你更合适呢  求您了
 to carry out the sentence?  I beg you!

请不要
Please no.

不
No!

伊林・派恩
御前执法官

求您了陛下  我保证再也不唱歌了
Your grace, please. I beg you, I will never sing again!

今天到此为止  不
 I'm done for the day.  Nooooo!

剩下的事情交给您了  母亲
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, mother.

陛下  求求您
Your grace, please!

你气色不错
You look quite nice.

多谢夸奖  大人
Thank you, my lord.

"陛下"  我现在是国王了
"Your grace." I'm king now.

住手  不
Stopppp! No!

陪我走走  我有东西给你看
Walk with me. I want to show you something.

桑铎・克里冈
御林铁卫 “猎狗”

照他说的做  孩子
Do as you're bid, child.

一旦你有了月事  我就会让你怀孕
And as soon as you've had your blood, I'll put a son in you.

母亲说不会太久了
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

不  求求你  不要这样
No, please no!

这个是你父亲
This one's your father.

就是这个
This one here.

仔细瞧瞧  这就是叛徒的下场
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

你答应我会手下留情  我留情了
 You promised to be merciful.  I was.

我让他死得干脆
I gave him a clean death.

看着他
Look at him.

求求您  让我回家吧
Please let me go home.

我保证不会背叛你
I won't do any treason, I swear.

母亲说我还是得娶你  所以你必须留在这儿
Mother says I'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here

还要乖乖听话
and obey.

看着他
Look at him!

怎么样
Well?

请问您还要我看多久
How long do I have to look?

直到我满意为止
As long as it pleases me.

还想看看其他人的吗
Do you want to see the rest?

只要陛下您高兴
If it please your grace.

这个是你的修女
That's your septa there.

告诉你
I'll tell you what:

我打算送你个礼物
I'm going to give you a present.

等我召集了自己的军队
After I raise my armies

杀了你的叛徒哥哥
and kill your traitor brother,

我要把他的首级也送给你
I'm going to give you his head as well.

说不定他会把你的脑袋拿来送我
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

母亲说国王不该动手打妻子
My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady.

马林爵士
Ser Meryn.

过来  小妹妹
Here, girl.

现在会听话了吗
Will you obey now?

还是要再教训你一次
Or do you need another lesson?

等会儿朝堂上见
I'll look for you in court.

小妹妹  学乖点  少挨揍
Save yourself some pain, girl.

他要怎样就怎样
Give him what he wants.

你以后还用得着
You'll be needing that again.

很明显应当这样做
The proper course is clear:

向蓝礼国王效忠  举兵南下
Pledge fealty to King Renly and move south

与他的大军会师
to join our forces with his.

蓝礼不是国王
Renly is not the king.

您总不能向乔佛里效忠吧  大人
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

他杀了您父亲
He put your father to death.

那不代表蓝礼就是国王
That doesn't make Renly king.

他是劳勃国王的二弟
He's Robert's youngest brother.

好比布兰不能先于我成为临冬城公爵
If Bran can't be lord of Winterfell before me,

席恩・葛雷乔伊
临冬城公爵养子

蓝礼也不能先于史坦尼斯取得王位
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

那您是说我们支持史坦尼斯吗
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

蓝礼即位不合规矩  诸位大人
 Renly is not right!  My lords.

如果我们支持史坦尼斯  诸位大人
 If we put ourselves behind Stannis...  My lords!

听我说说我对这两个国王的看法
Here is what I say to these two kings...

琼恩・安柏
史塔克家族的封臣 "大琼恩"

蓝礼・拜拉席恩对我来说狗屁不是
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

史坦尼斯也一样
nor Stannis neither.

凭什么让那些坐着花花椅子的
Why should they rule over me and mine

南方人来统治我们
from some flowery seat in the south?

他们哪里懂得绝境长城和狼林
What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood?

就连他们信奉的神也不是真神
Even their gods are wrong!

咱们为什么就不能再次自己管自己呢
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

当年令我们臣服的是真龙
It was the dragons we bowed to

眼下真龙已经死光啦
and now the dragons are dead!

只有一位国王让我心甘情愿地下跪
There sits the only king

他就在此座
I mean to bend my knee to...

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

这样的话  我也同意停战
I'll have peace on those terms.

就让他们继续守着红堡
They can keep their Red Castle

和铁椅子好了
and their iron chair too.

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

我是否永远都是你的兄弟
Am I your brother, now and always?

永远都是
Now and always.

不论凯歌高奏或是不幸败北
My sword is yours, in victory and defeat

我的剑属于你  从今起  矢志不渝
from this day until my last day.

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁  北境之王万岁
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁  北境之王万岁
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁
The King in the North!

北境之王万岁  北境之王万岁
The King in the North! The King in the North!

史塔克夫人  我要见他
 Lady Stark.  I want to see him.

马上
Now!

退下
Leave us.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 国王舅舅 “弑君者”

史塔克夫人  今晚您看上去迷人极了
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

孀居生活蛮适合您
Widowhood becomes you.

想必是孤枕难眠
Your bed must be lonely.

所以您才过来的吧
Is that why you came?

我现在状态不佳
I'm not at my best,

不过应该还能为您效劳
but I think I could be of service.

不如您脱下袍子  看看我能否...
You slip out of that gown and we'll see if I'm up to...

我就喜欢暴力的女人
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

我要杀了你  爵士
I will kill you tonight, Ser,

将你的首级装在盒子里  给你姐姐送去
pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.

我来教你怎么杀人
Let me show you how...

照我耳朵上方继续打
Hit me again, over the ear.

一直打  别停下
And again and again.

你的劲儿应当不小  用不了多久
You're stronger than you look... it shouldn't take long.

你就想让世人都相信
That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it?

你并不怕死  对吗
That you don't fear death.

我真不怕  夫人
But I don't, my lady.

黑暗降临  无人幸免  哭有何用
The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?

因为如果诸神公正
Because you are going to the deepest

你必被打入七层地狱的最深渊
of the seven hells, if the gods are just.

你说的是谁家诸神
What gods are those?

你丈夫顶礼膜拜的那些树吗
The trees your husband prayed to?

他掉脑袋的时候  那些树又在哪里
Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off?

如果你的神真的存在  如果他们真的公正
If your gods are real and if they are just,

那为何世上尽是不公之事
why is the world so full of injustice?

就因为有像你这样的人
Because of men like you.

没人能像我  世上只有一个我
There are no men like me. Only me.

我儿子布兰
My son Bran.

是怎么从塔上摔下来的
How did he come to fall from that tower?

是我把他推出窗外
I pushed him out the window.

为什么
Why?

我希望能摔死他
I hoped the fall would kill him.

为什么
Why?

你该去睡觉了
You should get some sleep.

这场战争远没到尽头
It's going to be a long war.

不敢相信  真打起来了
I can't believe we're actually at war.

你年轻时那场仗有没有这么刺激呀
Was it this exciting last time, when you were young?

信上说了什么
What does it say?

我们抓住罗柏・史塔克了吗
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

蓝赛尔・兰尼斯特
国王的侍从 王后的堂弟

下一步怎么做  闭嘴
 What's our next move?  Stop talking.

回床上去
Get back into bed.

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 西境守护 国王外祖父

我儿子在他们手上
They have my son.

凯冯・兰尼斯特
泰温・兰尼斯特之弟

看来史塔克小子没我们指望的那么嫩啊
The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
国王舅舅 "小恶魔"

听闻他的狼杀了十几个人  咬死十几匹马
I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.

关于史坦尼斯和蓝礼的消息是真的吗
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

拜拉席恩两兄弟都开始对付我们了
Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us.

詹姆被俘  围城军队又遭击溃
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

简直是大难临头
It's a catastrophe.

也许我们应该求和
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

这就是你要的和平
There's your peace.

打从乔佛里决定
Joffrey saw to that

取下奈德・史塔克的头开始就注定了
when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

眼下要跟罗柏・史塔克求和
You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup

比用地下这破杯装酒还难
than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now.

占上风的是他
He's winning...

难道您没发现
in case you hadn't noticed.

听说我们手上握有他的两个妹妹
I'm told we still have his sisters.

第一要务就是赎回詹姆爵士
The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.

不要求和  这是向敌人示弱
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.

我们应该立刻进兵
We should march on them at once.

我们应当先回凯岩城集结起...
First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise...

我儿子在他们手上
They have my son!

退下  统统退下
Get out, all of you.

你留下
Not you.

关于艾德・史塔克  你的判断没错
You were right about Eddard Stark.

假如他还活着  我们可以用他当筹码
If he were alive, we could have used him

与临冬城和奔流城达成停战
to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

如此一来  便有时间
which would have given us more time

全力对付劳勃的两个弟弟  而眼下
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

胡来  完全是胡来
madness... madness and stupidity.

我原以为你生来只有杂耍的份
I always thought you were a stunted fool.

也许我想错了
Perhaps I was wrong.

不全错
Half wrong.

虽然我刚开始接触战略  但...
I'm new to strategy, but...

除非我们想遭受三面夹击
unless we want to be surrounded by three armies,

否则  此地不宜久留
it appears we can't stay here.

没人打算留在这里
No one will stay here.

格雷果爵士将率领五百骑兵
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

从神眼湖到红叉河  让河间地带化为焦土
and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

剩下的人到赫伦堡集结
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

我要派你去君临
And you will go to King's Landing.

做什么
And do what?

管事
Rule!

你将代我出任御前首相
You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead.

管管那位年轻的国王
You will bring that boy king

如有必要  还要管管他的母亲
to heel and his mother too, if needs be.

倘若那几个重臣
And if you get so much

有那么一点点居心不良的征兆
as a whiff of treason from any of the rest:

贝里席  瓦里斯  派席尔
Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...

砍头  枪尖插着  挂上城墙
Heads, spikes, walls.

为何不派叔叔去
Why not my uncle?

为何是我  不是别人
Why not anyone? Why me?

因为你是我儿子
You're my son.

还有一件事
Oh, one more thing:

不准你带那个妓女进宫
you will not take the whore to court.

明白吗
Do you understand?

乔拉爵士
Ser Jorah?

慢一点  慢一点
Gently gently.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
卡丽熙

我儿子
My son...

乔拉・莫尔蒙
杰奥・莫尔蒙之子

他在哪儿  我要见他
Where is he? I want him.

他在哪儿
Where is he?

孩子没活成
The boy did not live.

告诉我  您要我说什么
 Tell me.  What is there to tell?

我儿子是怎么死的
How did my son die?!

公主殿下  他根本就没活成
He never lived, my princess.

那些女人说...
The women say...

那些女人说什么
What do the women say?

她们说那孩子是...  怪物
 They say the child was...  Monstrous,

畸形扭曲
Twisted.

我亲自帮他接生
I pulled him out myself.

弥丽・马兹・笃尔
神庙女祭司

他像蜥蜴一样全身长满鳞片
He was scaled like a lizard,

眼睛是瞎的  长了对蝙蝠样的小翅膀
blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat.

我一碰他  他的皮肉就从骨头上脱落
When I touched him the skin fell from his bones.

里面满满的都是蛆虫
Inside he was full of graveworms.

我警告过你  惟有死亡方能换取生命
I warned you that only death can pay for life.

您很清楚代价是什么
You knew the price.

卓戈卡奥人在哪里
Where is Khal Drogo?

带我去见他
Show him to me.

我要看看
Show me what I bought

我用儿子的性命换来了什么
with my son's life.

如您所愿  夫人
As you command, lady.

请随我来
Come.

我带您去见他
I will take you to him.

以后有的是时间  我现在就要见他
 Time enough for that later...  I want to see him now.

卓戈的卡拉萨走了
The Khalasar is gone.

无法骑马的卡奥没有资格当卡奥
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

多斯拉克人只追随强者
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

公主殿下  我很遗憾
I'm sorry, my princess.

卓戈
Drogo!

卓戈・卡奥 
多斯拉克部族首领

我的日和星

他为什么一个人待在这里
Why is he out here alone?

他似乎喜欢阳光的温暖  公主殿下
He seems to like the warmth, princess.

他活了下来
He lives.

您要的是他的生命  您也支付了生命
You asked for life, you paid for life.

这根本不是生命
This is not life.

要多久他才会变回以前那样
When will he be as he was?

等太阳从西边升起  在东边落下
When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east.

等海水干枯
When the seas go dry.

山脉像枯叶一样随风吹落
When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

你们退下
Leave us.

我不能让你单独和巫魔女在一起
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

我已经一无所有  没什么好怕她的了
I have nothing more to fear from this woman.

去吧
Go.

你明知我会得到什么  也明知代价是什么
You knew what I was buying and you knew the price.

他们烧了我的神庙  这是不对的
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

他们触怒了至高牧神
It angered the Great Shepherd.

神灵才不会做出这种事
This is not god's work.

我的孩子是无辜的  无辜的
 My child was innocent.  Innocent?

他本来会成为骑着世界的骏马
He would have been the stallion who mounts the world.

如今他没有办法烧毁城市
Now he will burn no cities.

他的卡拉萨再也无法令其他国度灰飞烟灭了
Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.

是我替你求情
I spoke for you.

是我救了你
I saved you.

救我
Saved me?

孩子  你救我之前
Three of those riders had already

我已经被三名骑手上过了
raped me before you saved me, girl.

我见到我神的庙堂遭到焚烧
I saw my god's house burn,

而我曾在那里医治过不计其数的善男信女
there where I had healed men and women beyond counting.

街上随处可见堆堆人头
In the streets I saw piles of heads...

人头堆里有给我做面包吃的烘焙师傅
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

有罹患热病
the head of a young boy

好容易才救活的小男孩  也就三个月前的事
that I had cured of fever just three moons past.

你倒是说说看
So tell me again exactly what it was

你救了什么
that you saved.

我救了你的命
Your life.

那就好好瞧瞧你的卡奥
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

让你明白当一切都消失的时候
Then you will see exactly what life is worth

生命究竟有何价值
when all the rest has gone.

你不能走
You can't!

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令的事务官

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人事务官

山姆  别挡道
Get out of my way, Sam.

他们会放出话去
They'll put out the word.

派出渡鸦  会有人来追你的
They'll send out ravens. People will come after you.

你知道逃兵会有何下场吗
Do you know what happens to deserters?

比你清楚
Better than you do.

你打算怎么做
What are you going to do?

直接去找我哥
I'm gonna find my brother

然后亲手血刃乔佛里国王
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

你不能这样一走了之  大伙需要你
You can't leave us now. We need you here.

走开  我不会放你走
 Move.  I won't let you go.

走开  不
 Move.  No.

白灵
琼恩・雪诺的冰原狼

御前首相
Hand of the King?

看来是这样
So it would seem.

雪伊
妓女

你老爸还说
And your father said you

不准你带任何人去君临
couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing.

不  他只说不准我带你去君临
No, he said I couldn't take you with me to King's Landing.

他特意强调这一点
He was very specific on that point.

他知道我的名字
He knew my name?

什么
What?

他说"不准带雪伊去君临"吗
He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?

相信他用的是"妓女"这个词
I believe he used the word "Whore."

怕我丢了你的脸吗
Are you ashamed of me?

怕我在宫廷上跳脱衣舞是吗
Are you afraid that i'm dancing around the court with my tits out?

我现在很可笑是吧
I'm funny now?

我是可笑的妓女雪伊
I'm Shae the funny whore.

我老爸可能是海内最有权势的人
My father's probably the most powerful man in the country.

财力更是无人能及
Certainly the richest.

他可以将七国玩弄于股掌
He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets.

无论何人  来自何方
Everyone everywhere

都要对他唯命是从
always has to do exactly what my father says.

他一直都这么混账
He's always been a cunt.

相信朝廷里的夫人小姐
I believe the ladies of the court

能从你这样的姑娘身上学到很多
could learn a great deal from a girl like you.

不如就跟我一起进宫
Why don't you come with me,

做首相夫人怎样
be the Hand's lady?

因为国王需要首相  而首相需要...
Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand...

我知道首相的需求
I know what a Hand needs.

白灵  驾
 Ghost?  Hyah!

驾  驾
 Hyah.  Hyah!

驾
Hyah.

山姆威尔
Samwell!

他死了吗  没死
 Is he dead?  No, he's not dead.

找到他了吗
Did we get him?

拜托  帮我扶他起来
Come on, help me get him up.

幸亏你皮糙肉厚
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

派普尔
守夜人 亦称“派普”

葛兰
守夜人的游骑兵

我们要把你带回属于你的地方
We're taking you back to where you belong.

我属于我的兄弟  我们就是你的兄弟
 I belong with my brother.  But we're your brothers now.

如果他们发现你跑了  你会被砍头的
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

若是他们知道你们来追我  你们也会没命
They'll kill you if they know you came after me.

回去吧  山姆都跟我们说了
 Go back.  Sam told us everything.

你父亲的事我们很遗憾  但那与你无关
 We're sorry about your father.  But it doesn't matter.

一旦发了誓  你就不能离开
You took the oath. You can't leave.

我非走不可  不行
 I have to.  You can't.

你发过誓了  我不在乎
 You said the words.  I don't care about...

"倾听我的誓言  做我的见证"
"Hear my words and bear witness to my vow..."

你们都见鬼去吧
To hell with all of you.

"长夜将至  我从今开始守望
"Night gathers and now my watch begins.

至死方休
It shall not end until my death.

我将尽忠职守  生死于斯"
I shall live and die at my post."

"我是黑暗中的利剑"
"I am the sword in the darkness..."

"长城上的守卫
"The watcher on the walls,

守护王国的坚盾
The shield that guards the realms of men.

我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,

今夜如此  夜夜皆然"
for this night and all nights to come."

还记得我们的初次结合吗  我的日和星

如果你还在  如果你没有离开  告诉我

你是战士  一直都是  我现在需要你战斗

我知道你在远方  但回来吧  我的日和星

当太阳从西边升起
When the sun rises in the west

在东边落下
and sets in the east...

你才会变回以前的模样  我的日和星
Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.

国王们
Kings?

我可以告诉你国王们的一切
Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about kings.

派席尔
大学士

关于那些国王  你要知道的事情是...
The thing you need to understand about kings is...

过去的六十七年里  我所了解
For the past 67 years, I've known...

真正了解的国王比任何人都多
truly known more kings than any man alive.

他们个个难以捉摸  不过我知道该如何辅佐
They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them.

是啊
Yes.

而且从未失去我的位子
And keep on serving them.

伊里斯・坦格利安
Aerys Targaryen...

诸神播撒给我们的众多劣性当中
Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us,

疯狂是最要命的
Madness is the worst.

他是个好人
He was a good man,

非常有魅力
such a charmer.

眼见他在我面前日渐改变
To watch him melt away before my eyes,

迷失在血与火的迷梦之中
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

劳勃・拜拉席恩则是头截然不同的猛兽
Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal...

是个厉害的人物  伟大的战士
powerful man, a great warrior...

但可惜的是  打江山容易
But alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom

守江山难
are rather different things.

人家说老罩着面甲过日子的人
They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down,

容易看不到身侧的敌人
he can often be blind to the enemies at his side.

而现在  我辅佐他儿子乔佛里国王
Now I serve his son King Joffrey,

愿诸神保佑他国泰民安
may the gods bless his reign.

他是个能干的年轻人  好战心强
He is a capable young man... strong military mind.

而且严厉
Stern...

不过对保护王国而言  严厉不算缺点
but sternness in defense of the realm is no vice.

现在说他会成为怎样的国王  还为时尚早
It's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be,

但我能预料到  这位新国王必有丰功伟绩
but I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king.

罗丝
妓女

丰功伟绩
True greatness.

你说的那件事呢
So what's the thing?

什么事
What thing?

国王的事啊
About kings.

你说  "关于国王  你要知道的事"
You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings..."

事情  什么事情
What? Things? What?

你刚开始说的  算了
When you started, you... never mind.

我送你出去吧  亲爱的
Let me see you out, my dear.

没事  你坐着吧  好吧
 It's all right. No need.  Yes yes.

下次再见了
Till the next time.

培提尔・贝里席
财政大臣 “小指头”

想想看  你要是坐在上面会是什么样子
When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?

瓦里斯
太监 情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

王冠合适吗  多年以来对你嗤之以鼻的
Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies

老爷夫人们会不会虚情假意地向你卑躬屈膝
simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?

没了脑袋  他们想卑躬屈膝也难
It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.

野心勃勃  而道德沦丧
A man with great ambition and no morals...

我可不敢与你为敌
I wouldn't bet against you.

我的朋友  要是你坐上去了
And what would you do, my friend,

又会怎么做呢
if you found yourself sitting up there?

我一定是城里为数不多的
I must be one of the few men in this city

对王座毫无兴趣的人
who doesn't want to be king.

你一定是城里为数不多的
You must be one of the few men in the city

不算男人的男人
who isn't a man.

积点口德吧
Oh, you can do better than that.

你被阉的时候
When they castrated you,

是既取卵又杀鸡吗
did they take the pillar with the stones?

我一直都很好奇  是吗
 I've always wondered.  Have you?

你还费心巴力地琢磨我下身是什么样子吗
Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?

我估摸着就像女人一样  是条缝
I picture a gash like a woman's.

猜中了吗
Is that about right?

我真是受宠若惊啊  还劳烦您琢磨我下身
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

虽说过了这么多年  你肯定还是不习惯吧
Must be strange for you, even after all these years...

来自异国他乡
a man from another land,

为众人所鄙夷
despised by most,

无人不畏惧
feared by all...

我是这样的吗  承蒙您告知
Am I? That is good to know.

你有没有因为害怕我那条缝而夜不能寐呀
Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?

但你挺了过来  在一任又一任的国王耳边
But you carry on, whispering in one king's ear

轻声低语
and then the next.

我真心钦佩您
I admire you.

我也钦佩您  贝里席大人
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

出身卑微  攀附权势  最大的才能就是
A grasper from a minor house with a major talent

结交有权有势的主子  以及女主
for befriending powerful men and women.

很实用的才能  我相信你也同意
A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

所以呢  我们在这儿
So here we stand...

彼此钦佩  互相尊重
in mutual admiration and respect.

各扮其角
Playing our roles.

辅佐新王
Serving a new king.

愿其长久
Long may he reign.

国王陛下  国王陛下
 My king.  My king.

各位大人  可以开始了吗
My lords. Shall we begin?

你现在就叫阿利了  听到没
You're Arry now, hear me?

孤儿阿利
Arry the orphan boy.

没人会盘问孤儿
No one asks an orphan too many questions

因为没人在乎
'cause nobody gives three shits.

你叫什么
What's your name?

阿利
Arry.

路还长  和你作伴的都不是什么好东西
We have a long way to travel and in bad company.

这回我弄到二十个人
I have 20 this time,

有大人  有小孩  全都送去长城
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

你父亲大人让我自己去牢里挑人
Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons

那儿可没啥贵族少爷之流
and I didn't find no little lordlings down there.

这群人有一半连想都不想就会把你交给国王
This lot, half of them would turn you over to the king

以换取赦免
quick as spit for a pardon.

而另一半也会这么做
And the other half would do the same,

不过会先强暴你再说
except they'd rape you first.

所以你小心一点
So keep to yourself...

要撒尿就自个儿到林子里撒
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

你和这帮人待着  小子
You stay with this lot, boy.

别乱跑
And stay...

不然你就跟他们仨锁在马车后面
or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.

看路  小矮子
Watch yourself, midget.

他竟然有一把剑
He's got a sword, this one.

你这种贱人要剑干嘛
What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?

说不定是哪家的小跟班
Maybe he's a little squire.

他才不是啥跟班  你瞧瞧
He ain't no squire. Look at him.

简直就一娘们儿
He looks like a girl.

我敢打赌  八成是偷来的
I bet he stole that sword.

拿来瞧瞧
Let's have a look.

我倒很想有这么一把剑哩
I could use me a sword like that.

你去抢来啊  拿剑来  小矮子
 Take it off him.  Give it here, midget.

你看这家伙
Look at him!

你最好把剑拿给热派
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

他以前把一个男孩活活踢死了
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

我把他揍倒在地  然后猛踢他老二
I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls

一直踢到他死为止
and I kept kicking him until he was dead.

我把他踢得稀烂
I kicked him all to pieces.

你最好把剑拿来  你想要吗
 You better give me that sword!  You want it?

我可以给你
I'll give it to you.

我杀过一个小胖子
I already killed one fat boy.

我敢打赌  你没杀过人
I bet you never killed anyone.

你刚才那是撒谎  但我是说真的
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

我最会杀小胖子
I'm good at killing fat boys.

最喜欢杀小胖子
I like killing fat boys.

你就喜欢欺负小个子  是吧
Oh, you like picking on the little ones, do you?

要知道  我打铁有十年了
You know, I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years.

我打铁的时候  铁会唱歌
When I hit that steel, it sings.

我打你的时候  你会不会唱啊
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

这是城里铁匠用精钢打的
This is castleforged steel.

你从哪儿偷的
Where'd you steal it?

别人送我的  无所谓了
 It was a gift.  It don't matter now.

我们要去的地方  没人计较你的过去
Where we're going, they don't care what you've done.

多得是强奸犯、小偷、强盗、杀人犯
They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen ... murderers.

那你呢  武器师傅的学徒
 Which are you?  Armorer's apprentice.

师傅不想要我了
But my master got sick of me,

就送我来这儿
so here I am.

出发  你们这群婊子养的
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

从这儿到长城要赶上千里路
It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall

而且凛冬将至
and winter is coming!

杰奥・莫尔蒙
守夜人总司令

又是火腿
Ham.

天天早餐都吃火腿
How many days in a row must a man be

这到哪天才是头儿啊
expected to start his day with ham?

起码给我倒杯啤酒吧
Bring me some beer at least.

你没什么精神
You look exhausted.

昨晚骑马就这么累啊
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

别害怕
Don't look so terrified.

要是我把每个半夜开溜的人都抓来砍头
If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night,

那防守长城的就只剩鬼魂了
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

好歹你没去鼹鼠村嫖妓
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

荣誉心驱使你离开
Honor made you leave,

荣誉心也鞭策你回来
honor brought you back.

带我回来的是我的朋友们
My friends brought me back.

我又没说是你的荣誉心
I didn't say it was your honor.

他们杀害了我父亲
They killed my father.

你有办法让他起死回生吗
And you're going to bring him back to life, are you?

没有吧  很好
No? Good.

这种怪事我们可不希望再有了
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

长城外的游骑兵回报
Beyond the Wall, the rangers are

好些村落完全被遗弃
reporting whole villages abandoned.

他们在夜晚看见群山中的火光
At night they see fires blazing in the mountains

从黄昏直烧到天亮
from dusk until dawn.

一个被抓的野人发誓说
A captured wildling swears their

许多部落齐聚到一处秘密要塞
tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold,

他们目的为何  只有天上诸神知道
to what ends the gods only know.

东海望外面
Outside Eastwatch

卡特・派克的手下发现了四具蓝眼死尸
Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blueeyed corpses.

他们比我们聪明  直接就烧掉了
Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them.

你觉得你兄弟的战争
Do you think your brother's war

比我们这场战争更重要吗
is more important than ours?

不  等哪天夜里  死人
 No.  When dead men and worse

还有更邪乎的家伙大举入侵
come hunting for us in the night,

你觉得谁坐在铁王座上还有差别吗
do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne?

没有  很好
 No.  Good.

等我们明天越墙北进时
Because I want you and your wolf with us

我希望你和你那头狼与我们同在
when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.

越墙北进
Beyond the Wall?

我不会干坐在这儿等风雪来临
I'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows.

我一定要知道究竟发生了什么
I mean to find out what's happening.

这次守夜人军团要大举出动
The Night's Watch will ride in force

与敌人正面交锋  管它是野人
against the wildlings, the white walkers

异鬼  还是别的什么东西
and whatever else is out there.

我们要找到班扬・史塔克
And we will find Benjen Stark,

不论是死是活
alive or dead.

我将亲自领军
I will command them myself.

所以呢  雪诺大人  我就问你一句
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

出发
Move out!

你究竟是守夜人的弟兄
...Are you a brother of the Night's Watch

还是只爱玩骑马打仗的私生小毛头
or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?

卡丽熙  这是您的命令吗

卓戈在夜晚的国度是用不着龙蛋的
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the night lands.

不如卖掉  然后返回自由城邦
Sell them. You can return to the free cities

所换的财富够您一辈子享用不尽
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

这些蛋不是要我拿去卖的
They were not given to me to sell.

卡丽熙  女王陛下
Khaleesi, my queen,

我发誓效忠于您  奉行您的一切旨意
I vow to serve you, obey you,

牺牲性命  在所不辞
to die for you if need be,

但请让他去吧  卡丽熙
But let him go, Khaleesi.

我知道您的打算  千万不要啊
I know what you intend. Do not.

我必须这么做
I must.

你不了解
You don't understand...

若您爬上卓戈的火葬台  休想叫我袖手旁观
Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.

我不能眼睁睁看您被火焚烧
I won't watch you burn.

你怕的就是这个
Is that what you fear?

你们将是我的卡拉萨
You will be my khalasar.

我看到的是奴隶的脸
I see the faces of slaves.

现在  你们自由了
I free you.

取下奴隶项圈吧  若要走  没人阻拦你们
Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

但如果你们选择留下
But if you stay,

你们将彼此成为兄弟姐妹
it will be as brothers and sisters,

或者男女夫妻
as husbands and wives.

乔拉爵士  将这女人绑上火葬台
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

你发誓奉行我的意旨
You swore to obey me.

我是风暴降生丹妮莉丝
I am Daenerys Stormborn

来自流淌古老瓦雷利亚血液的坦格利安家族
of house Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria.

我是龙的女儿
I am the dragon's daughter.

我向你们发誓
And I swear to you

凡是伤害你们的人  必将哀嚎而死
that those who would harm you will die screaming.

你不会听见我的哀嚎
You will not hear me scream.

我会的
I will.

但我要的不是你的哀嚎
But it is not your screams I want.

而是你的命
Only your life.

吾血之血
Blood of my blood.
