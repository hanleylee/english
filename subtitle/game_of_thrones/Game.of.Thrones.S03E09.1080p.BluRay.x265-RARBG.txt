根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》改编
原著 乔治・R・R・马丁

第三季第九集   Deadly trap 
致命陷阱

你确定吗？
Are you sure about this?

不
No.

这太危险了
It's dangerous.

如果我们攻下泰温的老巢
If we take Tywin's castle from him,

维斯特洛的领主们就会知道他不是无敌的
the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.

夺走他的家园 他的财富
Take his home,

削弱他的实力
take his gold, take his power.

凯特琳・徒利
艾德・史塔克的遗孀

你为什么要找我商量？
Why are you telling me?

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

你恳求我不要派席恩
You begged me not to send Theon

去与他父亲交涉 我没有听从你的建议
to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.

结果临冬城被烧成灰烬
Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground,

北境被铁种蹂躏
the North is overrun with ironborn,

还失去了布兰和瑞肯
and Bran and Rickon are gone.

现在 说到凯岩城… 
So Casterly Rock...

我想征询你的建议
I'm asking your advice.

你有足够的兵力吗？
We have enough men?

只要瓦德・佛雷愿意合作
If Walder Frey cooperates.

只要瓦德・佛雷愿意合作
If Walder Frey cooperates.

如果在我们拿下城堡前
If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing

君临派出的援兵赶到… 
before we take the castle...

我们就会被困在泰温的军队和大海之间
we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.

我们就会输掉这场战争 像父亲那样背着谋逆的罪名死去
We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.

甚至更糟
Or worse.

让他们尝尝失去挚爱的滋味
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

灰风
罗柏・史塔克的冰原狼

宾客权利：
是维斯特洛大陆传承了千年的一项传统。无论平民还是贵族，当宾客来到主人的屋檐下做客，
接受了主人提供的食物和水（盐和面包），宾客权利即生效。在此后的做客期间，
双方均不得加害对方。违者会触犯神圣的条律，据信会为新旧诸神所不容。

我尊贵的客人
My honored guests...

欢迎进入我的城堡
be welcome within my walls

瓦德・佛雷
孪河城侯爵

来到我的桌边
and at my table.

七神见证
I extend to you my hospitality

我给予你们款待和保护
and protection in the light of the Seven.

感谢您的慷慨好客 大人
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

我来是为了致以诚挚的歉意 大人
I have come to make my apologies, my lord,

并且恳求您的宽恕
and to beg your forgiveness.

无需恳求我的宽恕 陛下
Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.

您摒弃的不是我 是我的女儿
It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.

她们中本应出个王后
One of them was supposed to be queen.

艾德慕・徒利
奔流城公爵 凯特琳・徒利之弟

如今却旁落他人
Now none of them are.

这是我女儿艾雯
This is Arwyen my daughter.

我女儿瓦妲 我女儿德娃
My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa,

我女儿瓦拉
my daughter Waldra.

乔苏珊・恩佛德
瓦德・佛雷的第八任妻子

我大孙女
My eldest granddaughters

吉娜和内娜
Ginia and Neila.

双胞胎孙女西拉和撒拉
Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.

你可以在她们两个中任选一个
You could have had either.

或者都选了我也没意见
Could have had both for all I care.

我孙女玛蕊莲
My granddaughter Marianne.

我孙女法拉
My granddaughter Freya.

我孙女…
My granddaughter...

薇法
Wertha.

瓦拉
Waldra.

瓦蒂娜
Waldina.

我叫玛丽  好吧
I'm Merry. Fine.

还有我的小女儿希琳
And here's my youngest daughter Shirei,

虽然她还没来潮
though she hasn't bled yet.

显然你不会对她们有兴趣
Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.

小姐们
My ladies.

人人都必须信守承诺 尤其是身为君主的我
All men should keep their word, kings most of all.

我曾庄严发誓将迎娶您们中的一位 后来却背弃了誓言
I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.

这不是你们的错 而是我的过失
The fault is not with you.

可以得到你们中任何一位都是男人的幸运
Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.

泰丽莎・梅葛亚
小护士 罗柏的王后

布林登・徒利
“黑鱼” 凯特琳・徒利之叔

我并不是有意怠慢你们
I did what I did not to slight you,

而是因为我真心爱上一位女子
but because I loved another.

我明白 没有语言可以抚平
I know these words cannot set right

我对你们的家族和你们所造成的伤害
the wrong I have done to you and your house.

我恳求你们的原谅
I beg your forgiveness

并且愿意做一切可能的补偿
and pledge to do all I can to make amends

希望河渡口的佛雷家族和临冬城的史塔克家族
so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell

可以再度成为盟友
may once again be friends.

很好
Very good.

就是她吧
There she is.

靠近点
Come closer.

让我看看你
Let me have a look at you.

还是看不清
Still can't see you.

眼花啦
Old eyes.

真爱
Love.

临冬城的史塔克家族是这么称呼它的 嗯？
That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?

真高贵
Very honorable.

我说应该叫漂亮脸蛋
I call it a pretty face.

嗯 真漂亮
Mmm, very pretty.

毫无疑问 比这儿的都漂亮
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.

曲线也不错
Very shapely as well.

噢 你想用衣服把她藏起来
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.

如果你真的想把她藏起来
If you wanted to hide her,

那你一开始就不应该把她带到这儿来
you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.

我一眼就能看透
I can always see

衣服底下是什么样子
what's going on beneath a dress.

这么多年我可不是白活的
Been at this a long time.

我敢打赌你脱掉这件衣服时
I bet when you take that dress off,

身材完全没走样
everything stays right where it is.

一寸也不会下垂
Doesn't drop an inch.

你的国王说他是为了爱情背叛我
Your king says he betrayed me for love.

我说他是为了这对坚挺的乳头
I say he betrayed me for firm tits

和紧实的小穴
and a tight fit.

这我可以理解啊
And I can respect that.

我像你这么大的时候 为了这种尤物
When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths

想都不用想就会打破50个誓言
to get into that without a second thought.

看来 这个大厅的空间只够你们这些人
Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.

我们会在外面搭起帐篷
We'll set up tents outside

给你其余的人马提供食物和麦酒
with food and ale for the rest of your men.

谢谢你 大人
Thank you, my lord.

好了 让我们准备好吧
Well, let's get ready.

酒浆斟起来
The wine will flow red

音乐奏起来
and the music will play loud

让我们把这些杂七杂八的事都抛到脑后
and we'll put this mess behind us.

在哪儿？
Where?

那儿
There.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
“大熊” 熊老之子

这儿 这是个后门
There. It's a back gate.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
风暴降生 龙之母

达里奥・纳哈里斯
次子团成员

我的人穿过这儿去光顾渊凯的床奴
My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

你的人 但没有你？
Your men, but not you?

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

我对奴隶没有性趣
I have no interest in slaves.

一个男人不应该和物品做爱
A man cannot make love to property.

我们就是从这儿进入城市
This is where we enter the city.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
“无谓的”女王铁卫

守卫很少 他们认识我
Very few guards. They know me.

他们会让我进去… 
They let me inside

我们没法让一整支军队通过后门潜入城市
We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.

我会杀了守卫兵 带上你手下最强的两个人
I kill the guards. I take your two best men

带他们穿过我熟知的深巷
and lead them through the back streets, which I know well,

打开大门
and open the front gates.

迎接大军
Then comes the army.

一旦城墙被破 城池将顷刻不保
Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.

你也有可能让灰虫子和我陷身屠杀
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter,

让我们军队成为无头之师
cutting the head off our army.

渊凯的首领会给你奖赏
The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee

你也不用把这份奖赏和其他两个人分了
and you won't have to split it three ways

因为你早就把你的搭档灭口了
'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.

你这人倒是疑心很重啊
You have a very suspicious mind.

就我看来 只有奸诈之人才会这么想
In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.

你是统领无垢者的人
You command the Unsullied.

你怎么想？
What do you think?

你已是个将军了

你相信他吗？

我相信他

你们今晚就动身
You leave tonight.

很好
Very good.

好好准备
We'll prepare.

乔拉爵士
Ser Jorah.

我可以助你一臂之力
You can use an extra sword.

巴利斯坦爵士 你是女王铁卫
You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.

你该留在女王身边
Your place is by the queen.

若我们真心效忠于她
If we are truly her loyal servants,

就该万死不辞
we'll do whatever needs to be done

不惜代价 无虑荣耀
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

我们现在是在黑城堡的西边
We're west of Castle Black,

不过长夜堡离我们最近
but the Nightfort's closest to us.

这是长城上的第一座城堡
It was the first castle on the Wall.

守夜人军团在杰赫里斯一世时期就将它遗弃了
The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

因为它太过庞大 难以维持
Too big. Impossible to maintain.

相对于黑城堡
Other than Castle Black itself,

长夜堡是对我们来说最完美的堡垒
the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.

它有一个秘密的出入口
It's got a secret sally port,

那就是跟长城同样古老的黑门
the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.

它通往长城
No one's used it in centuries most likely.

正好落在长夜堡之中
It leads through the Wall

恐怕几百年来都没有人使用过它
right down into the Nightfort,

直到有人发现了它
if one knows how to find it,

那人就是我
which, it just so happens, I do.

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人事务官

你是怎么知道这些的？
How do you know all that?

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿与妻子

我在一本古籍中读到过
I read about it in a very old book.

你就是靠盯着书上那些符号
You know all that

知道所有这些的吗？
from staring at marks on paper?

是啊
Yes.

你真像个巫师
You're like a wizard.

我们的父亲曾经告诉我们
Our father used to tell us

从来没有野人能活着看到长城
that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.

可我们现在
Here we are.

活得好好的站在这儿
Alive.

桑铎・克里冈
“猎狗”

记住那个逃跑孩子的下场
Remember what happens to children who run.

艾莉亚・史塔克

我现在是你的父亲 一切由我来开口
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

这些路真是糟糕透了啊
The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they?

今早已经弄坏三个轮轴了
Cracked three spokes this morning.

来帮你一把？  十个你也不够哎
Need a hand? Need about eight hands.

喔！
Oh!

我得在婚礼之前
Got to get this salt pork to the Twins

按时把这些咸猪肉运到孪河城
in time for the wedding.

多谢
Many thanks.

住手！
Don't!

别杀他！
Don't kill him.

死人才不会开口
Dead rats don't squeak.

你真是残酷
You're so dangerous, aren't you?

对小女孩们说那些恐怖的东西
Saying scary things to little girls.

杀害小男孩和老人
Killing little boys and old people.

你可真是冷酷无情
A real hard man you are.

我比你见过的任何人都冷酷无情
More than anyone you know.

你错了 我认识一个杀手
You're wrong. I know a killer.

一个真正的杀手  所以呢？
A real killer. That so?

你在他面前就是个渣
You'd be like a kitten to him.

他动一动小手指就能让你毙命
He'd kill you with his little finger.

那人是他么？
That him?

不是  很好
No. Good.

别杀他
Don't kill him.

求你了
Please.

求你别动手
Please don't.

你很善良
You're very kind.

总有一天你的善心会葬送你的性命
Someday it'll get you killed.

我们到哪儿了？
Where are we?

我猜是赠地
The Gift, I think.

“筑城者”布兰登将这片土地
Brandon the Builder gave all this land

赠予了守夜人
south of the Wall to the Night's Watch

以维持生计
for their sustenance and support.

布兰・史塔克

鲁温学士教过我这些
Maester Luwin taught me that.

玖健・黎德
拥有绿之视野的男孩

如今这里渺无人烟
Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.

梅拉・黎德

这是块好地方 也没有战乱
It's good land and there's no war up here.

可人们为什么要离开？
Why leave?

因为野人
Wildlings.

欧莎
布兰与瑞肯的保护者

得罪了
Sorry.

他们从长城过来 进行掠夺
But they come over the Wall and raid,

偷盗 抢掳妇孺
steal, carry off women.

瑞肯・史塔克

老奶妈说他们会把你的头骨当杯子
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup

强迫你从里面饮下自己的鲜血
and make you drink your own blood from it.

老奶妈就是那么说的
That's what Old Nan said.

风暴要降临了
There's a storm coming.

我并没有感觉到… 
I don't see any

阿多
临冬城的马僮

这是一个很好的庇护地
It's as good a place to shelter as any.

我们在休息的时候可以喝点血
We can drink some blood while we wait.

我可不需要很多
I don't need much.

托蒙德
“巨人克星” 野人掠袭者

欧瑞尔
“鹰眼” 易形者

只有一个老人和八匹好马
Only one old man and eight good horses.

一个老人拿八匹马做什么？
What's one old man doing with eight horses?

琼恩・雪诺
叛逃的乌鸦

他为守夜人饲养这些马
He breeds them for the Watch.

耶哥蕊特
“火吻而生” 野人

他如何防止当地人偷马？
How's he keep folks from stealing them?

守夜人会保护他的
The Watch protects him.

如今不会了
Not today they don't.

他正在卖马 他那里有些金子
He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.

还有好的铁器  我们去宰了他
And proper steel. Let's carve him up.

我们只要牵走那些马就够了
We just take the horses and go.

这个老人构不成威胁
The old man's no threat.

我早跟你说过了
I keep telling you.

他是个老人
He's an old man.

一枪贯穿他的心脏
A spear through the heart's a better way to die

可比独自苟延残喘 除了几匹马外无人相伴要好多了
than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.

守夜人有可能会派几个人来预防偷马的人
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.

他们会派更多的人来抓捕杀人犯
They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

我倒希望这样
I hope so.

在城堡里杀他们很困难
Killing crows in their castle is tough.

在这种空旷的场地杀死他们
Killing them out here in the open,

却是我们擅长的
that's what we do.

分开行动
Spread out.

包围这小屋再进去
Surround the hut and move in.

耶哥蕊特！
Ygritte!

把马棚里的马都牵走！
Clear the barn!

你把这些猪肉都吃了 就装不成猪农了
No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.

这可是最美味的部位
Best part of the animal.

别担心 他们还在那儿
Don't worry. They're still there.

我知道他们还在那儿
I know they're still there.

你每五分钟查看一遍
You check every five minutes

难不成是怕他们走了么
like you're afraid they're gonna move.

我没有怕
I'm not afraid.

你怎么不怕
Of course you are.

你都快到那儿了
You're almost there,

你怕最后会做不到
and you're afraid you won't make it.

你离它越近 就越害怕
The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.

你没有必要掩饰
No point in trying to hide behind that face.

我见得太多了
I know fear when I see it.

一眼就能看出恐惧
Seen it a lot.

我看着你的时候就嗅出了恐惧
I knew fear when I saw it in you.

你害怕火
You're afraid of fire.

当贝里的剑引上火焰的时候
When Beric's sword went up in flames,

你看上去就像个吓坏了的小姑娘
you looked like a scared little girl.

而我知道这是为什么
And I know why, too.

我听说过你哥哥对你做的事
I heard what your brother did to you.

把你的脸按进火中
Pressed your face to the fire

就好像你是块美味多汁的羊腿
like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

你从这上面得到主意了？
That give you some ideas?

或许
Might do.

那就去吧
Go ahead, then.

你或许可以逃走
You might get away.

甚至可能一个人到那儿
Might even make it there on your own.

他们就在河对岸
They're just over the river.

这是自从伊林・派恩砍了你老爸的脑袋之后
The closest you've been to family

你离你家人最近的一次
since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

总有一天我要一剑捅进你的眼睛
Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye

一直捅到你的脑袋后面
and out the back of your skull.

你打算怎么通过长城？
How are we going to get past the Wall?

我叔叔说它有700尺高
My uncle said it's 700 feet high.

你是怎么过来的？
How did you get past it?

我坐上一条小船然后从海豹湾划过来的
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

我们要去海豹湾得花上两个月
It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.

有人则是直接爬过冰墙的
Some climb straight up the ice.

就算是阿多也没办法背着我爬长城
Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.

阿多
Hodor.

十九座城堡守卫着长城
19 castles guard the Wall.

现在只有三座还有人把守 阿多！
Only three are still manned. Hodor!

也许其中一座可以让我们通过
One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.

我叔叔说 城堡废弃时
My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone

会用冰和石头封门
when the castles were deserted.

那我们就把它们挖开
Well, we'll have to open them up again.

驾 驾 驾！ 那边有骑手
Whoa, whoa, whoa! There's a rider out there.

就一个？
Just one?

还有更多 阿多！
There's more. Hodor!

嘘 嘘
Shh. Shh.

闪电罢了 小巨人 阿多
It's just thunder, sweet giant. Hodor.

我投降
I yield.

我投降 是野人
I yield. Wildlings.

毛毛狗和夏天哪去了？
Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

捕猎去了
Hunting.

阿多！
Hodor!

嘘 安静 阿多 阿多！
Shh, quiet, Hodor. Hodor!

让他闭嘴 如果他们听到了… 
Make him shut up. If they hear us...

安静 阿多 不…  别再“阿多阿多”叫了 阿多！
Hush, Hodor. Nono more Hodoring. Hodor!

阿多！ 阿多 冷静
Hodor! Hodor, calm down.

你必须保持安静 他们会听到我们的
You need to keep quiet. They're gonna hear us.

阿多 安静
Hodor, be quiet.

啊！阿多！ 阿多 冷静
Ah! Hodor! Hodor, calm down.

阿多！阿多！ 阿多 安静！
Hodor! Hodor! Hodor, be quiet!

你做了什么？
What did you do?

没什么
Nothing.

我不知道
I don't know.

那是什么？
What's that?

那是一匹要死的马
That's a horse dying.

把他们带过来
Bring them over here.

这是最后一些了 其他的都死了
That was the last of them. The rest are dead.

我听到上面有叫声
I heard shouting up there.

那是打雷吧
Thunder.

我能分辨打雷和叫声的区别
I know the difference between shouting and thunder.

也许那是鬼魂
Maybe it's ghosts.

这帮不了你 老爷子
That won't help you, grandpa.

你要去哪？
Where you riding?

这已经不重要了 不是吗？
Doesn't matter now, does it?

的确 不重要了
No, it doesn't matter now.

杀了他 不然他会警告乌鸦们我们来了
Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.

你懂的
You understand.

至少让我站着死
Let me stand at least.

夏天
布兰・史塔克的冰原狼

毛毛狗
“毛毛” 瑞肯・史塔克的冰原狼

让我死得有尊严
Let me go with a bit of dignity.

让那个乌鸦去解决他
Make the crow kill him.

你现在是我们的人 证明你自己吧
You're one of us now. Prove it.

狼就在那
The wolves are out there.

我没法那么做
I can't do it by choice.

我不知道该怎么做 这种事只在我的梦里发生过
I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.

你是个狼灵 布兰
You're a warg, Bran.

这能力是与生俱来的
It's in your blood.

我做不到
I can't.

你刚才就对他做了
You just did with him.

一头狼跟这个比根本算不上什么
A wolf is nothing compared to that.

它看上去很锋利
She looks sharp.

动手
Do it.

快动手
Do it.

我跟你说过 他还是个乌鸦
I told you. He's still one of them.

动手啊 小子
Go on, boy.

动手！
Go on!

他是个乌鸦
He's a crow.

他始终是个乌鸦
He'll always be a crow.

现在他的乌鸦老婆还护着他
And here's his crow wife guarding him.

他一有机会就会对我们出手
He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.

杀了他
Kill him.

他是我们的人 不！
He's one of them. No!

你听见我的话了吗？
Do you hear me?

你不能为了一只乌鸦丧命的
You're not gonna die for one of them.

动手
Do it.

如果你不杀了他 他们会发现我们的
They'll find us if you don't.

你一直都是对的
You were right the whole time.



如果听到鸟叫 你就过来
When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come.

我口哨吹得很棒 这片大陆上最好的
I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land.

达里奥・纳哈里斯
Daario Naharis.

干掉他没费多长时间
That one was quick.

也许还有别人 我很怀疑
There may be others. I doubt it.

渊凯更愿意让他们的奴隶为他们作战
The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.

这就是你说的“几个守卫”？
That's what you call a few guards?

来啊！看你有啥本事 哈？
Come on! What do you got, huh?

萝丝琳・佛雷
瓦德・佛雷的女儿

艾德慕大人… 
Lord Edmure...

希望我没有让你失望
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

您是我的骄傲 小姐
You're a delight to me, my lady.

你现在可以为新娘披上斗篷
You may now cloak the bride

将她置于你的保护之下
and bring her under your protection.

在七神的见证下
In the sight of the Seven,

我在这里宣布这两个灵魂的结合
I hereby seal these two souls,

他们将永远联系在一起
binding them as one for eternity.

看着对方并说出誓言
Look upon each other and say the words.

天父 铁匠
Father, Smith,

战士 圣母
Warrior, Mother,

少女 老妪 陌客
Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

我属于她… 我属于他
I am hers... I am his...

她属于我… 他属于我…
and she is mine... and he is mine...

…从今往后 直到永远
...from this day until the end of my days.

安全了吗？ 他们早就走了
Is that safe? They're long gone.

你是对的
You were right.

只要我愿意 我随时能进入夏天
I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.

你当然可以
Of course you can.

长城以北也有野人
North of the Wall there are wildlings

可以控制各种动物
who can control all sorts of animals.

但是你比他们更厉害
But you did a lot more than that.

你能进入阿多
You got inside Hodor's mind.

在长城以北的人做不到吗？
They can't do that north of the Wall?

没人能做到…
No one can do that...

哪都没有
anywhere.

当我通过夏天的眼睛看出去时
When I was looking through Summer's eyes,

我看到琼恩了 哪里？
I saw Jon. Where?

他和野人在一起
He was with the wildlings.

他们试图杀了他 但是他逃走了
They tried to kill him, but he got away.

那他会回黑城堡去的
He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then.

那是他该去的地方
That's where we should go.

据我所知 黑城堡应该已经受到攻击了
For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack.

如果有这么多野人过来了的话…  我已经告诉过你了
If this many wildlings got throughI already told you.

我不去长城以北
I'm not going north of the Wall.

玖建告诉我的一切都是真的
Everything Jojen told me is true.

你看见我对阿多做了什么
You saw what I did to Hodor.

我必须找到三眼乌鸦
I have to find the threeeyed raven.

听我说 小主人
Listen to me, little lord.

别担心
Don't worry.

我没有要你跟我一起去
I'm not asking you to come with me.

那对瑞肯来说太危险了
It won't be safe for Rickon.

我？ 我跟你一起去
Me? I'm coming with you.

不
No.

你和欧莎还有毛毛狗去最后的壁炉城
You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.

安柏家是我们的封臣 他们会保护你们
The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.

我要和你一起去
I'm coming with you.

我是你的兄弟
I'm your brother.

我必须保护你
