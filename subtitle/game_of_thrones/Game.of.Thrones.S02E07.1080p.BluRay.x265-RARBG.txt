第二季第七集  A Man Without Honor
毁誉之人

一个残废？
A cripple?

席恩・葛雷乔伊
临冬城王子

你让一个残废逃跑了？
You let a cripple escape?

“裂颚”达格摩
铁民

那男孩走不了路
The boy can't walk,

就这么在你眼皮底下溜走了？
but somehow he slipped past you?

一定是那个巨人带着他
The giant must have took him.

那个巨人？
The giant?

阿多？
Hodor?

噢 妙 这就更妙了
Oh, well, that's all right, then.

你让一个弱智带着一个残废溜了
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

还有瑞肯吧？那个小不点
And Rickon, too? The little one?

都跟着那个女野人跑了
Gone along with the wildling woman,

你昨晚正忙着操她
the one you were fucking.

好了 备马 带上猎狗
Right, get the horses and the hounds.

快 找他们的气味
Come on, find the scent.

快 他们往哪走了？
Come on, where they going?

停！
Halt!

鲁温
临冬城学士

喜欢你的第一次狩猎吗？
Enjoying your first hunt?

大人 目前看来 狩猎跟骑马没什么两样
So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, My Lord.

只要追猎下去 最后都会见血
With hunting, there's blood at the end.

他们只是小孩
They're little boys.

当年我被人从家里抢走带到这里的时候
I was a little boy when I was torn away from

也只是个小孩
my home and brought here.

之后我谨遵誓言
So I kept my word.

从未逃离
I never ran away.

如果能够尽快找到他们 我就不动他们
If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.

好吧 可能我会动他们 但不会下杀手
Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

对你来说 那两个男孩活着比死了有用得多
Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.

但找不回来人 就什么用都没有
They have no value to me missing.

罗柏不久就会派人前来夺回临冬城
Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.

罗柏远在河间地 我姐姐近在深林堡
Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

她赶过来要快得多
She'll get here long before they do.

而奈德・史塔克常说 用五百人
And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold

就能把一万人挡在临冬城之外
Winterfell against 10,000.

有踪迹了！
We have a scent!

猎狗找到踪迹了
The hounds have the scent.

来吧 学士 别这么阴郁
Come, Maester, don't look so grim.

这不过是一场游戏
It's all just a game.

我们应该多带点食物
We should have took more food.

去厨房太冒险了
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

阿多
马僮

欧莎
女野人

瑞肯・史塔克


布兰・史塔克
临冬城代理城主

那些人都爱戴你
Those people all love you.

不论你需要什么 他们都会给的
They would have given you whatever you needed.

席恩发现之后 会把他们全部吊死
And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

小子 吃核桃填不饱肚子  别管我
The boy can't survive on walnuts. I'm fine.

天还没亮我们就动身了 一直到现在
We've been walking since before sunrise.

就算是阿多都会累  阿多
Even Hodor will tire. Hodor.

说你呢 可爱的巨人  阿多
Even you, sweet giant.  Hodor.

等一下 我知道这个农场
Wait, I know that farm.

我曾派过两个临冬城的孤儿到这儿来
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

杰克和比利
Jack and Billy.

他们会给我们食物的
They'll give us some food.

我们不能冒险
We can't risk it.

如果席恩搜到这里 他会拷问他们
If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them

直到问出我们的去向
until he finds out where we are.

比利能爬树呢 爬的比谁都好
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

小主人 那是因为你没见过我爬树
You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

他们会带着猎狗追踪我们
They'll be after us with hounds.

我们动身比他们早
We got a good start on them,

但还是摆脱不了猎狗
but we can't outrun hounds forever.

耶哥蕊特
野人 “火吻而生”

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人

你昨晚没用刀在我身上磨磨蹭蹭？
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

怎么了？
What's the matter?

你不是第一次把你的棒子
Can't be the first time you pressed your bone

顶在一个女人的屁股上吧
against a woman's ass.

我们走
Let's move.

噢 还真是第一次
Oh, it is the first time.

小子 你多大了？
How old are you, boy?

我是守夜人的汉子
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

你是个没碰过女人的小毛孩
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

你的卵蛋难道不疼吗？
Don't your stones start to hurt

如果你的棒子从来不
if your bone never gets

别这么叫它们
Don't call them that.

什么 卵蛋？
What, stones?

还是棒子？
Or bone?

都不是
Neither.

都是
Both.

走了！
Move!

我听说如果你不让它们发挥作用
I heard they get all swollen

就会肿胀发紫 有擦伤的可能
and bruised if you don't use them.

当然啦 可能只是那些家伙乱编的
Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say

他们想在我这博同情
when they want me feeling sorry for them.

然后就以为我真的会同情他们
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

你们那儿没有女乌鸦吗？
Are there no girl crows?

没有 守夜人里没有女人
There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

所以小伙子们就互相解决？
So the lads just do it with each other?

不
No.

从不？ 从不
Never? Never.

我们发过誓
We swore an oath.

长城上还有绵羊？
You have sheep at the Wall?

噢 那就是用手了？
With your hands, then?

难怪你们个个苦大仇深
No wonder you're all so miserable.

能不能请你闭嘴？
Would you please shut up?

能不能请你闭嘴？
Would you please shut up?

你觉得你比我高贵 乌鸦
You think you're better than me, crow.

我是个自由人  你是个自由人？
I'm a free woman  You're a free woman?

我可能是你的犯人 但我是个自由人
I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.

如果你是我的犯人 你就不是自由的
If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman.

这就是“犯人”的意思
That's what "prisoner" means.

那你觉得你是自由的？
And you think you're free?

你发了个愚蠢的誓
You swore some stupid oath

然后再也不能碰女人
and now you can never touch a girl.

我的誓言是我自愿选的
It was my choice to say the words.

你不喜欢女人？  我当然喜欢女人
So you don't like girls?   Of course I like girls.

但你选择了再也不碰她们
But you chose never to touch them.

要成为守夜人的汉子 这就是代价
That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

所以你宁愿放弃睡女人的自由
So instead of getting naked with a girl,

跑来侵略我们的地盘
you'd prefer to invade our lands

侵略你们的地盘？
Invade your lands?

是野人一直进犯我们的领地
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

有几个还曾想杀掉我的小弟 一个残废的男孩！
Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!

那不是你们的领地！
They're not your lands!

从古至今 我们一直都在这儿
We've been here the whole time.

是你们擅自跑过来 建起一堵大墙
You lot came along and just put up a big wall

说地是你们的
and said it was yours.

我的父亲乃是奈德・史塔克
My father was Ned Stark.

我身上流着先民的血液
I have the blood of the First Men.

我的祖先们住在这里 和你的祖先一样
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

那你们为什么还要来攻打我们？
So why are you fighting us?

继续啊
Go on.

来跟我说说到底发生了什么
Now I want you to tell me what happened.

来 这边走
Come on, this way.

来来 大点声 大点声
Come on, speak up. Speak up.

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 西境守护

附子草
Wolfsbane

这东西很罕见
a rare substance.

这不是一个普通刺客
This is no common assassin.

我们昨晚吊死了二十个人
We hanged 20 men last night.

你们吊死一百个我也不管
I don't care if you hanged 100.

有人想杀了我
A man tried to kill me.

我只要他的名字 和他的脑袋
I want his name and I want his head.

我们觉得可能是无旗兄弟会
We think it was an infiltrator

格雷果・克里冈
“魔山”

派来的奸细
from the Brotherhood Without Banners.

这群土匪起名字还真是自命不凡
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

我们决不能容忍眼皮子底下有人作乱
We can't allow rebels behind our lines

频频滋扰却不能得到惩治
to harass us with impunity.

我们像是傻子 他们却好像英雄
We look like fools and they look like heroes.

国王都是这么被推翻的
That's how kings fall.

我要你全部清理干净
I want them dead, every one.

杀了他们不难
Killing them isn't the problem.

怎么找到才是难事
It's finding them.

克里冈 你变软弱了吗？
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

我一直视你为天生的猛夫
I always thought you had a talent for violence.

烧村子 毁田地
Burn the villages, burn the farms.

让他们知道选错阵营意味着什么
Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.

嗯
Mmm.

“阿利”
艾莉亚・史塔克 泰温的侍酒

那是羊肉？
Is that mutton?

是的 大人
Yes, My Lord.

我不喜欢羊肉
Don't like mutton.

我马上拿其他食物过来
I'll bring something else.

放着吧
Leave it.

你饿了吗？ 没有
Are you hungry? No.

你肯定饿了
Of course you are.

吃吧
Eat.

我一会去厨房吃
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

拒绝领主的赏赐 太没规矩了
It's bad manners to refuse a Lord's offer.

坐
Sit.

吃
Eat.

以年龄来说 你个子小了点
You're small for your age.

一定从小到大都没吃饱过
I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.

我吃的可多了
I eat a lot.

只是不长个  嗯
I just don't grow. Hmm.

这会是我的最后一场战争
This will be my last war,

输赢成败 在此一举
win or lose.

你以前输过吗？
Have you ever lost before?

如果曾经输过 你觉得我还能坐在现在的位子上吗？
Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?

但这场战争才会令我铭记于史
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

他们叫它“五王之战”
The "War of Five Kings"they're calling it.

接下来的几个月 将铸就我的传奇
My legacy will be determined in the coming months.

你知道传说的意思吗？
Do you know what legacy means?

就是你会教给孩子
It's what you pass down to your children

一代又一代传下去的东西
and your children's children.

只有它们能在你死后流传下去
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

“黑心”赫伦以为这座城堡会是他的传奇
Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.

这座古往今来最雄伟的要塞
The greatest fortress ever built

最高耸的塔楼 最坚固的城墙
the tallest towers, the strongest walls.

大厅里曾有三十五个壁炉
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

三十五个 你能想象吗？
35. Can you imagine?

现在你看看它
Look at it now

满目疮痍
a blasted ruin.

你知道发生过什么吗？
Do you know what happened?

龙？
Dragons?

对 龙来了
Yes, dragons happened.

赫伦堡建立之初只考虑防御陆上的威胁
Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.

即便是百万雄师来袭
A million men could have marched on these walls

也无法撼动它半分
and a million men would have been repelled.

但遇上从空中来袭的龙焰 嗯
But an attack from the air with dragon firemm.

赫伦和他所有的儿子都在城里被活活烧死
Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.

伊耿・坦格利安改写了规则
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

所以直至今日 在他死去三百年后
That's why every child alive still knows his name

世上每个小孩仍然知晓他的大名
300 years after his death.

伊耿和他的妹妹们
Aegon and his sisters.

嗯？
Mm?

骑龙而来的不止是伊耿
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

还有雷妮丝和维桑妮亚
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

对
Correct.

看来学过不少历史 是么？
A student of history,are you?

雷妮丝骑着米拉西斯
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

而维桑尼亚骑着瓦格哈尔
Visenya rode Vhagar.

我打小就知道这些
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

维桑尼亚・坦格利安是个伟大的女战士
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

她有一把瓦雷利亚钢剑叫黑暗姐妹
She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.

嗯
Hmm.

她是你心目中的英雄 对不对？
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

大部分女孩不是更爱把自己幻想成
Aren't most girls more interested

那些歌谣中的美丽少女？
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

头上缀满鲜花的琼琪？
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

那些女孩都是傻子  哈！
Most girls are idiots.  Ha!

你让我想起了我女儿
You remind me of my daughter.

谁教你的这些
Where did you learn all this stuff

关于维桑尼亚和她的黑暗姐妹？
about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword?

我父亲
From my father.

他是个满腹经纶的石匠
He was a wellread stonemason.

还别说我还真见过教养不错的石匠
Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

你见过不少石匠吗 大人？
Have you met many stonemasons, My Lord?

注意点 姑娘
Careful now, girl.

我喜欢你 但你也要注意分寸
I enjoy you,but be careful.

把那端回厨房去
Take that back to the kitchen.

爱吃什么就吃什么
Eat what you want.

还有 姑娘
And, girl.

老爷
M'lord.

出身差的女孩只会叫“老爷”
Lowborn girls say "M'lord,"

而不是“大人”
not "My Lord."

你要装个底层人
If you're going to pose as a commoner,

就该装得像点
you should do it properly.

我母亲曾侍奉
My mother served Lady Dustin

达斯丁夫人多年  大人
for many years,My Lord.

她教我要遵守礼 礼貌
She taught me how to speak properproperly.

为你自己好就别装的太聪明
You're too smart for your own good.

有人告诉过你吗？  有的
Has anyone told you that?  Yes.

下去吧
Go on.

珊莎・史塔克
乔佛里的未婚妻

对不起 爵士
I beg pardon, Ser.

我想我事后该去找你
I should have come to you after

当面向你感谢救命之恩
to thank you for saving me.

你真勇敢  勇敢？
You were so brave.  Brave?

桑铎・克里冈
御林铁卫 “猎狗”

狗追老鼠需要什么勇敢
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

恐吓别人会带给您乐趣吗？
Does it give you joy to scare people?

不 杀人才带给我乐趣
No. It gives me joy to kill people.

拜托 别告诉我说
Spare me.You can't tell me

临冬城的艾德・史塔克公爵从没杀过人啊
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.

他只是履行责任  从未以此为乐
It was his duty.He never liked it.

他是这么告诉你的？
Is that what he told you?

他骗你呢
He lied.

杀戮才是世上最美好的事
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

你为何总是这么可恶？
Why are you always so hateful?

你早晚会成为王后
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do

那时你就会感激我的可恶之处
someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands

因为那是唯一能挡在你和你深爱的国王之间的了
between you and your beloved king.

我已经召集十三巨子前来与你会面
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.

就是他们其中之一所为 或者他们知道是谁所为
One of them did this or knows who did.

你也是其中之一
You are one of the Thirteen.

如果我要你的龙  早就拿走了
If I wanted your dragons,I would have taken them.

札罗・赞旺・达梭斯
魁尔斯“十三巨子”之一

单单拿走它们对我而言毫无意义  毫无意义？
They mean nothing to me on their own.  Nothing?

它们远比世上任何一样东西都更重要
They're more valuable than anything in the world.

是不是要去我的地下室看看
Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
风暴降生 龙之母

世上还有什么 是我卖了你的龙才能买来的？
would buy me I cannot buy already?

我们会找回它们的
We will get them back.

根本没有什么“我们”
There is no we,

你为什么要帮我把它们找回来？
so why would you help me get them back?

我在我的地盘上
I took you under my protection

当着大家的面赌誓保护你
in front of the rulers of my city.

众口铄金
A man is what others say he is and no more.

如果大家都说札罗・赞旺・达梭斯是个骗子
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

那我的话就一文不值了
my word is worth nothing.

我不能让你在我眼皮子底下出事
I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.

但这事就发生在你眼皮子底下
But it did happen under your roof.

卡丽熙 我一生经历过无数次
Khaleesi, many times in my life I have been

我才不管你经历过什么
I don't care where you've been.

因为不住在石头城堡里 你就认为我们是野蛮人
You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.

我们打的铁没你们的好 这个没错 但是…
We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but...

我们拥有自由
We're free.

如果有人要告诉我们
If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down

男人和女人不该躺在一起
as man and woman,

我们会朝他屁眼里插根矛
we'd shove a spear up his ass.

靠继承老爹王位而来的狗屁国王
We don't go serving some shit king

我们才不要服从
who's only king because his father was.

不 不 你们服从曼斯・雷德
No. No, you serve Mance Rayder,

塞外之王
the KingBeyondtheWall.

曼斯・雷德是我们推举出来的领袖
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

他原来是个乌鸦 和你一样
He was a crow,same as you,

但他向往自由
but he wanted to be free.

你也可以自由的
You could be free, too.

你不需要浪费一辈子
You don't need to live your whole life

去听从老头子的命令
taking commands from old men.

睡觉睡到自然醒
Wake up when you want to wake up.

我还可以带你到溪流里钓鱼 到森林里捕猎
I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt.

自己建个木屋 找个女人一起过夜
Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.

你长得还不错
You're a pretty lad.

女孩子们会为了上你一回而互相挖眼珠子
The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.

快走
Walk.

我可以教你怎么做
I could teach you how to do it.

我知道怎么做
I know how to do it.

你什么也不懂 琼恩・雪诺
You know nothing,Jon Snow.

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

她怎么说？
And what did she say?

阿尔顿・兰尼斯特
信使 瑟曦和詹姆的堂弟

她钦佩您的勇气 陛下
She admired your spirit,Your Grace.

然后呢？
And what then?

她 呃…
She, uh...

如果每个人都要
If every man were held accountable

为自己每一个远亲的举动负责
for the actions of every distant relative,

那我们都该被绞死了 阿尔顿爵士
Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

她把协议撕成两半了 陛下
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

非常感谢
You've acted with honor.

你能如实相告
I thank you for it.

卡史塔克大人 替阿尔顿爵士打扫下牢房
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean.

再给他一顿热饭
And give him a hot supper.

阿尔顿爵士的牢房被占了 陛下
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

都是黄叉河的囚犯
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

瑞卡德・卡史塔克
卡霍城伯爵

囚犯太多了
Too many prisoners.

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡伯爵

那还有地方给阿尔顿爵士吗？
Is there room for Ser Alton?

他需要躺着吗？
Does he need to lie down?

找人手给他搭间新牢房
Have the men build him a new pen.

搭好之前先让他和弑君者住一起
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

让你儿子看好他们
Have your boy watch over them.

瑞卡德伯爵之子

Torrhen.

就这样吧
That will be all.

陛下
Your Grace.

能找您说句话吗？
A minute of your time?

泰丽莎

瓦兰提斯女护士

我替您治疗了受伤的手下
I've been treating your wounded men.

还有我的敌人
And my enemies as some of my bannermen

我的封臣们老是提到这些
are fond of mentioning.

他们不是我的敌人
They're not my enemies.

我也是这么和他们说的
That's what I tell my bannermen.

我已经把带来的补给用光了
I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.

有些很容易补充
Some are easily replaced

蛋黄 松脂 玫瑰精油
egg yolks, turpentine,oil of roses.

但有些就难办了
But some are not.

我需要丝线来缝合
I need silk for stitching.

我需要茴香根来治疗热病 还有柳树皮
I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark.

最急需的还是罂粟花奶
Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

你也看见了 不麻醉就截肢会怎样
You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.

战事结束之前
I assume there will be more loss of limb before

必然还有更多截肢要做
this war is over.

如果你需要有人帮你去找  我知道上哪找
If you need help finding these I know where to find them.

对不起 我不该打断你
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

说下去 小姐
Continue, My Lady.

你正要去峭岩城招降？
You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?

是的
Yes.

峭岩城\h西境城堡

峭岩城会有位学士 他会有我需要的东西
The Crag will have a Maester and he will have what I need.

我想应该是
I expect he will.

如果我列张单子
If I could write a list

和我一起去峭岩城吧
come with me to the Crag.

我觉得那样不
I don't think that will be

让学士给你看看他的藏货
Let the Maester show you his stores.

我想让伤员都能好好治疗
I want the wounded men to be treated well

所有的伤员
all the wounded men.

孩子们 都进来 快
Children, come inside, quick.

快点
Hurry up!

什么也找不到 爵士
Can't find anything, Ser.

跟丢了  再找一遍
They've lost the scent.  Try again.

我们绕着这磨坊两圈了
We've circled this farmhouse twice.

没有他们的迹象
There's no sign of them.

我们可以明天一大早组织搜索 大人
We could start the search fresh in the morning, My Lord.

难道我要一辈子都被
I'm looking at spending the rest of life

自己的手下耻笑是个傻子和阉货吗？
being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.

你扪心自问 “当初有没有竭尽全力
Ask yourself, "Is there anything I wouldn't do

避免这一切的发生？”
to stop that from happening?"

狗儿们会再找到气息的
The hounds will find the scent again.

找不到我就一直抽打它们
I'll beat them until they do.

我会鞭打这儿所有的人
I'll whip every man here

直到亲手抓住那两个小家伙
until I have both those boys in hand.

一旦我抓住他们 那两个养尊处优的小王八蛋…
And once I've got them,the pampered little shits...

暴君总比软蛋好听
It's better to be cruel than weak.

席恩王子
Prince Theon.

他们在哪？  谁 老爷？
Where are they?  Who, m'lord?

史塔克家的小屁孩 他们在哪？
The Stark boys.Where are they?

我不知道 我谁都没看见
I don't know.I seen no one.

好好想想
Think harder.

我发誓 老爷 我不知道
I swear, m'lord,I don't know.

大人 这边
My Lord, over here.

我想我已经找到了
I think I've found what we're looking for.

带老头子回去
Send the old man home.

回临冬城
Go back to Winterfell.

带他回去
Take him back.

席恩 别这样
Theon, don't do this.

你回来了
You came back.

一听见消息就回来了
As soon as I heard.

你知道什么吗？
Do you know anything?

伊丽死了  我听说了
Irri is dead.  I know.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
熊老之子 “大熊”

她是个好  她死了
She was a good she's dead.

她孤零零的死了
She died alone.

她为我而死 我却没能保护她
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

多莉亚呢？
Doreah?

我们找不到她
We can't find her.

她一定也死了
She must be dead, too.

我把我的子民们带出了红色荒原
I led my people out of the Red Waste

却又带进了屠宰场
and into the slaughterhouse.

我本该守在这里
I should have been here.

你是为了替我找船
You went to find me a ship.

我的职责是守护在你身边
My place is by your side.

我不该把你留给这群人的
I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.

这群人？
These people?

他们不值得相信
They are not to be trusted.

那谁值得信任？
And who is to be trusted?

谁是我的人？
Who are my people?

坦格利安家的人么？
The Targaryens?

我只认识一个 就是我哥哥
I only knew onemy brother,

而他情愿让一千个人上了我
and he would have let 1,000 men rape me

只要能给他戴上王冠
if it had got him the crown.

多斯拉克人？
The Dothraki?

卓戈卡奥从马上摔下来的那天
Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo

他们绝大多数都背叛了我
fell from his horse.

您的子民在维斯特洛
Your people are in Westeros.

维斯特洛人还不知道我活着
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

他们马上就会知道  接下来呢？
They will soon enough.  And then what?

他们会祈祷我的回归？
They'll pray for my return?

他们会挥舞着龙旗 呼喊着我的名字？
They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name?

我哥哥才相信这些鬼话 他是个傻瓜
That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.

你不是你哥哥
You are not your brother.

相信我 卡丽熙
Trust me, Khaleesi.

又是这套
There it is

“相信我”
"trust me."

我应该相信你 乔拉爵士？
And it's you I should trust,Ser Jorah?

只有你？
Only you?

我再也不要信谁了
I don't need trust any longer.

我不想要 也不需要信任谁
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

你还太年轻 不该这么
You are too young to be so

而你却经验丰富
And you are too familiar.

恕我直言 卡丽熙
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

这世上 没人能独立生存
No one can survive in this world without help.

没人
No one.

请让我来帮助您 求你
Let me help you, please.

命令我吧
Tell me how.

去找我的龙
Find my dragons.

还要多久才能找到你的乌鸦队伍？
How long till we get back to your crows?

就快到了
We're close.

是么 一天？还是半天？
What, a day? A halfday?

其实你也不知道 不是么？
You don't know, do you?

你连他们在哪都不知道吧  就快到了
Do you even know where they are? We're close.

你觉得他们会如何评价咱俩的事情？
What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?

咱俩之间什么也没发生
Nothing happened between you and me.

我发誓 老乌鸦大人
"I swear it, old master king crow, Ser,

我们只是靠在一起取暖而已
we were only close together for warmth.

然后我觉得
And then I felt it,

有个棍子一样的东西顶着我的屁股
right up against me backside like a club.

您看看 我的尾骨都被它挫伤了
I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

我还没弄清楚那究竟是什么呢 他 他
And before I knew what was where, hishis

他的那话儿完全漏在外面 怒气勃发
well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.

我本来忍着想要拒绝 可是 哦 我真是情不自禁
And I didn't want to want it, but, oh, I did!

接着他分开我的双腿 一切都完了
And he spread me legs andruined.

真丢人啊
The shame of it.

现在我再也无法嫁给一位香喷喷的领主大人了
Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.

我那可怜的野人老爹会怎么说呢
What will me poor savage father say?"

转过身去
Turn back around.

当我以为事情结束了的时候 他却说
"And I thought that we were done, but he said,

转过身去
'Turn back around.'"

我告诉你 琼恩・雪诺
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

从我们用剑互砍的时候开始
since it's going to be your word against mine,

从你每次跟我说话就脸红开始
and since you can't talk about it without blushing,

我们就应该像刚才说的那样
we may as well just.

什么 就在这烂泥地上？
What, right here in the muck?

我会为你取暖
I'll keep you warm enough.

你就这么害怕？
Are you that afraid of it?

够了
That's enough.

很美妙的
Oh, it's nice

又湿又暖
and wet and warm.

够了
Enough

我下面可不会咬人
it don't have teeth.

好吧
All right!

好吧
All right.

神啊 你可真迟钝
Gods, you're dull.

你早该抓住机会要我的
Should have took me while you had the chance.

不 不要！
No, no!

不 不要
No. Oh, no.

雪伊
珊莎的侍女

没事的 给我
It's all right.Give me that.

如果被太后知道我已经可以为乔佛里生孩子…
If the queen sees I can have Joffrey's children now...

帮我把它翻过来
Help me flip it over.

你去哪儿  去告诉太后
Where are you going? To tell her Grace.

你永远不会告诉任何人
You'll say nothing to anyone.

明白吗
Do you understand?

你母亲应该早就教过你
Your mother might have prepared you.

你成人了 亲爱的 仅此而已
You flowered, my dear.No more.

我母亲是说过 但是我没想到会是这样
My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.

会是哪样？
In what way?

我以为不会这么
I thought it would be less

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

这么脏乱
less messy.

等生孩子的时候你就知道了
Wait until you bear the child.

你是个女人了
You're a woman now.

你知道这意味着什么吗？
Do you have any idea what that means?

我可以为国王生育了？
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

为国王诞下小王子和小公主
A prospect that once delighted you

这可是你期待已久的事情
bringing little princes and princesses into the world,

这是身为王后的最高荣誉
the greatest honor for a queen.

乔佛里一直很难伺候
Joffrey has always been difficult.

从他出生就是如此
Even his birth,I labored a day and a half

我用了一天半的时间才生下他
to bring him into this world.

你根本无法想象那有多疼
You cannot imagine the pain.

毫无疑问 劳勃在御林都能听见
I screamed so loudly, I was sure

我声嘶力竭的喊叫
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

陛下当时没有跟您在一起吗？
His Grace was not with you?

劳勃去打猎了
Robert was hunting.

他一贯如此
That was his custom.

每次我临近产期
Whenever my time was near,

我尊贵的丈夫就带着他的猎人和猎狗
my royal husband would flee to the trees

躲在树林里玩乐
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

归来时 他会向我展示些
And when he returned, he would present me

皮毛 鹿头什么的
with some pelts or a stag's head,

而我 则给他一个婴儿
and I would present him with a baby.

不过必须声明 我也不想他在身边
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

我有派席尔大学士和一队助产士
I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives,

还有我弟弟
and I had my brother.

他们告诉詹姆不能进产房
When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

他只是微笑着问道
he smiled and asked which one of them

你们有谁敢阻拦？
proposed to keep him out.

乔佛里可不会对你投入这么多感情
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

你也许永远不会爱上国王
You may never love the king,

但是你会爱上他的孩子
but you will love his children.

我全心全意地爱着陛下
I love his Grace with all my heart.

这话听着真感人
That's so very touching to hear.

既然今天如此特殊
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you

我愿意跟你分享一些女人的智慧
on this very special day.

爱的人越多 你就越脆弱
The more people you love, the weaker you are.

你会为了他们而冒天下之大不韪
You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.

只要他们能够平安快乐 就算像个傻瓜也在所不惜
You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.

除了你的孩子 谁都不要真心去爱
Love no one but your children.

在这方面 作为母亲别无选择
On that front, a mother has no choice.

但是…难道我不该爱乔佛里吗 陛下？
But... shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

你可以试试
You can try,

小白鸽
little dove.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 “弑君者”

你刚才说你妈是谁来着？
Who did you say your mother was again?

辛达・兰尼斯特
Cinda Lannister.

特肥的那个？
Is she the fat one?

呃 也许她是比别人大那么一点点
Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she

不 不 兰尼斯特家只有一个胖子
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

如果她是你妈 你就应该知道这个
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

我 我当过一次您的侍从 记得吗？
II squired for you once, you know?

什么时候？
When?

在威廉・弗雷婚礼的比武大会上
The tournament the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

我去过威廉・弗雷的婚礼？
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

是的
You did.

您的侍从在前一晚喝的烂醉如泥
Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he

他在去比赛场地时
He threw up on his horse

从马背上摔了下来
on the way to the tourney grounds.

他叫什么来着？布莱恩
What was his name? Bryan.

可怜的孩子
Poor lad.

我弟弟干得好事 我好像有点印象了
That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.

我记得你
I remember you.

之前你根本没有做过侍从
You had never squired for anyone before.

是的 我跑去主动请缨
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.

让我来吧 大人 让我来吧
"Let me, My Lord. Let me."

我父亲当时反应非常激烈
My father was furious,

生怕我会在整个家族面前
afraid I'd embarrass our family

令自家蒙羞
in front of the family.

你可没有
You didn't, though.

您真的记得？  嗯
You really remember? Mm.

你知道什么时候该出现 什么时候又该消失
You knew when you were needed and when to go away.

这可是少有的天赋
It's a rare talent.

我的其他侍从 他们的出发点是好的
Most of my squires, they mean well,

但心比天高的年轻人 总是做的太过
but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.

每当我回想起来
Well, when I think back to that day

你说什么？
You were saying?

我
I

算了 这可真尴尬
never mind. It's embarrassing.

难道还能比栓在沾满自己大便的栏杆上
More embarrassing than being chained to a post

更尴尬吗？
covered in your own shit?

那天的事情我仍历历在目
I remember everything about that day

您的头盔 您的战马
your helmet, your horse,

就在栅栏旁泥地上的标线
the rake line in the dirt along the list,

您把巴隆・史文爵士敲下马
where the sun was in the sky

太阳正在天空照耀
when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

当您把盾牌交给我时 我还清晰的记得那上面的凹痕
and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.

这些事情我都至死难忘
I'll remember it all until I die.

那是我人生中最棒的一天
That was the best day of my life.

我还记得在比赛结束后我仍站在场上
And I remember being on the field after it was over.

所有的参赛者都回去了
All the competitors were done.

我是最后一个留在那里的
I was the last one out there.

我无法离开
And I couldn't leave.

我无法回去和家人坐在一起
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family

回到宴席之中的那张
at a table so far on the edge of the feast

几乎看不到新娘的偏僻的小桌旁
you could barely even see the bride.

我无法告诉他们做你的侍从究竟是什么感觉
And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you

因为他们对我所说的一切
when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea

根本一无所知
what I was talking about.

我完全理解
I understand completely.

您怎么能？
How could you?

对 对不起 我 我没有 怀疑您的意思
Ssorry, II didn't mean to doubt you.

我只是 我  我也曾有过十六岁
It's just that II was 16 once.

我也曾临时代人去做某人的侍从
I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.

是哪位骑士？
Which knight was it?

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
Barristan Selmy.

那是一场对抗御林兄弟会的战斗
The fight against the Kingswood outlaws.

那时候还没你呢
Before your time.

他是怎样的人？
What was he like?

他是个
He was

画家
a painter,

只用红墨作画
a painter who only used red.

我简直难以想象自己能像他那样战斗
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,

起码当时不行
not back then.

甚至连为他的完美杰作锦上添花
And to help him do that, to be a part of something

都很困难…
that perfect...

我无须向你描述那种感觉
I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.

那实在是难以言喻
It's hard to put into words.

就像步入一个梦境
It's like stepping into a dream

一个你从记事起就从未停止幻想的梦境
you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember

并且发现它甚至
and finding out that the dream

比自己的生命更真实
is more real than your life.

离开那个战场之后
Leaving that battlefield was

日子天天像坐牢一样难受
like being dragged off to prison.

您后来还有给他当侍从的机会吗？没有
Did you squire for him again? No.

我并没有你那样的天赋
I didn't have your gift.

后来我糟糕的服侍让他寸步难行
He couldn't take a step without stepping on me.

糟糕透顶 我得为此负全责
I was awful, a complete liability...

直到有一个御林土匪
until one of the outlaws

决定挑战一个十六岁的侍从
decided to take on a 16yearold squire.

这也不错 我就是我
It's a good thing I am who I am.

在别的方面我一直很没用
I'd have been useless at anything else.

我可不适合当俘虏
I'm not wellsuited for imprisonment.

震惊吧 我就知道
Shocking, I know.

可有的人适合
Some men are.

奈德・史塔克 我觉得他
Ned StarkI imagine he made

到死都是个称职的俘虏
an excellent prisoner right up until the end.

而我嘛 我生来就不该
But me, thoughmy life has left me

受到任何约束
uniquely unfit for constraint.

你有没有想过…？
Have you thought about...?

当然
Of course.

每天都想  然后？
Every day.And?

显然 犯人态度良好的话狱卒当然也不会差
Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.

史塔克们非常小心
The Starks are very careful.

但我相信 总会有办法的
But there is a way, I think.

现在终于有机会了
It wasn't possible until now.

什么机会？
What is it?

其实很简单  那我来帮你
It's actually quite simple. Well, let me help you.

你只需要做一件事
You'll only have to do one thing.

告诉我
Tell me.

你只需要 去死
You'll have to die.

安达尔人乔拉
Jorah the Andal.

这个人必须出海渡过古瓦雷利亚
This man must sail past old Valyria.

每个走近末日遗迹的人都需要保护
All who travel too close to the Doom must have protection.

魁晰
女巫

我不是来这里听你念叨的
I didn't come here for lessons.

确实 你是来找龙的
No, you came for the dragons.

你有？
You have them?

他们在哪儿？
Where are they?

亮出你的剑
Draw your sword.

看看这块破铁管什么用
See what your steel is worth.

你想要取悦龙之母
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

你爱她
You love her.

龙在哪儿？
Where are the dragons?

你会再次背叛她吗 安达尔人乔拉
Will you betray her again,Jorah the Andal?

你会再次背叛她吗？
Will you betray her again?

绝不
Never.

你所追查的窃贼
The thief you seek

此刻正在她身边
is with her now.

我离开自己舒适的居所来到您堂前
I did not leave the comfort of my home

香料之王
魁尔斯“十三巨子”之一

可不是让你当我是个贼的
to come to yours and be called a thief.

没人说你是窃贼啊
No one is calling you a thief.

那她指控我什么呢？
Who is she to accuse us?

求您 他们是我的孩子啊
Please, they're my children.

我恳求你们 恳求我们？
I'm begging you. Begging us?

你不久之前才刚刚威胁过我们
It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.

没有我在身边 小龙们会死的
Without me, the dragons will die.

那样再好不过了
It will be for the best.

你的龙只会为这个世界带来死亡和悲惨
Your dragons will bring the world

别无它物啊 亲爱的女士
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

即便我知道它们在哪里 也不会告诉你
If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.

你太残忍了 我的朋友
You are cruel, my friend.

龙之母应当和她的孩子们重新团聚
The mother of dragons is in the right.

俳雅・菩厉
男巫

这可是天经地义的啊
She must be reunited with her babies.

我会帮助您的 卡丽熙  怎么帮？
I will help you, Khaleesi. How?

我会带您去不朽之殿
I will take you to the House of the Undying

小龙们就被我放在那里
where I have put them.

我的龙在你那儿？
You have my dragons?

当得知您正赶往我们的城市时
When I learned you were coming to our city,

我便同魁尔斯之王达成了协议
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

他帮我得到了那些小龙
He procured them for me.

但魁尔斯并没有王啊  现在有了
But there is no King of Qarth. There is now.

那就是协议的另一半
That was the other half of the arrangement.

你们选择紧闭城门
You would keep your gates and your minds closed

对墙外之事不闻不问
to everything outside your walls,

科瓦罗
血盟卫

可是如果魁尔斯拒绝改变的话
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was

它怎能作为古往今来最伟大的城市长存
if it refuses to change.

我会为整个世界敞开魁尔斯之门
I will open Qarth to the world

正如我曾经强迫它对我敞开一样
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

你的雄心壮志听起来倒是振奋人心
Your ambition is an inspiration.

可惜和其他暴发户一样 你狂妄过头了
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

三只猫咪大小的龙
Three dragons the size of cats

再加上与牛鬼蛇神结为同盟
and an alliance with a charlatan

靠这些你就想成为王？
do not make you a king.

暴发户和牛鬼蛇神？
An upstart and a charlatan?

帝国的缔造者往往比这更加微不足道
Empires have been built by less.

圈外的人不时插足权势中心
Those on the margins often come to control the center,

而中心的人就得腾出位子
and those in the center make room for them,

不管他情愿不情愿
willingly or otherwise.

龙之母将会同她的孩子们在一起
The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.

她会付出她的爱
She will give them her love

而它们将在她的身边茁壮成长
and they will thrive by her side...

永不分离
forever.

母亲应当同她的孩子在一起
A mother should be with her children.

风暴降生的丹妮莉丝 您这是要去哪儿？
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

您的小龙们都在不朽之殿等着呢
Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.

来找他们吧
Come see them.

史塔克夫人！ 不许再靠前
Lady Stark! No farther.

把手拿开 女人
Keep your hands off me, woman.

别不请自来 男人
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

塔斯的布蕾妮
凯特琳的护卫

请您见谅 史塔克夫人
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

怎么了？  他们抓到了弑君者
What is it? They caught the Kingslayer.

凯特琳・徒利
史塔克夫人

宰了这混蛋弑君者！  吊死他！
Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!

你今天就得死
You'll die today.

为卡史塔克讨回公道
Justice for the Karstark.

给他开肠破肚！

卡史塔克大人
Lord Karstark,

此人是我们的囚犯
this man is our prisoner.

这个怪物杀了我儿子
This monster killed my son.

他也害我儿成了残废
And crippled mine.

他会为自己的罪孽付出代价的
He will answer for his crimes,

我向你保证 但不是在这里
I promise you, but not here.

我要砍他的脑袋 如果您想要阻止我的话
I will have his head. And if you try and stop me

你就连我一起砍？
You will strike me down?

你忘记我是谁了吗 爵士？
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

Threatening My Lady is an act of treason.

Treason?

How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

我理解你的悲伤 大人
I understand your grief, My Lord

我比任何人都更加理解
better than most I understand it

但是以吾儿之名 以北境之王之名
but in the name of my son, the King in the North,

罢手吧
stand down.

您儿子回来时
When your son returns,

我会向他索要这个凶手的脑袋
I will demand this murderer's head.

明智之人不会向国王索要任何东西
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

但爱孩子的父亲会
Fathers who love their sons do.

我一定要他的脑袋
I will have his head.

感谢您拼死捍卫我的利益 史塔克夫人
Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.

本来应该是由我保护您的 可惜
I would have come to your defense, but

把他扔回牢里
Take him to the stockades.

用所有你们能找到的链子锁住他！
Bind him with every chain you can find!

您如今倒是真的成为一匹彻头彻尾的母狼了
You've become a real shewolf in your later years.

没剩多少“鱼”的部分了
There's not much fish left in you.

堵上他的嘴！
And gag him!

你从什么时候起开始亲自点灯了？
Since when do you light your own candles?

自从我发觉就连看一会我的贴身侍女
Since I decided that I can't stand to look

都无法忍受时起

你在照搬父亲的话 对吧？
You're quoting father, aren't you?

有何不可？
Why not?

他长于策略 不是么？
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

那是战略 而非策略
We call it tactics, not strategy.

好吧 没错 他的确擅长那些
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

有些人可能会说 他是最擅长的
The best mind, some would say.

这里只有你 我 和乔佛里
It's just you, me, and Joffrey,

七国统治者
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

全境守护者
and protector of the realm.

我相信你最终还是能够切入正题的
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

他必须开始变得像个国王了
He needs to start acting like a king.

这场你们掀起的战争已经打到咱们的门口了
This war you started is coming to our doorstep.

然而如果整座城市都想要乔佛里死
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead

我可没给那孩子妓女让他虐待
I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.

我以为那些姑娘们能帮帮他
I thought the girls might help him.

你真这么想？  我失算了
Did you? I was wrong.

如果我们无法控制他
If we can't control him...

你觉得我从没试过吗？
Do you think I haven't tried?

他根本就不听我的话
He doesn't listen to me.

再想拿链子拴住它就不太容易咯
once you've put a crown on its head.

我一直希望他能变得像詹姆
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

他外表倒是很像…
He looks like him...

在光线合适的时候
in a certain light.

这孩子比起詹姆更像劳勃
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

劳勃是个醉酒的蠢货 但他从不以残忍之行为乐
Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

有些时候我觉得…
Sometimes I wonder...

觉得什么？
What?

这就是对我们的所做所为

罪孽？
Sins?

兄妹通婚了几百年
Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years,

我知道
I know.

每当我和詹姆动摇时 我们就会这样安慰彼此
That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.

奈德・史塔克愚蠢地对我摊牌时 我也是这么说的
It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.

半数的坦格利安都疯了 不是吗？
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

那句话怎么说的来着？
What's the saying?

每当一名坦格利安降生 诸神便抛出一枚硬币
Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.

你战胜了那个谣言
You've beaten the odds.

托曼和弥塞都是像样的好孩子
Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children,

两个都是
both of them.

还等什么？  我们宣誓效忠国王
Why wait? We're sworn to the king.

国王不在  那可是叛国之举
There's not a king. That's treason.

所以就要保护兰尼斯特 是吗？
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

你们统统退后  不 我不会
Back off, you. No, I won't.

您儿子黎明时分归来 夫人？
Your son returns at dawn, My Lady?

他们是这么说的
So they say.

弑君者估计活不过今晚
The Kingslayer won't last the night.

他们喝得越多 怒火就越盛
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

一旦那些卡史塔克们真的拔了剑
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...

谁会乐意为保护兰尼斯特而送命？
who wants to die defending a Lannister?

来
Come.

让我和他独处一会
I need to be alone with him.

夫人 我们的命令是  你们的命令就是我刚刚下达的
My Lady, our ordersyour orders, which I just gave you,

留我和他独处
are to leave me alone with him.

来道别的吗 史塔克夫人？
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

我猜这大概是我在世上的最后一晚了吧
I believe it's my last night in this world.

那家伙是个妞？
Is that a woman?

你听到他们在那边说的话了吗？
Do you hear them out there?

他们想要你的脑袋
They want your head.

呵 老卡史塔克大人看起来不怎么喜欢我
Well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

你用链子把他儿子勒死了
You strangled his son with your chains.

哦 哦
Oh, oh.

就是那个值班的守卫？
Was he the one on guard duty?

他挡了我的道
He was in my way.

所有骑士都会这么做
Any Knight would have done the same.

你才不是骑士
You are no Knight.

你几乎背弃了自己发下的每一条誓言
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

好多好多誓言
So many vows.

他们让你一次又一次地发
They make you swear and swear.

捍卫国王 服从国王
Defend the king, obey the king,

服从你的父亲
obey your father,

守护无辜之人 保护弱者
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

但要是你的父亲轻视国王呢？
But what if your father despises the king?

要是国王滥杀无辜呢？
What if the king massacres the innocent?

太多誓言了
It's too much.

不管你怎么做 迟早不是犯了这条便是叛了那条
No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.

这怪胎你是从哪儿找来的？
Where did you find this beast?

她是个比你优秀百倍的骑士 真正的骑士
She is a truer Knight than you will ever be,

弑君者
Kingslayer.

弑君者
Kingslayer.

他是个什么样的国王啊
What a king he was.

敬坦格利安家族的伊里斯二世
Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name,

七国统治者 全境守护者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm,

敬我刺入他背后的宝剑
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

你真是个毫无荣誉感的人
You are a man without honor.

你知道么
Do you know

除了瑟曦 我没有过别的女人
I've never been with any woman but Cersei?

我有自己的行事之道
So in my own way,

比你那可怜的死了的老奈德更有荣誉感
I have more honor than poor old dead Ned.

他生的杂种叫什么名字？
What was the name of that bastard so in he fathered?

布蕾妮  不 不对
Brienne. No, that wasn't it.

雪诺 北境的私生子
Snow, a bastard from the North.

那么 当 当好人老奈德
Now, whenwhen good old Ned

将某个妓女的孩子带回家时
came home with some whore's baby,

你有没有假装爱过那杂种？
did you pretend to love it?

不 你不太擅长做戏
No. You're not very good at pretending.

你是个诚实的女人
You're an honest woman.

你恨那男孩 对吗？
You hated that boy, didn't you?

你怎么可能不恨他？
How could you not hate him?

他的一举一动 一言一行无时无刻不在提醒你
The walking, talking reminder

那个荣誉至上的艾德・史塔克公爵
that the honorable Lord Eddark Stark

睡了另一个女人
fucked another woman.

拿剑来！
Your sword.

我告诉过你们后果
I told you what would happen.

告诉过你们所有人
All of you

我告诉你们忠诚的侍奉能得到什么…
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally...

以及背叛会换来什么
and what would happen if you did not.

可你们打算怎么做？ 你们又都做了什么？
What are you doing? What have you done?

如果仍旧有人在你们的新领主下令时
If there's any who still question whether your new lord

提出质疑
means what he says...

这就是答案
Here is the answer to your question.

不！
No!
