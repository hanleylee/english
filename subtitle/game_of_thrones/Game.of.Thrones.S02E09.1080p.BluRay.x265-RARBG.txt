根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》改编
原著 乔治・R・R・马丁

第二季第九集  Blackwater
黑水之战

就这样
That's it

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
狭海中的王

戴佛斯・席渥斯
洋葱骑士

马索斯・席渥斯
戴佛斯之子

潮汐对我们不利
The tide's against us

是 但风向对我们有利
Aye, but we have the wind

足以送我们直抵城门
She'll blow us straight to the gate.

你要回家了
You're coming home.

我离开君临这家已有二十年之久
King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.

大半辈子都在跟王家舰队躲迷藏
I spent most of my life dodging the Royal Fleet.

现在却要与他们正面交锋
And now I'm sailing right at them.

我们就是王家舰队
This is the Royal Fleet.

你也不再是走私者了 你是王家舰队总司令
And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.

现在的王家舰队可不止一个
Of course there are several Royal Fleets at the moment.

过了今晚就不是了 当太阳升起之后
Not after tonight. When the sun rises,

史坦尼斯会坐上铁王座
Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne

你会当上首相
and you will be his Hand.

诸神保佑，只有一个神
Gods be good. God.

父亲 一个真神 他看顾着我们
Father, there is only one and he watches over us.

但不看顾他们？ 他看顾着所有人
But not over them? Over all of us.

君临的百姓不会支持伪王
The people of King's Landing did not choose the false King

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
Joffrey Baratheon.

他们很乐意看到他的头被插在枪上
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

不管怎么说 我们得先把他的头砍下来才行
Well, first we have to put it there.

我们的船是他们的十倍
Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one.

我们的人马是他们的五倍
Our army outnumber theirs five to one.

君临城从没被攻破过
Those walls have never been breached.

而守城的那些人
And the men guarding the walls,

可不会把你当解放者
when they see you, they don't see a liberator.

在他们眼中 你是想要烧毁他们城市的陌生人
They see a stranger come to set their city on fire.

我相信光之王
I have faith in the Lord of Light.

相信我们的事业
I have faith in our cause.

相信司令大人你
And I have faith in my captain.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
代理首相 “小恶魔”

雪伊
妓女

害怕吗 我的狮子？
Are you afraid, my lion?

如果君临城破 史坦尼斯会烧死城内每一个兰尼斯特
If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find.

我当然害怕
Of course I'm afraid.

我不会让他们伤害你的
I won't let them hurt you.

我是兰尼斯特家的人
I'm a Lannister.

没法选择自己的命运
I don't have a choice in all this.

但这场战争与你无关
But it's not your war.

现在与我有关了
It is now.

不是万事都能靠你的身子解决的
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

但到目前为止都很顺利
I have so far.

还记得初次见面时 你在帐篷里对我说的话吗？
Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent?

你要我拿出世界末日的劲头
That I should make love to you like it was your

跟你做爱
last day on this earth.

如你所知 陛下
As you know, Your Grace,

学士对他所效力的家族的责任
it is not only the sworn duty of a Maester

派席尔
大学士

不止是执行主人的命令
to carry out the wishes of the house he serves,

更要在战争时期
but also to offer guidance

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

为主人提供必要的指导和建议
and counsel in times of war.

你的谏言一直都明智而慎重
Your words are always wise and measured.

如果你可以… 如果有什么不同的话
If you could... If anything,

那就是学士的责任
a Maester's duties become more urgent

在战争和骚乱中变得更加重要
in times of war and turmoil.

我记得在先王…
I remember back in the days of king...

你给我带了东西来？
You brought me something?

是的
Yes.

夜影之水
Essence of Nightshade

极其有效也非常危险
is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

在红酒中加入一滴
A single drop in a cup of wine

就能缓和紧绷的神经
suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

三滴会带来
Three drops will bring on a deep

无梦的深眠
and dreamless sleep.

十滴的话…
ten drops, however...

我知道十滴的后果
I know what 10 drops will bring.

陛下 可否容我冒昧地问… 不可
Your Grace, if I may ask... You may not.

你一定有很多事要忙
You must have a lot of work to do.

众多勇士很快就会需要你的谏言了
I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.

是的 围城往往…
Yes. A siege is very...

注意楼梯台阶 大学士 对你来说太多了
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.

陛下
Your Grace.

?  噢 他这样说  ?
and so he spoke

?  卡斯特梅的爵爷他这样说  ?
that Lord of Castamere

?  然而今天 每逢雨季  ?
but now the rains

?  雨水在大厅哭泣  ?
weep o'er his halls

波隆
都城守备队队长

?  内里却无人影  ?
with no one there to hear

?  然而今天 每逢雨季  ?
yes, now the rains

?  雨水在大厅哭泣  ?
weep o'er his halls

?  内里却无魂灵  ?
and not a soul to hear.

敬大伙！ 兰尼斯特万岁！
To the boys! Lannisters!

你从哪学到这首兰尼斯特的歌？
Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

喝醉的兰尼斯特呗
Drunk Lannisters.

你的嗓子真不赖
You've got a pretty voice.

承蒙夸奖
Thank you very much.

我也喜欢你的鼻子
And I like your nose.

你的鼻子被打破过多少次？
How many times you break it?

哦 让我想想
Well, now let's see.

第一次我才五岁
First time I was five.

我老妈用拨火棍给了我一下子
Me mom smacked me with an iron poker.

哦
Ooh.

哦 她其实不是想打我
Oh, it wasn't me she was aiming at.

是想打我弟弟
She was trying for me little brother.

他可是个真正的讨厌鬼
Now he was a real pest.

第二次我九岁
Second time I was nine.

跟几个大孩子打了起来
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

他们赢了
They won.

第三次嘛…
Third time...

嘿 你不会想知道第三次发生了什么的
Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.

可怜的鼻子
Poor nose.

不用可怜它
Don't feel sorry for him.

不等今晚过完它就会爬上你的屁股
He'll be halfway up your ass before the night's through.

欢迎之至 朋友们
Welcome, friends.

这轮算我的
This round's on me.

我想他大概不喜欢我
I don't think he likes me.

桑铎・克里冈
御林铁卫 “猎狗”

你觉得自己是条硬汉？
You think you're a hard man?

我确实是
I know it.

这里又暖和
It's warm in here.

又有漂亮女人
We've got beautiful women

还有不错的麦芽酒
and good brown ale.

足够每个人喝的
Plenty for everyone.

你却只想着
And all you want

把我们中的某个人送往冰冷地底下
is to put one of us in the cold ground

那边甚至没有女人陪伴
with no women to keep us company.

哦 那边有女人
Oh, there's women in the ground.

我亲手便送过去不少
I put some there myself.

你也送过
So have you.

你喜欢干女人
You like fucking

喝酒 唱歌
and drinking and singing.

但是杀人
But killing

杀人才是你的最爱
killing's the thing you love.

你就跟我一样
You're just like me.

只不过小了一号
Only smaller.

但快得多
And quicker.

嘿？
Eh?

你的主子小恶魔会想念你的
Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you.

是啊
Aye.

我想他有一天会的
I expect he will someday.

是集合钟
Here we are.

开战之前再来一杯？
One more drink before the war?

怎样？
Shall we?

瓦里斯
情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

我一直很讨厌钟声
I've always hated the bells.

响起来就没好事
They ring for horror

国王逝世 城市被围困
a dead king, a city under siege.

还有婚礼，是的
A wedding. Exactly.

他叫波德瑞克 对吗？
Podrick, is that it?

“是吗？” 装得真像
"Is that it?" Nice touch.

好像你不知道城里每个男孩的名字似的
As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.

我不明白您在暗示什么
I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

我很肯定你明白我在暗示什么
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.

您信任他吗？
Do you trust him?

波德瑞克・派恩
提利昂的侍从

说来也怪 我很信任他
Oddly enough, I do.

很好
Good.

您要的地图
The map you asked for.

城市地下看来有二十里长的隧道
There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.

将近五十里
Closer to 50.

坦格利安家建城时不仅考虑了城防工事
The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege

还预留了必要的逃跑路线
and to provide escape if necessary.

我不会逃跑
I'm not escaping.

听起来有点奇怪 但我是这艘船的船长
Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship.

船在人在 船亡人亡
And if the ship goes down, I go with her.

的确是豪言壮语
That is good to hear.

不过当船尚未沉没时
Though I'm sure many captains say the same

很多船长都夸下过这样的海口
while their ship is afloat.

您看上去作好了打架的准备 大人
You look well suited for battle, My Lord.

不 我才没有
Well, I'm not.

为了我们彼此 我希望您是错的
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

小小鸟告诉我 史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon

和一位亚夏红袍女祭司鬼混在一起
has taken up with a Red Priestess from Asshai.

那又如何？
What of it?

您不相信古老的力量 大人？
You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord?

血魔法 诅咒 易形者 你相信否？
Blood spells, curses, shapeshiftingwhat do you think?

我猜您笃信眼见为实
I think you believe in what you see

也相信您信任的人看见的事
and in what those you trust have seen.

您大概不会完全信任我
You probably don't entirely trust me.

嗯 别把它当成私人恩怨
Mm, don't take it personally.

其实我连我自己都不敢完全相信
I don't entirely trust myself.

但我确实看过一些事情
And yet I have seen things

听过一些事情
and heard things

那些您不曾见闻 我也宁愿自己未曾见闻的事情
things you have not, things I wish I had not.

我好像没告诉过您我是怎么被阉割的
I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.

是的 你应该没说过
No, I don't believe you have.

某天我会告诉您的
One day I will.

黑暗的魔法为史坦尼斯大人带来了军队
The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies

为他铺好抵达君临城门的道路
and paved his path to our door.

侍奉此等力量的人倘若坐上铁王座
For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne,

没有比这更可怕的事了
I can think of nothing worse.

今夜
And tonight,

我相信您是唯一能阻止他的人
I believe you are the only man who can stop him.

他们在欢迎新王
They're welcoming the new king.

我从未听说鸣钟意味投降
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

他们想奏音乐？那就合奏个痛快
They want to play music with us? Let's play.

击鼓，击鼓！
Drums. Drums!

记住 等船
Remember, wait till the shit

史坦尼斯的船已经进了海湾
The ships are in the bay.

放他们深入 别让他们
They must be far enough in so they won't be

我懂什么是“深入”
I know what "in" means.

知道怎么使这家伙吗？ 我砍过树
Do you know how to use that? I chopped wood once.

不 我是见过我老哥砍树
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

我见过你用盾牌杀人
I saw you kill a man with a shield.

拿斧子的你勇不可挡
You'll be unstoppable with an axe.

别被杀了，你也一样 朋友
Don't get killed. Nor you, my friend.

噢 我们现在是朋友了？ 当然是
Oh, are we friends now? Of course we are.

我付钱你效劳
Just because I pay you for your services doesn't

并不会消减我们的友谊
diminish our friendship.

反而因此升华 可不是
Enhances it, really.

噢 佣兵嘴里居然吐出“升华”这种高雅词
Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword.

和高雅的爷们儿混久了呗
Been spending time with fancy folks.

珊莎・史塔克
乔佛里的未婚妻

珊莎小姐 和 嗯 雪拉
Lady Sansa and, uh, Sheila.

雪伊
Shae.

雪伊 对
Shae, yes.

想必我姐姐邀请你跟其他贵妇人
Surely my sister has asked you to join

一起去梅葛楼了吧？
the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

是的 大人
She has, My Lord,

但乔佛里国王召我来为他送行
but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

珊莎
Sansa.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

我外甥还真浪漫啊
He's been a great romantic, my nephew.

珊莎 过来
Sansa, come here.

我会祈祷您平安归来的 大人
I will pray for your safe return, My Lord.

真的
Will you?

就像我为国王祈祷的一样
Just as I pray for the King's.

保护好自己 我的女士
Stay safe, My Lady.

你也是 我的狮子
And you, my lion.

你的国王即将出征
Your king rides forth to battle.

你要吻别他
You should see him off with a kiss.

这是我的新剑
My new blade.

我命名它为“噬心”
Hearteater I've named it.

吻它
Kiss it.

等我回来 你要再吻它
You'll kiss it again when I return

到时你会尝到我叔叔的鲜血
and taste my Uncle's blood.

您会亲自杀掉他么
Will you slay him yourself?

只要史坦尼斯蠢到向我挑战
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

那您会率领前锋 冲出城门喽？
So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the Vanguard?

国王可不会跟愚蠢的姑娘家
A king doesn't discuss

讨论战术
battle plans with stupid girls.

抱歉 陛下 您说得对 我很愚蠢
I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.

您当然会率领前锋
Of course you'll be in the Vanguard.

听说我哥哥罗柏
They say my brother Robb always goes

总往战况最激烈的地方去
where the fighting is thickest.

而他还不是真正的国王呢
And he is only a pretender.

有一天会轮到你哥哥的
Your brother's turn will come.

等着在“噬心”上尝到他的鲜血吧
Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.

这些男孩好多都会一去不返
Some of those boys will never come back.

乔佛里会
Joffrey will.

恶人总是能活下来
The worst ones always live.

嘘 跟我来 小姐
Shh. Come, My Lady.

蓝赛尔・兰尼斯特
凯冯之子 瑟曦和詹姆的堂弟

我们的舰队哪去了？ 待会就到
Where's our fleet? On the way.

为何眼下不在？ 敌人已经来了
Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

猎狗 告诉首相 国王问他问题呢
Hound, tell the Hand that his King has asked him a question.

国王刚刚问你问题呢
The King has asked you a question.

蓝赛尔爵士 让猎狗告诉国王
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king

首相忙不过来
that the Hand is extremely busy.

国王之手让我告诉你
The Hand of the King would like me to tell

再让你转告国王
you to tell the King

要是我让猎狗把你砍成两半
If I tell the Hound to cut you in half,

他想都不用想 直接就会动手
he'll do it without a second thought.

那我就成了“半半人”
That would make me the Quarterman.

听起来可不怎么动听
It just doesn't have the same ring to it.

把我剁了 我就没法放出信号
Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal.

没有信号 计划就得泡汤
No signal, no plan.

计划泡汤 史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩就会轻易拿下都城
No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city,

夺走铁王座 再把你的小脑袋
takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched

找扇城门插上去
little head atop a gate somewhere.

说不定挺喜感的
It might be quite amusing,

只不过我的脑袋也得插在那
except that my head would be up there, too.

虽说我的脑袋不怎么可爱
I've never much liked my head,

但我还不想把它丢掉
but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

怎不见敌船
Where are their ships?

看样子我们夜袭是对的 让他们措手不及了
It is wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.

瓦里斯大人知道你三天前的早餐吃了啥
Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago.

他们对一切都了如指掌
There are no surprises here.

听说敌营中意见不合
If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,

说不定他们的水手兵变了
maybe their sailors have mutinied.

但愿吧
Maybe.

托曼・拜拉席恩
乔佛里之弟

不知道她为什么让我到这来
I don't know why she wants me here.

她总说我多么的笨 她讨厌我
She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.

也许她更讨厌其他人呢
Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.

我不信
I doubt it.

或者她嫉妒你呢
Maybe she's jealous of you.

我有什么好嫉妒的？
Why would she be jealous?

珊莎
Sansa.

我刚还在想 小白鸽飞到哪去了
I was wondering where our little dove had flown.

你脸色不太好 孩子
You look pale, child.

初潮还在继续？
Is your red flower still blooming?

是的
Yes.

真巧 不是么？
Fitting, isn't it?

男人在外面流血 你却在里面流
The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here.

给珊莎小姐倒酒
Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

我不渴 陛下
I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

那又怎样？ 又不是让你喝水
So? I didn't offer you water.

伊林・派恩
御前执法官

他在这做什么？
What's he doing here?

伊林爵士？
Ser Ilyn?

他在这保护我们
He's here to defend us.

当利斧劈开这扇门时
When the axes smash down those doors,

你就会庆幸他在这儿了
you may be glad to have him.

但我们有卫兵啊
But we have guards to defend us.

雇来的佣兵而已
Guards we have paid.

如果城池陷落 他们会争先恐后地
Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones

逃之夭夭
out of the doors.

小伙子们逮到一个马夫和两个女仆 他们偷了匹马
The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away

和几个黄金杯子 想溜出城门
with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

战斗中的第一批叛徒
The battle's first traitors.

交给伊林爵士处置
Have Ser Ilyn see to them.

把头插在枪上 挂在马厩外以儆效尤
Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.

让臣民保持忠诚的唯一办法
The only way to keep the small folk loyal

就是确保他们惧怕你胜过惧怕你的敌人
is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.

如果你想成为王后的话 记住这一点
Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.

您说他在这里是要保护我们
You said he was here to protect us.

没错
He is.

叛徒对我们所有人都是威胁
Traitors are a danger to us all.

再来一杯
More wine.

他们来了
There they are.

弓箭手就位，弓箭手 就位！
Archers to their marks. Archers, to your marks!

弓箭手！
Archers!

拉箭上弦！
Nock your arrows!

拉箭上弦！
Nock arrows!

稳住，稳住！
Hold fast. Hold fast!

你在想什么？ 我们得攻击才行
What are you doing? We need to attack them.

稳住，石头准备好！
Hold fast. Boulders ready!

稳住！
Hold fast!

怎么只有一条船 其他的船在哪？
There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them?

其他的船在哪？
Where are the rest of them?!

他们只有一条船
There's only one ship.

弓箭手 准备！
Archers, stand to!

舱下预备
Man the below!

上弦！ 上弦装膛
Nock! Nock and set!

拉弓！
Draw!

稳住
Hold.

稳住！
Hold!

船上没人
There's no one on board.

哈林
火术士

更多石头运来了！
More rocks coming up!

稳住
Hold.

野火
Wildfire.

绕开！绕开！
Steer clear! Steer clear!

马索斯！ 趴下！
Matthos! Get down!

准备登陆，陛下
Prepare to land. Your Grace

侏儒的小把戏玩得不错
The dwarf has played his little trick.

那可是野火，这种把戏他只能玩一次
The wildfireHe can only play it once.

我们离城门太远
We're too far from the gates.

野火 弓箭手
The fire, their archers

过河会死几百人
hundreds will die.

几千人
Thousands.

跟我上 拿下都城！
Come with me and take this city!

唐托斯・霍拉德
弄臣

珊莎 过来吧 小白鸽
Sansa, come here, little dove.

太后陛下
My queen.

你在做什么
What are you doing?

祈祷
Praying.

你是个完美的女孩 对么？
You're perfect, aren't you?

祈祷
Praying.

你在祈祷什么？
What are you praying for?

祈祷诸神赐予大家慈悲
For the Gods to have mercy on us all.

噢 大家？
Oh. On all of us?

是的 陛下，连我在内？
Yes, Your Grace. Even me?

当然 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

乔佛里也在内？
Even Joffrey?

乔佛里是我的，噢 闭嘴吧 你这个小傻瓜
Joffrey is myOh, shut up, you little fool.

祈祷诸神赐予大家慈悲
Praying to the Gods to have mercy on us all.

诸神没有慈悲 所以他们才是神
The Gods have no mercy. That's why they're Gods.

我父亲在我祈祷的时候曾这么教诲我
My father told me that when he caught me praying.

你瞧 那时我母亲刚去世
My mother just died, you see.

我还不懂得什么是死亡
I didn't really understand the concept of death,

什么是终结
the finality of it.

我以为只要非常非常虔诚地祈祷
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,

诸神就会把母亲还给我 毕竟我才四岁

若我那可恶的弟弟侥幸成功
If my wretched brother should somehow prevail,

这些母鸡就会回到她们的公鸡身边
these hens will return to their cocks

宣传我是如何勇敢地激励她们

振作她们的精神
lifted their spirits.

要是城堡陷落呢？
And if the city should fall?

你就希望那样 对不对？
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

when a city is sacked?

不 你不知道 对吧？

如果都城沦陷 这些贵妇人们
If the city falls, these fine women

恐怕都得忍受一点强暴
should be in for a bit of a rape.

到第二天早上 她们中的一半人

我就操烂谁的尸体

小时候
When we were young, Jaime and I,

詹姆和我长得太像
we looked so much alike.

甚至连我们的父亲也常分不清
Even our father couldn't tell us apart.

我永远无法理解为何彼此会受到迥异的对待
I could never understand why they treated us differently.

詹姆练习长剑 枪矛和钉头锤
Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace,

我却练习微笑
and I was taught to smile

唱歌和讨人欢喜
and sing and please.

我则像马一样被卖给陌生人
and I was sold to some stranger like a horse

新主人想骑就骑
to be ridden whenever he desired.

You were Robert's queen.

Do you want to hear the truth?

想不想知道我叫他来的真正原因？
You want to know why he's really here?

他为我们而来
He's here for us.

史坦尼斯也许能攻进都城 夺取王位
Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne,

但他绝不可能生擒我们
but he will not take us alive.
