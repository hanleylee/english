家

三眼乌鸦
最后的绿先知

布兰登・史塔克
艾德和凯特琳的次子

再跟他打一轮 奈德
Give him another go, Ned.

那是我父亲
That's my father.

还有我叔叔班扬
And my Uncle Benjen.

抬高盾牌 不然我会把你的脑袋敲得嗡嗡响
Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell.

他们好开心
They were all so happy.

你曾经也是
So were you once.

别显摆了
Stop showing off.

莱安娜！
Benjen: Lyanna!

我姑姑莱安娜
My Aunt Lyanna.

我在墓窖中见过她的雕像
 I've seen her statue in the crypt.

父亲从不谈论她
My father never talked about her.

你别在这儿碍事行吗？我们正练武呢
Benjen:  Would you get out of here? We're sparring.

等奈德去了鹰巢城 看你和谁练武
Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

不知道
Benjen:  I don't know.

他怎么样？
What about him?

威利斯 过来
Wylis, come here.

阿多？
Hodor?

可他有巨人的血统
Benjen:  But he's got giant's blood.

而你训练有素 依我看是场公平对决
And you've got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.

班杨冲锋前总会扬起下巴
Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.

他躲避时则会收回下巴 小姐
And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.

阿多会说话？
Hodor talks?

让少爷们去练武 威利斯
You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis.

赶紧过来 那不是你该待的地方
Come along, now. It's no place for you.

噢 奶妈 看看他的体格
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

他要是好好练武 一定所向披靡
If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable.

哎，他不会练的，他只是个马僮罢了
Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy.

放过他吧
So leave him be.

该走了
It is time to go.

拜托 再等一会儿
Please, a little longer.

你终于向我展示了我真正在乎的东西
You finally show me something I care about

却又将我带走
and then you drag me away.

海底的风景纵然美丽
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

但若待得太久 你会被淹死
but if you stay too long, you'll drown.

我没被淹死 我回家了
I wasn't drowning. I was home.

威利斯
Wylis.

阿多
Hodor.

我见到了小时候的你
I saw you as a boy.

你能说话
You could talk.

后来发生了什么？
What happened?

阿多
Hodor.

梅拉在哪儿？
Where's Meera?

阿多
Hodor.

你不该待在这儿
You shouldn't be here.

洞外不安全
It's not safe outside the cave.

没有哪里是安全的
It's not safe anywhere.

我看到阿多以前不是这样的
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

阿多 他的真名叫威利斯
Hodor.  His real name is Wylis.

他会说话、能打架……还有……
And he could talk and fight andand then

怎么了？
What's wrong?

梅拉・黎德
霍兰・黎德的女儿

三眼乌鸦说大战将至
The ThreeEyed Raven says there's a war coming.

而我们就在那里面打仗？
And we're going to fight it in there?

布兰登・史塔克需要你
Brandon Stark needs you.

叶子
森林之子

要我干什么？我坐在那里
For what? I sit in there

看他坠入幻梦 然后什么都没有发生
and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.

他不会永远留在这里
He isn't going to stay here forever.

等到出去的那一天 他会需要你
And out there he needs you.

时间到了 戴佛斯爵士

艾迪森・托勒特
守夜人  “忧郁的艾迪”

是那些将匕首捅进总司令心脏的人

嘘 嘿
 ( people laughing )  Man:  Shh, hey.

然后她来了 趾高气扬的瑟曦太后
Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei,

奶子和丰臀在微风中摇摆
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

她突然看向我
All of a sudden she looks my way.

微笑着对我说：“怎么样？”
Gives me a little smile like, "Well?"

接下来 你们知道的 我从不害羞
So, all right, you know, I've never been shy

我那话儿大得很，我把它掏了出来
and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out.

她从没见过这么好的家伙
( laughing ) She's never seen anything like it.

我是说 她习惯了她弟弟的 可我听说
I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear,

詹姆・兰尼斯特那话儿还不如这根指头
Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.

喔！
Ooh!

她看到我的 我对天发誓她舔了舔嘴唇
She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.

( laughing )

那个 你们都了解我

You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?

请原谅我 陛下 但国王命令我不得让您通过

我要跟我儿子谈一谈
I would like to speak to my son.

他已经离开红堡了 陛下

她长大了

快长大了
Jaime:  Almost.

杀害崔斯丹王子的凶手找到了吗？
Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?

我觉得可能是母亲干的

你母亲不会那样做的
Your mother wouldn't do that.

不 她会的

“弑君者”

你在生她的气吗？
Are you angry with her?

当然没有  那你为什么不让她来？
Of course not. Then why didn't you let her come?

她完全有权来这儿
She has every right to be here.

我听说她不能出现在圣堂
They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.

如果她试图――
If she had tried

不会再有人把你母亲关起来了
They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.

只要我在就不会
Not while I'm here.

你为什么没去看过她？
Why haven't you gone to see her?

她所承受的一切都是为了你

为什么？

When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery,

我做了什么？
what did I do?

他们让她像妓女一样游街
When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,

我又做了什么？
what did I do?

我们都有无能为力的时候
We all fail sometimes.

国王本该是全境守护者
The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.

可如果连自己的妻子和母亲都守护不了
If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother,

那我算什么？
what good am I?

你真是胆大包天
You're a bold man.

恰恰相反

我诚惶诚恐
I fear a great deal.

天父 圣母
The Father, the Mother,

战士
the Warrior.

你知道我们为什么要用这些石头？
Do you know why we use these stones?

为的是提醒自己不要害怕死亡
To remind us not to fear death.

我们在现世闭上眼睛 在来世会重新睁开
We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.

你一定非常渴望来世

说实话 我害怕来世
In truth, I fear that, too.

你囚禁并侮辱了我的姐姐

你的姐姐寻求诸神的宽恕
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

大麻雀
总主教

以赎清罪过
and atoned for her sin.

那我的罪过呢？
What about my sins?

我违背神圣的誓言 背后捅刀 杀死了我的国王
I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back.

我杀了我的堂弟
I killed my own cousin.

诸神判定我弟弟有罪
When the gods judged my brother guilty,

我却帮他逃脱了制裁
I helped him escape their justice.

我要怎么赎罪
What atonement do I deserve?

你要血染圣堂？
You would spill blood in this holy place?

噢，诸神才不会在意
Oh, the gods won't mind.

他们制造的鲜血比我们凡人多得多
They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.

那就动手吧
Go on, then.

我罪有应得 我们都一样
I deserve it. We all do.

我们都是软弱、虚妄的生灵
We are weak, vain creatures.

只因圣母慈悲才得以存活
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

想救你 恐怕他们还得靠近些
They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.

不需要
I don't.

你想杀我 他们阻止不了
They'd never reach me before you struck.

我在众寡更悬殊的情形下战斗过
I've fought against worse odds.

的确 我们中的很多人会送命
No doubt many of us would fall.

但我们算得了什么，嗯？
But who are we, hmm?

我们无名无姓 居无定所
We have no names, no family.

我们每个人都很弱小
Every one of us is poor and powerless.

但合在一起
And yet together,

足以推翻强权
we can overthrow an empire.

母亲
Tommen:  Mother.

她的下葬礼服是红色还是金色？
Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?

金色
Gold.

很好 她喜欢这个颜色
Good. It was always her color.

很抱歉把你关在这里
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

我不该这样，但我……
 I shouldn't have, but I was

我理解
I understand.

见到你很高兴
I'm glad to see you.

我知道……我应该早点来
I know I should have come sooner.

我想来的 我错了
I wanted to. I was wrong.

没关系
It's all right.

不，有关系
No, it isn't.

我早该把他们全部处死
I should have executed all of them.

在大麻雀他们侮辱你之前
I should have pulled down the sept

我就该把教会掀个底朝天
onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you,

为了我 你就会这么做
as you would have for me.

您教我变得坚强…
You raised me to be strong...

我没能做到
and I wasn't.

但我想坚强起来
But I want to be.

帮帮我吧
Help me.

随时随地
Always.

我没笑话侏儒
I do not make dwarf jokes.

你在脑子里笑话了
You think them. ( sighs )

行了 说说被烧掉的船
So, the fleet. It's been burned.

我们一直在清查下手的人，迄今为止毫无线索
We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.

但我相信 继续下去一定会有所收获
Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.

阿斯塔波和渊凯已不再向我们求助
Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.

也许是他们的小阴谋
Perhaps they can tell us their secret.

奴隶主夺回了那两座城市

What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.

弥桑黛
侍女

它们不肯进食
They are not eating.

丹妮莉丝女王离开后 它们没碰过任何食物
They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.

丹妮莉丝是龙女王
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

显然 让龙饿着是不好的
Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious.

如果龙不想吃 你如何强迫它吃？
If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?

龙不适合关起来
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

你怎么知道？ 我就是知道
How do you know this? That's what I do.

我不仅好酒，知道的事也不少
I drink and I know things.

伊耿用来征服维斯特洛的巨龙
The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros

它们一飞冲天 扶摇万里
ranged over hundreds of miles.

可到了后来 丹妮莉丝的先辈们
Then Daenerys's ancestors

把它们用铁链锁在坑里
started chaining them up in pens.

短短几代之后
A few generations later,

最后几条龙还没猫大
the last dragons were no larger than cats.

必须卸掉锁链 否则它们就废了
They must be unchained or they'll waste away.

弥桑黛
Missandei,

你接近那些龙多少次了？
how many times were you in the company of these dragons?

很多次  它们可曾伤害你？
Many times. And did they ever harm you?

从未有过
Never.

龙是智慧生物
Dragons are intelligent.

某些学士声称它们比人还聪明
More intelligent than men according to some maesters.

它们对朋友友好
They have affection for their friends

对敌人则是满腔怒火
and fury for their enemies.

我可是他们的朋友  它们会明白这个？
I am their friend. Do they know that?

当然 它们该吃晚饭了
They will. It's time they had their supper.

我是你们妈妈的朋友
I'm friends with your mother.

我是来帮忙的
I'm here to help.

不能把帮忙的人吃掉哟
Don't eat the help. ( chuckles nervously )

我小时候
When I was a child,

叔叔问我命名日想要什么礼物
an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.

我求叔叔说想要一条龙
I begged him for one of you.

我甚至告诉他：“不用太大只的也行。”
"It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon," I told him.

“像我这么小的就好。”
"It could be little like me."

所有人都乐坏了 好像这是他们听过的最滑稽的事
Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.

然后我父亲告诉我
Then my father told me

最后的巨龙死在一个世纪之前
the last dragon had died a century ago.

那晚 我哭着入睡
I cried myself to sleep that night.

可是……你看看现在
But here you are.

下回我再冒出这种念头
Next time I have an idea like that,

务必照我脸上来一拳
punch me in the face.

只要有一个史塔克尚在人间

您在北境的统治就永无宁日
as long as a Stark can walk through that door.

黑城堡的南面是不设防的
Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.

而且那里没剩下几个人，都是些农夫和窃贼而已

With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow

我们用不着所有的家族

安柏家 曼德勒家 卡史塔克家

他们麾下的军队比北境其他家族加起来还多
command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.

有他们的支持就没人能挑战我们

临冬城里发生了什么？
What happened at Winterfell?

我早就该跟你走
I should have gone with you while I had the chance.

珊莎小姐 那是个艰难的选择
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

但我们不能回避
We've all had to make difficult choices.

波德瑞克・派恩
侍从

我们不该生火的
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

这不安全
It's not safe.

他会继续追杀我们
He won't stop hunting us.

席恩・葛雷乔伊
“臭佬”

我们只需赶到黑城堡
We just have to make it to Castle Black.

只要找到琼恩 拉姆斯就抓不到我们了
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us.

我只要踏进黑城堡 琼恩就会杀了我
Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.

我不会让他那么做
I won't let him.

我会告诉他布兰和瑞肯的真相
I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.

还有我杀掉磨坊男孩来代替他们的真相
And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.

还有我把罗德利克爵士砍头的真相
And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

还有我背叛罗柏的真相
And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed.

当你披上黑衣，一切罪行都会被宽恕
When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.

我不愿被宽恕
I don't want to be forgiven.

我对您的家族所做的一切
I can never make amends to your family

永远无法弥补
for the things I've done.

他们本来可以保护你安全无恙
They'll keep you safer than I ever could.

你不和我们一起走？
You're not coming with us?

我真想把你一路带到长城
I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.

为此我宁愿献出生命
I would have died to get you there.

我可以带走一匹马吗？
May I take one of the horses?

你要去哪里？
Where will you go?

回家
Home.

葛洛佛家族夺回了深林堡
Yara:  The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.

那些守卫它的铁种呢？
And the ironborn who held it?

巴隆・葛雷乔伊
铁群岛之王

他们战至最后一人
They died fighting to a man.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

但他们死了
But they did

亚拉・葛雷乔伊
海怪之女

入侵行动失败了
and our invasion died with them.

深林堡是我们在大陆的最后一个据点
Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.

我们会攻取更多
Then we will take more.

为什么？为了更多的松果和岩石？
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

因为这是我的命令
Because I order it.

我们在海上不可战胜
We can defeat anyone at sea,

但我们守不住城堡和土地
but we'll never hold lands and castles

打不过大陆上的军队
against mainland armies.

如果我的船长们违抗命令 擅离职守
Not if our captains defy my orders,

把部下消耗在愚蠢的任务中 我们当然会输
abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.

我不会为试图营救席恩而道歉
I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.

那么他在哪里?
Then where is he?

你的王国又在哪里？
Where is your kingdom?

我们能拿下那些城堡 是因为北方佬去了南方打仗
We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war.

现在仗打完了
That war is over.

上一次我们做得过火的时候
The last time we provoked them too far,

我在那窗前眼睁睁看着他们突破了我们的城墙
I watched from that window as they breached our walls

摧毁了我们的塔楼
 and knocked down our towers.

那天我失去了两个哥哥
 I lost two brothers that day.

我失去了三个儿子
And I lost three sons.

他们说，这是五王之战
The War of the Five Kings, they call it.

好吧，其他四个都死了
Well, the other four are dead.

等你统治铁群岛时 想怎么和平都随你
When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want.

但现在，闭上嘴，服从我
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

不然我找个听话的来当继承人
or I will make another heir who will.

让开
Let me pass.

蠢货 给你的国王让路
You fool, move aside for your king.

我一直都是这样做的 不是吗 哥哥？
Haven't I always, brother?

我以为你早在异乡的海底烂成了骨头
I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.

逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

我走以后，习俗变了？
Has the custom changed since I've been gone?

你不应该重复这句话吗？
Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

你不用我掺和也能嘲弄我们的神
You can mock our god without my help.

我没有嘲弄淹神
I don't mock the Drowned God.

我就是淹神
I am the Drowned God.

从旧镇到魁尔斯
From Oldtown to Qarth,

无论是谁，看见我的船帆就会祈祷
when men see my sails, they pray.

你老了 哥哥
( chuckles ) You're old, brother.

你的时代过去了
 You've had your time.

是时候退位让贤了
Now let another rule.

我听说你在玉海的风暴里
I heard you lost your mind

丧失了理智
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

他们把你绑在桅杆上以防你跳海
They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.

没错
They did.

风暴过去后 你割了他们的舌头
And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.

我需要安静
I needed silence.

什么样的铁种
What kind of an ironborn

会在风暴中失去理智？
loses his senses during a storm?

我就是风暴 哥哥
I am the storm, brother.

世上唯一的风暴
The first storm and the last.

而你挡我的路了
And you're in my way.

主 请将您的仆人巴隆收归波涛之下
Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves.

以他的血肉喂养您王国的子民
Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.

将他的骨骸归于深邃的大海
Pull his bones down to your depths

与他的祖先和孩子一同长眠
to rest beside his ancestors and his children.

逝者不死
All: What is dead may never die.

我会找出凶手
I'm going to find out who did this.

我会把他们活着拿去喂鲨鱼
I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.

我以海盐王座发誓
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

你不能以海盐王座发誓
The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,

除非选王会选择了你
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

我父亲想要我来统治
My father would have wanted me to rule.

你父亲无权这样做 律法讲得清清楚楚
Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.

也许你会胜出
Perhaps you'll win.

也许你会成为史上首位统治铁民的女人
Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.

也许不会
And perhaps not.

进来
Come in.

抱歉 夫人 我不是有意打扰
I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.

你没有打扰我
You interrupt nothing.

我想您知道我为何而来
I assume you know why I'm here.

你告诉我我才能知道
I will after you tell me.

是关于总司令
It's about the Lord Commander.

前总司令
The former Lord Commander.

必须是这样吗？
Does he have to be?

梅丽珊卓 
红袍祭司

你想要什么？
What are you asking?

您是否知道有什么魔法……
Do you know of any magic...

能帮到他？
that could help him?

带他回来？
Bring him back?

如果你想帮助他 就让他安息吧
If you want to help him, leave him be.

我说的事，能做到吗?
Can it be done?

的确存在这样的能力
There are some with this power.

怎么做？ 我不知道
 How?  I don't know.

您见过吗？
Have you seen it done?

我见过一个死而复生的人
I met a man who came back from the dead,

但施法的祭司……
but the priest who did it

这种事本不该进行
it shouldn't have been possible.

但它确实可行 现在也应该可以
But it was. It could be now.

我不行
Not for me.

您不行？
Not for you?

我见过您喝下致命的毒药
I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.

我见过您生下影子的恶魔
I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.

我曾笃信的一切
Everything I believed,

我曾在圣火中目睹的伟大胜利
the great victory I saw in the flames,

全是谎言
all of it was a lie.

你一直都是对的
You were right all along.

光之王从未给予我启示
The Lord never spoke to me.

那就让他见鬼去
Fuck him, then.

让他们都见鬼去
Fuck all of them.

很显然我不是个虔诚的人
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

七神 淹神 树神 对我来说都是一样的
Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.

我不是在向光之王求助
I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.

我是在向那个曾向我展现奇迹的女人求助
I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.

我从未有过这种天赋
I never had this gift.

您试过吗？
Have you ever tried?

求你了
( sighs ) Please.
