马林·特兰
御林铁卫

珊莎·史塔克
乔佛里的未婚妻

这话我已经说过了
I already saidit was well struck.

是的 陛下
Yes, Your Grace.

接下来是谁？ 罗索·布伦

效劳于贝里席大人麾下的自由骑手

霍拉德家族的红骑士唐托斯爵士
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

霍拉德家族的红骑士唐托斯爵士！
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

我来了
Here I am.

我来了

抱歉 陛下
Sorry, Your Grace.

我深表歉意
My deepest apologies.

你喝醉了？ 不是
Are you drunk? No.

呃 没有 没有醉 陛下
Uh, no.No, Your Grace.

唐托斯·霍拉德
骑士

我只喝了两杯，两杯？
I had two cups of wine. Two cups?

还不算多嘛
That's not much at all.

那就请再喝一杯吧
Please,have another cup.

说真的么 陛下？
Are you sure, Your Grace?

没错 来庆祝一下我的命名日
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

整两杯 想喝多少喝多少
Have two.Have as much as you like.

我非常荣幸 陛下
I would be honored,Your Grace.

马林爵士 帮唐托斯爵士备酒以庆祝我的命名日
Ser Meryn, help Ser Don to scelebrate my name day.

让他喝个痛快
See that he drinks his fill.

您不可以这样
You can't.

你刚才说什么？
What did you say?

你说我不可以？
Did you say I can't?

我只是觉得若您在命名日杀人
I only meant it would be bad luck

恐怕会招来厄运 陛下
to kill a man on your name day.

这是什么乡下人的迷信…
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

这姑娘说得有理
The girl is right.

俗话说 命名日上播种子
What a man sows on his name day

一整年内结果子
he reaps all year.

桑铎·克里冈
御林铁卫 “猎狗”

把他带下去吧
Take him away.

我明天再杀他 这蠢才
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

没错 他是个蠢材
He is.

而您真是英明睿智 一眼就看出来了
A foolyou're so clever to see it.

此等蠢才天生是弄臣的料 而非骑士
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

他不配死得干净利落
He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

唐托斯爵士 你听见小姐说话了吗？
Did you hear My Lady,Ser Dontos?

从今天起 你就是我的新弄臣
From this day,you'll be my new fool.

感谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

还有您 小姐 谢谢您
And you, My Lady,thank you.

亲爱的外甥
 Beloved nephew.

波隆
佣兵

提利昂·兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

我还在战场上四处找你嘞
We looked for you on the battlefield.

还真难瞧见您呐
You were nowhere to be found.

我一直在这 治理国家
I've been here,ruling the kingdoms.

你干得还真不错咧
What a fine job you've done.

看看你
Look at you.

弥赛菈·拜拉席恩
公主 乔佛里之妹

托曼·拜拉席恩
王子 乔佛里之弟

比从前更动人了
More beautifulthan ever.

还有你啊！你都快要比猎狗还壮实了
And you! Youyou're going to bebigger than the hound,

而且英俊多了
but much better looking.

这家伙一点也不喜欢我
This one doesn't like me.

无法想象是为什么
Can't imagine why.

我们听说你早死了，我很高兴你没死
We heard you were dead.I'm glad you're not dead.

好孩子 我和你看法一致
Me, too, dear.

死亡太乏味了 尤其是这当口
Death is so boring,especially now

世上有那么多乐子呢
with so much excitement in the world.

小姐 我对您的不幸深感遗憾
My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

她的不幸？
Her loss?

他爹可是个罪证确凿的叛徒
Her father wasa confessed traitor.

但仍是她父亲
But still her father.

亲爱的老爹都刚死不久
Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father

你俩该同病相怜才是
you can sympathize.

我的父亲是个叛徒
My father was a traitor.

我的母亲和哥哥也是叛徒
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

我绝对忠于我所深爱的乔佛里
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

毋庸置疑
Of course you are.

好了 尽情享受你的命名日吧 陛下
Well, enjoy your name day,Your Grace.

多希望我能在这一起庆祝
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

但还有大事要处理
but there is work to be done.

什么大事？
What work?

你来这是干嘛的？
Why are you here?

学城来了只乌鸦
The raven arrived from the Citadel

就在今早 陛下
this morning, Your Grace.

说枢机会召开 分析研读了
The conclave has met,considered reports

七大王国所有学士的报告
from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms,

继而宣布 这个长夏
and declared this great summer

终于结束了
done at last.

这辈子我记忆里最长的一个夏天啊
The longest summer in living memory.

瓦里斯
情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

派席尔
大学士

百姓们都说 漫长的夏季意味着
The peasants say,a long summer means

一个更漫长的冬季，一个广为流传的迷信而已
an even longer winter. A common superstition.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
摄政太后

我们的存粮足以应对持续五年的冬季
We have enough wheat for a fiveyear winter.

如果冬季来得更长的话
If it lasts any longer,

培提尔·贝里席
财政大臣 “小指头”

杰诺斯·史林特
都城守备队队长

我们怕是要失去一些百姓了
we'll have fewer peasants.

难民纷纷逃离战争 都城要被他们淹没了 陛下
The city's drowning in refugees,Your Grace, fleeing the war.

我们没地方安置他们
We have nowhere to house them.

随着冬季来临 情况只会更糟
And with winter coming,it'll only get worse.

都城守备队不是听你差遣的么 史林特大人
You command the City Watch,do you not, Lord Slynt?

是的 陛下
I do, Your Grace.

而你这个臣子难道不是听我差遣么？
And are you not a Lord at my command?

我的头衔和领地都是您的慷慨恩赐 陛下
I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.

那么就干好你的本职 紧闭城门 别放一个农民进来
Then do your job.Shut the gates to the peasants.

他们该呆在田地里 而非涌进都城
They belong in the field,not our capital.

遵命 陛下
Yes, Your Grace.

不用起立
Don't get up.

你比从前更迷人了 老姐
More ravishing than ever,big sister.

战争让你容光焕发呀
War agrees with you.

抱歉打断了大家 你们继续
Forgive the interruption.Carry on.

你来这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

啊 可真是一次无与伦比的精彩旅行
Ah, it's been a remarkable journey.

我在长城边上撒尿
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

还在天牢里打盹
I slept in a sky cell,

跟高山部落并肩作战
I fought with the hill tribes

这么多历险
so many adventures,

这么多感激之情要表达啊
so much to be thankful for.

你来这里干什么？这可是御前会议
What are you doing here? This is the small council.

是的 我知道 我相信作为国王之手
Yes. well I, do believe, the Hand of the King,

在御前会议总会受到欢迎的
is welcome at all small council meetings.

我们的父亲才是国王之手
Our father is Hand of the King.

是的 但是他不在的时候呢…
Yes, but in his absence...

您父亲任命提利昂大人
Your father has named Lord Tyrion

在他作战时代行首相之职
to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights.

退下！全给我退下！
Out! All of you out!

我真想知道你是怎么连蒙带骗才让父亲这么决定的
I would like to know how you tricked father into this.

如果我有能力骗父亲
If I were capable of tricking father,

那么我现在已经君临全世界了
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

你这是自作自受
You brought this on yourself.

我可什么都没干
I've done nothing.

没错 你什么都没干
Quite rightyou did nothing

当你儿子要取奈德·史塔克项上人头的时候
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

现在整个北境都跳出来和我们作对了
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

我试过阻止，是么？可你失败了
I tried to stop it.Did you? You failed.

这场闹剧会困扰我们家族一整代人
That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

罗柏·史塔克只是个小屁孩，一个百战百胜的小屁孩
Robb Stark is a child.Who's won every battle he's fought.

你没意识到我们就要输掉这场战争了么？
Do you understand we're losing the war?

关于战争你懂些什么？ 什么都不懂
What do you know about warfare? Nothing.

但我懂人
But I know people.

我知道我们的敌人彼此间的憎恨
And I know that our enemies hate each other

和对我们的憎恨不相上下
almost as much as they hate us.

乔佛里是国王，乔佛里是国王
Joffrey is King. Joffrey is King.

你来这里是为了辅佐他
You are here to advise him.

我来这里也只是为了好好辅佐他
I'm only here to advise him.

而且 如果国王能照我说的去做
And if the King listens to what I say,

或许就能接他的詹姆舅舅回来
the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

怎么做？
How?

你爱你的孩子
You love your children.

这是你难得的一项优点
It's your one redeeming quality.

还有你的脸蛋也算一个
That and your cheekbones.

史塔克也爱他们的孩子
The Starks love their children as well.

而我们手上正好有两个，只剩一个了
And we have two of them.One.

就一个了？ 艾莉亚这小鬼头 她消失了
One? Arya, little animalshe disappeared.

消失？怎么消失？伴着一股烟雾么？
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

我们本有三个史塔克可以拿来讨价还价的
We had three Starks to trade.

你却砍了一个家伙的脑袋 又让另一个跑掉了
You chopped one's head off and let another escape.

父亲要被气坏了
Father will be furious.

对你来说这感觉一定很陌生吧
It must be odd for you...

成了那个令他失望的孩子
to be the disappointing child.

大人 愿旧神眷顾您的兄长
My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother

以及所有北境的子民
and all our northern sons.

我城堡的墙可抵挡不了寒冬
The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter.

石料最后一次上灰浆还是伊里斯国王在位的时候
The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys,

而我担心这一辈的石匠
and I'm afraid the masons today

已经没了他们父辈的技艺了
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

在我还是个孩子的时候 我记得某年夏天
When I was a boy, I remember seeing them

曾见过老石匠们在托伦方城建造一座新的塔楼
put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

当年人们干活就是干活
Men worked back then.

今天呢 我的城堡看起来就像是
Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built

毛头小子醉后用泥巴捏出来的
by drunk children.

在夜里你能听见寒风从间隙呼啸吹过
At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.

到了下雨天 老天啊
And the Gods forbid it rains.

我还不如干脆睡到瀑布下面去
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

一座城堡的维护费用
Maintenance of a Holdfast

通常都是由城堡的领主负责
generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

布兰·史塔克
临冬城代理城主

鲁温学士
临冬城学士

通常 确实如此
Generally, yes,

但我把所有的劳力都派往南方
but I've sent all the young men off

为罗柏·史塔克作战去了
to fight Robb Stark's war.

罗柏国王 而且这不是他挑起的战争
King Robb.And it's not his war.

他别无选择
He didn't choose it.

或许是吧 大人
Maybe not, My Lord,

但他召集了封臣 带走了人手
but he called in his Banners and took the men.

乔佛里杀了我父亲
Joffrey killed my father,

你的封君
your liege lord.

你还记得你的誓言吗 爵士？
Do you remember your vows, Ser?

我当然记得！
Of course I remember!

我们可以省出四位泥瓦匠借你一周 大人
We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord.

这样你能及时修复城墙么？
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

我 我觉得还成
II believe it will.

我们可不想他杵在这一整天 是吧？
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

可我不喜欢他谈论罗柏的口吻
I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.

我也是啊
Nor did I.

但要体察下情 哪怕他们说话刺耳
But listening to people you'd rather not listen to

这是你作为临冬城主的职责之一啊
is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.

波坦大人
Lord Portan.

大人 愿旧神保佑您的兄长
My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother

以及我们所有北境子民
and all our northern sons.

把这个煮上一个小时当茶喝下去
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

你的疼痛就会消失
Makes all your pain go away.

我可不疼啊
Don't have any pain.

欧莎
野人

那再好不过了
Lucky for you.

阿多
马僮

那边
That way.

你又开始做那些梦了
You've been having those dreams again.

我没做梦
I don't dream.

人人都做梦
Everyone dreams.

可我不会
I don't.

我听见有人在谈论那颗彗星
Heard some of the men talking about the comet.

他们说那是个预兆
They say it's an omen.

他们说那意味着罗柏将从南方凯旋而归
They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.

是么？
Did they?

我可听见其他傻瓜说那代表了兰尼斯特家的红色
I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.

意味着兰尼斯特家不久将一统七国
Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

还听见个马僮说那是血的颜色
Heard a stableboy say it's the color of blood

代表了你父亲的死亡
to mark the death of your father.

星星不会为人而落下
The stars don't fall for men.

那红彗星只意味着一件事 孩子
The red comet means one thing, boy

龙
dragons.

但龙都死了啊
The dragons are all dead.

它们都消失几个世纪了
They've been dead for centuries.

红色荒原

嗯
Mmm.

嗯 嗯
Mmm. Mmm.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
风暴降生 龙之母

多莉丝
侍女

 卓耿
龙

你哥哥是怎么描绘它们的 卡丽熙？
What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?

他说它们吃肉
He said they ate meat.

但他没告诉你是哪种肉？
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

我哥哥对龙一无所知
My brother didn't know anything about dragons.

其实他对什么都一无所知
He didn't know anything about anything.

欸
Eh.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
熊老之子 “大熊”

她是卓戈给我的第一份礼物
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

我记得
I remember.

我发过誓要保护他们
I promised to protect them.

发过誓要让他们的敌人在尖叫中死去
Promised them their enemies would die screaming.

可我怎么去让饥饿尖叫？
How do I make starvation scream?

恐怕我也无能为力
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

这地方到底有没有尽头？
Does it ever end?

我从来没向东走过这么远
This is farther east than I've ever been.

不过 有的 卡丽熙
But, yes, Khaleesi,

万物皆有尽头 即便是红色荒原
everything ends, even the red waste.

那你确信就只有这一条路？
And you're sure there's no other way?

倘若我们南下拉扎林
If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen,

羊人们会杀了我们并夺走你的龙
the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.

若西进多斯拉克海
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

我们遇见的第一个卡拉萨
the first Khalasar we meet

一样会杀光我们夺龙而去
will kill us and take your dragons.

谁都别想夺走我的龙
No one will take my dragons.

它们已虚弱得无法战斗了
They are too weak to fight,

还有你的子民
as are your people.

你必须成为他们力量的源泉
You must be their strength.

就如同你是我的一样
As you are mine.

拉卡洛 阿戈 卡瓦罗 你们各自骑上我们剩下最好的马匹

卡瓦罗
血盟卫

阿戈
血盟卫

拉卡洛
血盟卫

你朝东 你朝东南 你朝东北

我们要去寻找什么 卡丽熙？

城市 无论它有无人烟，商队和旅人 河流 湖泊甚至是大海

去看看这红色荒原究竟前途有多大 在那一侧有什么等待着我们

拉卡洛…
Rakharo...

你是我们最后的希望 吾血之血

我不会让您失望的 吾血之血

你从没有过啊
You never have.

这不是个启程的好时机
This is bad time to start.

旅途上辛苦吧？
Having a rough time of it?

起码我还没死
Nothing's killed me yet.

你的肥屁股可把雪橇坐坏了，是你说要载我的
Your ass killed the sledge.You offered me a ride.

我只希望让你闭嘴别谈你那些该死的水泡了
I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.

我就是在这样的地方出生的
I was born in a place like this.

“忧郁的”艾迪
守夜人事务官

琼恩·雪诺
守夜人事务官

那还算是我过的快活日子咧
Later, I fell on hard times.

那些都是女孩？
Are those girls?

卡斯特的女儿们
Craster's daughters.

我可六个月没见过姑娘啦
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

山姆威尔·塔利
守夜人

我若是你就继续假装没见着
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

咋了 他不喜欢有人戏弄他的女儿们？
What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?

葛兰
守夜人

他不喜欢有人调戏他的妻子们
He don't like people messing with his wives.

他娶了他的女儿们
He marries his daughters,

而她们给他更多女儿
and they give him more daughters.

于是如此往复
And on and on it goes.

那太恶心了，那可不光是恶心
That's foul.It's beyond foul.

几百里格之内所有的野人都消失了
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

卡斯特却依然在这稳如泰山
Craster's still here.

他肯定有过人之处
He must be doing something right.

那他的儿子们呢？
What happens to the boys?

嗯？ 他娶自己的女儿
Hmm? He marries his daughters.

那他的儿子们呢？
What does he do with his sons?

他说他计划在去霜雪之牙的路上
He said he planned to stop here

杰奥·莫尔蒙
守夜人总司令 “熊老”

在这留一宿
on his way to the Frostfangs.

人们总是计划这计划那
People make all sorts of plans.

我可三年没见着班扬·史塔克啦
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

我一点儿也不想他
Haven't missed him.

他老把我看成个渣滓
Always treated me like scum.

卡斯特
野人

好久没喝过什么好酒了
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

你们南方佬就是酿得一手好酒 这我可认了
You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.

我们不是南方佬
We're not Southerners.

这又是哪个小美人？
Who's this little girl?

你可比我半数的女儿都漂亮些
You're prettier than half my daughters.

你两腿间那玩意湿了没？
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

你叫啥？
What's your name?

琼恩·雪诺，雪诺 是么？
Jon Snow.Snow, eh?

听我说 杂种
Listen to me, bastard.

你们全来自长城以南 你们这群南方佬
All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners.

不过现在你们在北境 真正的北境
But now you're in the North, the real North.

那小子没恶意
The lad meant no harm.

我撞见那漂亮的小杂种在和我女儿们交谈
I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters

没人会再靠近你的女儿们 我保证
No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.

现在 给我坐下 然后闭嘴
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

你这次带了那种好酒没？
You bring any of that good wine with you?

带了
We did.

我们途经六座村镇
We passed through six villages on the way here.

它们全被遗弃了
All six were abandoned.

那些野人都去哪里了？
Where have all the wildlings gone?

我本可以告诉你 可惜我渴了
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

雪橇上有桶多恩好酒
There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.

把它拿过来，是 总司令
Bring it in here. Yes, commander.

你想知道他们去哪了？
You want to know where they've all gone?

朝北…去加入曼斯·雷德…
North... to join up with Mance Rayder...

你的老朋友
Your old friend.

他才不是我的朋友
He's no friend of mine.

他破誓 背叛了他的兄弟们
He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.

哦 对
Oh, aye.

但他原本不过是个穷黑乌鸦
But once he was just a poor black crow.

而现在却是塞外之王
And now he's KingBeyondtheWall.

他都这么叫自己好些年头了
He's been calling himself that for years.

他算什么国王？某个小破冰湖的国王？
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

那斧头样式不错
That's a goodlooking axe.

新打的？
Fresh forged?

给我
Give it here.

回黑城堡再给你打一把
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

给你
Here.

喔 真是好铁打的
Oh, that's some lovely steel.

你想知道曼斯·雷德在干嘛吗？
You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?

集结军队
Gathering an army.

据我所知 他手头的兵力
What I hear, he's already got more men

已经超过你们任何一个南方的国王
than any of your southern kings.

那么他准备向哪里进军？
And where does he plan marching this army?

一旦你们往北出发
When you're all the way north,

那就只有一条路可走
there's only one direction to go.

如今是艰难时代 独居荒野很不妥啊
These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.

冷风已然吹起
The cold winds are rising.

让它们吹 我的根基深得很
Let them come.My roots are sunk deep.

老婆
Wife...

告诉乌鸦大人我们有多喜欢这地方
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿与妻子

这里是我们的土地
This is our place.

我们的丈夫保护我们的安全
Our husband keeps us safe.

我们宁可身为自由人而死 也决不当奴隶
Better to live free than die a slave.

可千万别羡慕嫉妒 老头子
Don't it make you jealous, old man,

看我身边这么多年轻老婆
to see me with all these young wives

而你却连个暖床的人都没有
and you with no one to warm your bed?

我们选择了不同的道路
We chose different paths.

噢 当然 你选择了一条只有男孩一起的道路
Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it.

你们大概很想睡在我的屋檐下吧
You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose,

只怕还想把我的猪报销光呢
and eat me out of pigs.

有个屋檐咱们感激不尽
A roof would be welcome.

我们走了很长的路
It's been hard riding.

我们自带了食物还有给你的上好铁器
We've brought our own food and good steel for you.

哪只臭手敢碰我老婆一下
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

我就把它剁掉
he loses the hand.

这家伙盯着看了很久
And I see this one staring too long,

看来得把他的眼珠子挖出来
I might just gouge his eyes out.

你的地盘 你说了算
Your roof, your rules.

我是谁？！
Who am I?!

我是谁？！ 总司令大人
Who am I?! Lord commander.

那么你是谁？ 琼恩·雪诺
And who are you? Jon Snow.

你是谁？
Who are you?

你的事务官
Your steward.

你想要有朝一日做统帅？
You want to lead one day?

那就先学会听从命令
Then learn how to follow.

光之王啊 吾人身处黑暗之中 请降临于此
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.

我们将这些虚伪诸神奉献于您
We offer you these false Gods.

请取走他们 将您的光明赐予我们
Take them and cast your light upon us...

梅丽珊卓
“光之王”的红袍祭司

因为长夜黑暗 处处险恶

长夏已尽
After the long summer,

黑暗将以山崩之势压向整个世界

死人将于北方崛起

你们这些人都是在七神的庇佑下长大的
All you men were named in the Light of the Seven!

这就是你们对待父辈的神灵的方式？
Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers?

你们如此焦急地想要唾弃你们的先祖？
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

你身上尽是恐惧的气息
You smell of fear

恐惧无能的老骨头
fear and piss and old bones.

你想要阻止我？
Do you want to stop me?

阻止我吧
Stop me.

上古书籍预言
In the ancient books, it's written

将有一位斗士自烈火中拔出燃烧之剑
that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.

燃烧之剑“光明使者”
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩
Stannis Baratheon,

光明的斗士
warrior of light,

你的剑正在等着你
your sword awaits you.

真主啊！请将您的光明赐给我们！
Lord, cast your light upon us!

This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.

史坦尼斯是我们的国王
Stannis is our king.

他下令 我们跟随
We follow where he leads,

即使我们不喜欢他的命令，国王
even if we don't like the path.King.

自从他的哥哥死在野猪獠牙之下
Since that boar killed his brother,

每个领主都想做国王
every lord wants a coronation.

我不侍奉别的国王 我只侍奉史坦尼斯
I don't serve the others.I serve Stannis.

我亦如此 但是忠诚的侍奉
As do I, but loyal service

意味着进谏逆耳忠言
means telling hard truths.

陛下身边遍布庸才和狂热的信徒
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

但是他唯独信任你 戴佛斯
but he trusts you, Davos.

假如你告诉他真相
If you tell him the truth...

真相是什么？
What's the truth?

吾在此以家族之荣誉起誓
"And I declare upon the honor of my house

吾所深深敬爱之兄长劳勃
that my beloved brother Robert"

他不是我“深深敬爱之兄长”
he wasn't my beloved brother.

我们之间没有什么感情
I didn't love him.He didn't love me.

陛下 这不过是敬语 无伤大雅
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

这是撒谎 把这段去掉
A lie. Take it out.

吾之兄长劳勃 并无后嗣以继王位
"...that my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs,

盖男童乔佛里 男童托曼
the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,

与女童弥赛菈实乃
and the girl Myrcella being born of incest

瑟曦·兰尼斯特与其弟詹姆·兰尼斯特乱伦所生之孽种
between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister.

根据继承与血统， “弑君者”詹姆·兰尼斯特
By right of birth" Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

这才是他的名字
Call him what he is.

与其弟“弑君者”詹姆·兰尼斯特
"...And her brother Jaime Lannister,

乱伦所生之孽种
the Kingslayer.

根据继承与血统的律法 吾于今日声明
By right of birth and blood, i do this day lay claim"

改成“弑君者”詹姆·兰尼斯特爵士
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

不论此人行径为何 他终究是个骑士
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

“弑君者”詹姆·兰尼斯特爵士乱伦所生之孽种
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

根据继承与血统的律法
By right of birth and blood,

吾于今日声明 吾乃维斯特洛铁王座之所有人
I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

勤王者应立刻宣誓效忠
Let all true men declare their loyalty."

艾德·史塔克获悉真相之时 仅仅知会我一人
When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me.

我不会犯同样的错误
I'll not make the same mistake.

把抄本送到七大王国每一个角落
Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm,

从青亭岛直到长城
from the Arbor to the Wall.

是时候选择阵营了
The time has come to choose.

让他们无法把无知当做借口
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

陛下 兰尼斯特家族才是我们真正的敌人
Your Grace,the Lannisters are the true enemy.

假如 您暂时和您的弟弟修归于好
If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother

我绝不跟蓝礼妥协 除非他放弃称王
I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.

但是 很多家族都已经宣誓效忠于他
Well, many have already declared for him

梅斯·提利尔 蓝道·塔利
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

史坦尼斯陛下无需向此大人彼大人哀求支持
Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.

他有光之王的庇佑
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

那么光之王手里有多少艘战船？
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

光之王无需战船，他当然不需要
He has no need for ships.I'm sure he doesn't,

但是我们需要战船来打仗
but we do if we're going to war.

陛下 除了蓝礼 我们可以拉拢罗柏·史塔克
If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.

他想窃取整个北境 我的半个王国
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.

正如你所知 戴佛斯爵士
I've always served thieves according to their desserts,

我对待每个窃贼都有适合他的处理方式
as you well know,Ser Davos.

乔佛里 蓝礼 罗柏·史塔克 全都是窃国大盗
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

他们必须屈膝称臣 否则只有毁灭一途
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

陛下 请恕我冒犯
I owe you an apology, my King.

我的职责是侍奉
My duty is to serve.

您已经选择了新的神灵 放弃了旧的七神
You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods.

愿光之王保佑我们
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

您可愿意同我喝一杯？
Shall we drink together?

不要
Don't.

向唯一的真神致敬
A cup of wine to honor the one true God.

老头子 长夜黑暗 处处险恶
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

但是烈火将濯尽一切
but the fire burns them all away.

陛下
Your Grace.

北境之王来了
King in the North.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 “弑君者”

我曾希望你能把我留在
I keep expecting you to leave me

随便哪个城堡里踏踏实实关着我
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

罗柏·史塔克
北境之王

但是你却把我在各个营地之间拖来拖去
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

史塔克 我看你是爱上我了吧？
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

是吧？
Is that it?

我从没见你跟姑娘在一块儿
I've never seen you with a girl.

假如我把你留在我任何一个封臣手里
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

你父亲会在两周之内获悉此事
your father would know within a fortnight

并给我的封臣送来一只乌鸦 告诉他
and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message:

“放了我儿子，那么你将得到做梦也得不到的财富
"Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

否则，你的家族将会被连根拔起，灰飞烟灭”
Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem."

那些人跟随你上战场
You don't trust the loyalty

你却不信任他们的忠诚？
of the men following you into battle?

噢 我赌上自己的身家性命来相信他们
Oh, I trust them with my life,

但是不能用你的小命来冒险
just not with yours.

聪明孩子
Smart boy.

怎么了？
What's wrong?

不喜欢被别人喊“孩子”？
Don't like being called "boy"?

受侮辱了？
Insulted?

弑君者 你在侮辱你自己
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

你被一个孩子打败
You've been defeated by a boy.

你被一个孩子所俘虏
You're held captive by a boy.

也许 你还会被一个孩子所杀
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩派出了乌鸦
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens

致信维斯特洛所有的领主大人
to all the high lords of Westeros.

乔佛里·拜拉席恩既不是真正的国王
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king

也不是一个真正的拜拉席恩
nor a true Baratheon.

他是你们乱伦所生的孽种
He's your bastard son.

如果这是真的 那史坦尼斯就成了合法的国王
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

对于他来说是何等方便啊
How convenient for him.

我父亲发现了真相
My father learned the truth.

这就是他被你们处死的原因
That's why you had him executed.

奈德·史塔克掉脑袋的时候 我可是你的俘虏
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

是你儿子杀了他
Your son killed him

好欺瞒世人 掩盖他的真实身世
so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

而你 你将我的弟弟从窗户推出去
And youyou pushed my brother from a window

就因为他撞见了你和王后在一起
because he saw you with the queen.

你有证据么？
You have proof?

还是说 你就跟那些爱嚼舌根的渔妇一样喜欢散播谣言？
Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?

我将派遣你的一个堂弟南下君临
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing

去传达我的和谈条件
with my peace terms.

你觉得我父亲会跟你谈条件？
You think my father's going to negotiate with you?

看来你并不怎么了解他嘛
You don't know him very well.

是的 但是他得试着了解我了
No, but he's starting to know me.

三场胜利无法证明你就是个征服者
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

总好过三场失败
It's better than three defeats.

灰风
罗柏的冰原狼

这座城市散发着恶臭
This city stinks...

雪伊
妓女

就像死尸一般
Like dead bodies.

的确 闻起来很像腐尸
A bit corpsey, yes.

和粪便
And shit.

我还以为你会愿意来此
I thought you wanted to come here.

乐意至极
I love it.

原来你喜欢尸体和屎尿的味道？
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

还有精液 大蒜 和甜酒
And cum and garlic and rum.

你竟然能从阳台上嗅出精液的味道？
You can smell cum from the balcony?

我爱这恶臭 我爱这嘈杂
I love the stink.I love the noise.

这城市让我性致高昂
Cities make me want to fuck.

这个王国也是么？
And so did the country.

这才是我的归属地
This is where I belong.

哦？那你可得小心一点
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

不能让人知道你在这里
No one can know you're here.

没人会知道
No one will know.

在君临 你不能相信任何人
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

他们都是骗子 精明的骗子 蹩脚的骗子
They're all liarsgood liars, bad liars,

还有一到两个是绝世的骗术高手
one or two great liars.

那你呢？
What about you?

我？我可不属于这里 我可是追随“真相”的忠实仆从
Me? I'm not from here.I'm a slave to the truth.

真相？
Truth?

你可是我见过的最大的小骗子
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

你为什么觉得我很小？
Why do you think I am so little?

我简直被“真相”压得直不起腰来了
I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.

噢！
Oh!

奈德·史塔克竟然真的睡在这里
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

好像他这个可怜鬼还没遭够罪一般
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

现在我得对这里做一点 小小的改变了
One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.

贝里席大人，陛下
Lord Baelish.Your Grace.

有一件事不知能否得您相助
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

当然 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

奈德·史塔克的小女儿艾莉亚
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya

我们不知她去了哪
we can't seem to locate her.

如果她已经逃离了君临
If she's escaped the capital,

临冬城怕是最合情合理的去处
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

但我在北方的朋友并未窥见她的踪迹
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.

奇怪
Curious.

如果我们选择跟史塔克谈判
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

这女孩还是很有价值的 不管谁找到她
the girl has some value.Whoever finds her

当然 你也知道人们总说“兰尼斯特有债必偿”
well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.

也许你可以问问瓦里斯是否知道她的踪迹
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

他也许会有答案
He'll have an answer for you.

不管你是否信任他
Whether you believe it...

就我来说嘛 总是不太容易信任太监们
Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.

谁知道他们到底想要什么？
Who knows what they want?

一只仿声鸟
A mockingbird.

你自创的家徽 是么？
You created your own Sigil, didn't you?

是的
Yes.

很适合你 作为一个白手起家之人
Appropriate... for a selfmade man

这般巧舌如簧
with so many songs to sing.

我很高兴您能欣赏它
I'm glad you like it.

有的人前世有福
Some people are fortunate enough

有幸降生于显赫家族
to be born into the right family.

另一些人却只好自力更生
Others have to find their own way.

我曾听过一首歌谣
I heard a song once

讲的是一个出身低微的男孩
about a boy of modest means

想方设法意图融入某个显赫家族的故事
who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.

他曾经爱上这个家族的长女
He loved the eldest daughter.

令人悲伤的是 她的心另有所属
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

当男孩女孩居于同一屋檐之下
When boys and girls live in the same home,

难免会有尴尬的情形发生
awkward situations can arise.

有时候 我听说就算亲生兄弟姐妹
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters

也会彼此萌生爱意
develop certain affections.

当这种爱意 为众人所知时
And when these affections become common knowledge,

显然 这就尴尬得很了
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

尤其是对一个显赫的家庭来说
especially in a prominent family.

但他们总是忽视一个很简单的真理
But prominent families often forget a simple truth,

就我所知
I've found.

什么真理？
And which truth is that?

情报才是力量
Knowledge is power.

抓住他
Seize him.

割了他的喉
Cut his throat.

停 等等
Stop. Wait.

我改变主意了 放了他
I've changed my mind.Let him go.

后退三步
Step back three paces.

转身
Turn around.

闭眼
Close your eyes.

权力才是力量
Power is power.

如果你能将你那点精力
Do see if you can take some time away from

从铜板和妓女身上挪开一点
your coins and your whores

去帮忙寻找史塔克家的小姑娘
to locate the Stark girl for me.

我自会感激不尽
I would very much appreciate it.

你就是阿尔顿·兰尼斯特爵士？
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

是的 陛下
I am, Your Grace.

阿尔顿·兰尼斯特
瑟曦与詹姆的堂弟

我将为你的家族奉上和平 只要他们能满足我的条件
I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms.

第一 你的族人必须立即释放我的两个妹妹
First, your family must release my sisters.

第二 立即归还先父遗骨
Second, my father's bones must be returned to us

我们将遂先父所愿 将他安葬于临冬城的墓窖
so he may rest beside his brother and sister

让他和兄妹们一同长眠于地下 共享安宁
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

那些追随他而死于君临的将士们的遗体
And the remains of all those who died in his service

也必须归还
must also be returned.

好让其家人为他们举行体面妥帖的葬礼
Their families can honor them with proper funerals.

这是个富有荣誉感的要求 陛下，第三
An honorable request, Your Grace.Third...

乔佛里和摄政太后必须公示全境
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim

放弃对北境的统治权
to dominion of the North.

从此时此刻 直至时间的尽头
From this time till the end of time,

我们都将是自由独立的北境王国
we are a free and independent kingdom.

北境之王万岁
The King in the North.

罗德里克·凯索
临冬城教头

北境之王万岁
King in the North.

席恩·葛雷乔伊


乔佛里和他的军队
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men

将再也不能踏入我们的领土一步
shall set foot in our lands again.

如果他无视这一命令
If he disregards this command,

他将迎来与我父亲同样的命运
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

唯一的区别是 摘掉他的脑袋 我无需刽子手代劳
only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.

这些是…陛下 这些…
These are... Your Grace, these are...

这些就是我的条件
these are my terms.

倘若摄政太后和她的儿子接受 我就给他们和平
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace.

若是拒绝
If not...

我大军即刻南下 让兰尼斯特家族灰飞烟灭
I will litter the south with Lannister dead.

乔佛里国王属于拜拉席恩家族 陛下
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

哦？是么？
Oh, is he?

你将在黎明时分出发 阿尔顿爵士
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

今晚的会议到此为止吧
That will be all for tonight.

能否一谈 陛下？
A word, Your Grace?

咱俩单独相处的时候 你没必要叫我“陛下”
You don't have to call me "Your Grace" when no one's around.

一旦你习惯之后 这也不是坏事
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

我倒是很高兴有人已经开始习惯如此了
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

兰尼斯特不会接受你的条件的 你难道不知？
The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?

他们当然会
Of course they are.

我们在战场上一直所向披靡
We can fight them in the fields as long as you like,

但是不拿下君临我们就无法彻底将其击败
but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.

而没有船舰 我们拿不下君临
And we can't take King's Landing without ships.

我父亲拥有舰队 麾下铁种深谙水性
My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.

他们曾起兵对抗我父亲
Men who fought my father.

他们是为获得自由而反抗劳勃国王
Men who fought King Robert to free themselves

为了摆脱南方佬的束缚 正如你现在所走的路一般
from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now.

我是他唯一仍在世的儿子
I'm his only living son.

他会听我的建议 我知道他会的
He'll listen to me.I know he will.

我明白 我不是一个史塔克
I'm not a Stark.I know that.

但你的父亲养育教导我成为一个重视荣誉之人
But your father raised me to be an honorable man.

让我们一起为他复仇吧
We can avenge him together.

你万万不可与巴隆·葛雷乔伊结盟
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

凯特琳·徒利
史塔克夫人

我需要他的舰队 据说不下两百艘
I need his ships.They say he has 200.

据说还说君临的下水沟里还藏着上百万的老鼠呢
They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.

我们能召集它们为我们而战？
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

我知道你不相信巴隆大王
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

我不相信巴隆大王是因为他压根不值得相信
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.

你父亲曾要上战场镇压他的叛乱
Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.

是的 而如今反抗铁王座的却正是我
Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.

在我之前，还有父亲
Before me, it was father.

你不仅嫁了个反叛者 还生了一个
You married one rebel and mothered another.

我生的可不仅仅是个反叛者
I mothered more than just rebels,

看样子你忘了这个事实
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

如果我拿弑君者去交换我的两个妹妹
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,

我旗下的封臣怕是会将我倒吊城墙之上
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

你忍心让珊莎任由王后摆布
You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands?

还有艾莉亚
And Arya

我还没有听到关于艾莉亚的只言片语
I haven't heard a word about Arya.

要不是为了把你妹妹们夺回来 我们还有什么好打的？
What are we fighting for if not for them?

事实比这个要麻烦的多！
It's more complicated than that!

你明明知道
You know it is.

看样子我是该回家了
It's time for me to go home.

我已经几个月没见到布兰和瑞肯
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

你不能返回临冬城
You can't go to Winterfell.

你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

我将派遣罗德里克爵士北上去看护好弟弟们
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

明日你将骑马南下去风暴地
because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

看在诸神的份上给我个原因
Why in the name of all the Gods

因为我需要你和蓝礼·拜拉席恩谈判
because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

他集结了十万大军
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

你认识他 你了解他的家族
You know him.You know his family.

我上次见到蓝礼时他不过是个孩子
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.

你麾下领主 将士如云 为什么偏偏
You have a hundred other lords

但又有哪个能比母亲你更令我信任呢？
Which of these lords do I trust more than you?

如果蓝礼站在我们这边
If Renly sides with us,

我们将是他们的两倍
we'll outnumber them two to one.

等他们发觉局势不对 就会向我们求和
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace.

我们定能把妹妹们夺回来
We'll get the girls back.

然后我们一起回家…永不分离
Then we'll all go home... for good.

我将在明日破晓之时出发
I will ride at first light.

我保证 我们很快就会再次团聚的
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

你做得很好
You've done so well.

你父亲定会为你感到…骄傲的
Your father would be... proud.

向蓝礼公爵传达我的敬意，蓝礼国王
Give Lord Renly my regards.King Renly.

如今王国四下到处是国王
There's a king in every corner now.

这是要做什么？
What is all this?

将这王座大厅回复到它该有的模样
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

人们是怎么形容坦格利安家族的？他们是征服者
Say what you will about the Targaryensthey were conquerors.

那可是征服者的王座
That is a seat for a conqueror.

我需要能与之匹配的王座厅 而不是美酒鲜花
It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.

我们找不到艾莉亚·史塔克的下落
We can't find Arya Stark.

如果她走运的话 想必是烂在某条水沟里了
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

也许吧 但如果她还活着 我们要找到她
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

只有珊莎 他们不会放还詹姆
They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.

我可不这么认为 北方佬不过是一群懦夫
I think they might.They're weak.

他们太把女人当回事
They put too much value on their women.

我们需要立刻派遣人马去找到她
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.

越多越好
Send out as many men as we can.

我相信如果你向外公请示
I'm sure if you asked grandfather

国王无须请示任何人 只须下令！
The King does not ask; He commands.

外公在战场上的愚蠢和失误
And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle

才是导致詹姆舅舅被罗柏所擒的原因呢
is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

他的生命危在旦夕
His life is in danger.

我们身处战争之中
We're at war.

谁都是朝不保夕
All our lives are in danger.

我倒是有听说关于詹姆舅舅的肮脏流言
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

还有你
And you.

我们的敌人会想尽任何言辞
Our enemies will say anything

来诋毁削弱你继承铁王座之权的合法性
to weaken your claim to the throne.

这不是权利 铁王座本就是我的
It's not a claim.The throne is mine.

当然
Of course it is.

没有人会相信这些卑鄙的流言蜚语
No one believes this foul gossip.

总有人相信
Someone believes it.

父王还有其他孩子？
Father had other children?

除了我 托曼和弥赛菈？
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

你想问什么呢？
What are you asking?

我想问他是否操过其他女人
I'm asking if he fucked other women

在他厌倦了你之后
when he grew tired of you.

他在外面到底有多少野种
How many bastards does he have running

你刚才的所作所为 论罪本当处死
What you just did is punishable by death.

你决不能再犯
You will never do it again.

绝对
Never.

就这样吧 母亲
That will be all, Mother.

不对 不对 不对 不对
No, no, no, no.

你知道你听起来有多滑稽荒谬吗？
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

轻松地进入
Ease into it.

慢慢来 带点激情
Slowly, with passion.

噢 耶
Oh, yeah.

去把你们自己洗干净 穿点衣服
Go wash yourselves.Put some clothes on.

罗丝
妓女

黛西
妓女

今天晚上你们都得接客
Both of you are working tonight.

在这儿我们可不那么办事 黛西
We do things differently here, Daisy.

这可不是枯草厅那些五个铜板就能干一番的廉价窑子
This isn't some fivecopper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

是干草厅，谁管你从哪儿来的
Haystack Hall.Wherever you're from.

我们可不招待那些
Our establishment doesn't cater

种地的和放羊的
to ploughmen and goat herders.

欧森大人
Lord Olsen.

在这里 品位最重要
Taste is everything here.

小指头真是位贵人
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

别叫他小指头
Don't call him Littlefinger.

他不喜欢
He doesn't like it.

贝里席大人
Lord Baelish.

她假装不懂通用语
She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue

好让客人们当她来自异域
so that people will think she's exotic.

其实她不过是在跳蚤窝下面的巷子里长大
She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

她好漂亮啊
She's beautiful.

不过是个不说话的婊子 但对男人们屡试不爽
She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot.

队长大人
Lord Commander.

很高兴再次…见到您
Good to see you...Again.

我想您应该知道这家店的老板
You do realize this establishment

是培提尔·贝里席大人吧
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

国王陛下的财政大臣…
the King's Master of Coin...

管理着流到众人口袋腰包里的钱币
Coin which goes in many pockets.

奉命行事，谁的命令？
Orders.Whose orders?

某位根本不在乎小指头怎么想的人之命
Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.

梅玵
妓女

不 你不能这样！不！请不要！
No, you can't.No! Please!

不！别动我的芭拉！
No! Not my Barra!

求求您了！求求你们！！ 够了 下手吧
Please. Please.Enough. Get it done.

杀了这杂种，不 不要啊！
Kill the bastard.No, no!

求求您了！ 拿过来！
Please.Give it here.

不！求求您了！
No, please.

分头行动 搜索每间屋子
Spread out.Search every house.

每间屋子 每个角落
Every room.Look in every room.

詹德利！他的名字是詹德利！
Gendry! His name is Gendry.

那杂种哪儿去了？
Where is the bastard?

和守夜人走了！求您了 放过我吧！
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

去哪了？
Where?

 托布·莫特
铁匠师傅

他们带他朝国王大道北上了
They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north.

我们怎么认出他来？ 他戴了顶牛角盔
How will we know him? He's got a bull's head helmet.

他自己做的，找到他
