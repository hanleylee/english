要点喝的止疼吗？
Would you like something for the pain?

后来怎么了？
What happened?

叛国逆贼史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon

被令尊大人亲自率兵打了个落花流水
suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.

这是哪儿？
Where am I?

这是您的新房间
These are your new chambers.

可能有点窄
A little cramped, perhaps,

但你本来也不占多大地儿 对吧？
but you don't need much room, do you?

你已经不是首相了
You are no longer Hand of the King.

哦

谢谢您  陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

培提尔・贝里席大人 请上前来
Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.

兰尼斯特与提利尔两大家族的联合
For your good service and ingenuity

多亏你的尽职尽责和足智多谋
in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,

是以 我宣布将赫伦堡及其所有封地和赋税恩赐给你
I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal...

你的子孙后代
With all its attendant lands and incomes

将世代继承此等荣耀
to be held by your sons and grandsons

万世不辍
from this day until the end of time.

陛下 我承蒙恩赏 无以言谢
You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.

这就设法弄几个子孙出来
I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.

洛拉斯・提利尔爵士
Ser Loras Tyrell.

提利尔家族救驾有功
Your House has come to our aid.

不仅仅是我
The whole realm is in your debt,

整个王国都欠你们的情
none more so than I.

提利尔家族若对我有所请求 尽管告诉我
If your family would ask anything of me, ask it

我将有求必应
and it shall be yours.

陛下
Your Grace,

舍妹玛格丽
my sister Margaery,

她的丈夫不久之前死于非命
her husband was taken from us before...

但她仍为处子身
She remains innocent.

恳请您赐予本家族无上荣耀
I would ask you to find it in your heart

让我们两家偕手联姻
to do us the great honor of joining our Houses.

玛格丽小姐 您可愿如此？
Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

乐意之至 陛下
With all my heart, Your Grace.

我远道来此 只为向您倾吐爱慕之情
I have come to love you from afar.

关于您英明和勇武的传说
Tales of your courage and wisdom

片刻未离我耳畔
have never been far from my ears.

早已深入我心
And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.

同样 关于你容貌和风姿的传说我也早有耳闻
Well, I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace,

只不过那些传说
but the tales

还不足以描绘出您的美丽优雅
do not do you justice, My Lady.

如能回报你的厚爱 实属我的荣幸
It would be an honor to return your love,

无奈我已有婚约在身
but I am promised to another.

国王必须信守承诺
A King must keep his word.

陛下 您的御前会议认为
Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council,

迎娶已经明正典刑的叛徒之女
it would be neither proper nor wise

既为不智 亦为不妥
for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason,

更何况此时她的哥哥正高举叛旗
a girl whose brother is in open rebellion

公然反抗铁王座
against the throne as we speak.

为了王国的荣耀
For the good of the realm,

御前会议恳请您
your councilors beg you

解除跟珊莎・史塔克的婚约
to set Sansa Stark aside.

玛格丽！  王后玛格丽！
Margaery! We want Margaery!

我愿意参考你们的意见
I would like to heed your wishes

听取人民的愿望
and the wishes of my people,

但我的婚约立于诸神之前
but I took a holy vow.

陛下
Your Grace,

诸神见证的婚约的确神圣庄严
the Gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,

但您的父亲 受神荣宠的先王
but your father, blessed be his memory,

订此婚约之时
made this pact before the Starks

史塔克家叛迹未显
revealed their falseness.

我就此事咨询过总主教
I have consulted with the High Septon

他十分笃定 由于史塔克的叛国罪行
and he assures me that their crimes against the realm

您对他们的任何誓约义务均已失效
free you from any promise you have made to them

诸神可鉴
in the sight of the Gods.

诸神圣裁
The Gods are good.

令我得遂心愿
I am free to heed my heart.

洛拉斯爵士 迎娶令妹将是无上之喜
Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.

你将成为我的王后
You will be my Queen

从今日起 我将始终爱你
and I will love you from this day

至死不渝
until my last day.

小姐
My Lady.

我深表同情
My sincerest condolences.

他们说的对 我配不上他
They're right I'm not good enough for him.

你不该妄自菲薄
You shouldn't say that.

你的优秀无可指摘
You'll be good enough for many things.

可他仍然以随心所欲毒打你为乐趣
He'll still enjoy beating you.

何况既然你已经成了真正的女人
And now that you're a woman,

他还能用其他方式享用你
he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.

但既然他决定不娶我了
But if he's not marrying me

你以为他就会放你回家？
He'll let you go home?

乔佛里可不会轻易放走手上的玩具
Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.

你有一颗温柔的心
You have a tender heart,

和你母亲当年一样
just like your mother did at your age.

我能在你身上看到她的影子
I can see so much of her in you.

她就像我的亲姐姐
She was like a sister to me.

为了她
For her sake,

我会帮你 让你回家
I'll help get you home.

现在 君临就是我的家
King's Landing is my home now.

你仔细看看周围
Look around you.

这里每个人都是骗子
We're all liars here.

而且每一个都比你高明
And every one of us is better than you.

罗丝
妓女

进来
Come in.

请随意
Make yourself comfortable.

这看上去也太拘束了
That doesn't look very comfortable.

来吧 看着我
Here, watch me.

亲爱的 不用这样
No need for that, my dear.

你确定？
You sure?

男人都喜欢看这些
Most men like what they see.

我和别的男人不一样
I'm not like most men.

别的男人也都这么说
That's what most men say.

如果你和别的男人想要的不一样
If you don't want what most men want,

那请告诉我 你希望让我做什么呢
then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.

我希望你能告诉我 为贝里席大人工作
I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish

是否就是你想要的一切
has been all you'd hoped it would be.

我们见过？
Have we met?

如果见过 你会不记得吗？
You wouldn't remember me if we had?

我见了不少男人
I meet a lot of men.

我想你记得他们每个人
And I think you remember all of them.

我想这是对你真正天赋的浪费
I think your true talents are wasted on them.

大人 您太好心了
You're very kind, My Lord.

请允许我报答您吧
Allow me to return the favor.

你很害怕
You're afraid.

怎么？我下面又没什么危险的玩意儿
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

而且和你的现任雇主不同
And, unlike your current employer,

我会为我的手下提供保护
I protect those who work for me.

也不为了满足贵族老爷的某些怪癖 虐待他们
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims

或强迫他们互相虐待
or force them to abuse each other.

你怎么知道这些事的？
How do you know about that?

你不是说知道我是谁吗
I thought you said you knew who I was.

有什么可以效劳的 瓦里斯大人？
What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

小指头看你的时候
Littlefinger looks at you

看到的是一个长着洞的赚钱机器
and sees a collection of profitable holes.

而我却看到的却是一个潜在的合作伙伴
I see a potential partner.

我怕他  哦 这很正常
I'm afraid of him. Oh, you should be.

他可是个危险的家伙
He's a dangerous man.

不过每个人都有各自的弱点
But everyone has their weaknesses.

你的老板自认为隐藏得很好
Your current employer hides his very well,

但实际上稍微差了点
but not as well as he thinks.

塔斯的布蕾妮
凯特琳的护卫

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 “弑君者”

你还是个处女 猜的对吗？
You're a virgin, I take it?

快走
Walk.

你的童年一定很悲惨
Childhood must have been awful for you.

你是不是比其他男孩都高一头？
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?

他们嘲笑你 给你起外号？
They laughed at you, called you names?

有些男孩喜欢挑战自己
Some boys like a challenge.

肯定有那么一两个试图强上大块头布蕾妮
One or two must have tried to get inside big Brienne.

有那么一两个  啊
One or two tried. Ah.

可是你把他们都打跑了
But you fought them off.

不过没准你希望他们中的某个能打败你
But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you,

把你推倒在地 撕掉你的衣服
fling you down, tear off your clothes.

可惜他们都不够强壮
But none of them were strong enough.

我倒是挺强壮  我对你没兴趣
I'm strong enough. Not interested.

你当然有
Of course you are.

你一定想知道做女人是什么滋味
You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.

啊 “贱人与狮子同床”
Ah. "They lay with lions."

依我看是旅店小妹
Tavern girls, I'd say.

八成侍奉的是我老爸的士兵
Probably served my father's soldiers.

也许有一位给了他们一个吻 一段情
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.

然后就落得如此下场
That's how they earned this.

为自由而战的北方战士的杰作啊
The glorious work of the northern freedom fighters.

你效忠这样的史塔克家族 一定倍感荣耀
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

我不效忠史塔克家族 我只效忠凯特琳夫人
I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

晚上梦见她们的时候记得用这话安慰自己
Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.

你要干嘛？  埋葬她们
What are you doing? Burying them.

我们不宜在此久留 得赶紧回到河上去
We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.

我觉得这些女人能够理解
I think these women would understand if

我才不在乎你怎么觉得
I don't care what you think.

我没把匕首落在这
I didn't leave it here.

快给我松绑
Untie me now.

我给了你去砍断绳索
I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't

然后就找不到了
have my dagger no more.

所以说你肯定把匕首弄丢了
So unless it got stuck in your ass on its way to your cunt,

除非你用它自慰的时候卡在屁股里了 喂！
it stands to reason that it's gone whoa!

你们在这里做什么？
What's your business here?

押送囚犯
Traveling a prisoner.

你是个娘儿们 一个娘儿们！
You're a woman. A woman!

哈哈 我操！
Well, fuck me!

如果你们笑够了
If you've quite finished up

行 行 我们这就走
All right, we'll be going.

喂 等等
Whoa, whoa.

你是哪边的
Who do you fight for?

史塔克那边的
The Starks.

他犯了什么罪
What did he do?

鬼知道呢 这年头显然连吃东西都是犯罪了
Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?

不 偷东西才是犯罪
No, stealing is a crime.

挨饿就不算 这就是你的公正
But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.

你要把他带到哪里去？  奔流城
Where are you taking him? To Riverrun.

干嘛去奔流城？
Why Riverrun?

偷了徒利家的东西 自然要在他们的地牢里度余生
Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.

干嘛不杀了他？  就因为偷了一头猪？
Why not kill him? For stealing a pig?

我只是奉命行事
I don't give the orders.

他一定对某人很重要
He must be important to someone.

让你押送他？这能有多重要？
Sending him with you? How important could he be?

好吧 你走你的
All right, have it your way,

小姐
m'lady.

我认识你吗？  你到过烙印城？
Do I know you? Have you been to Ashemark?

没有  那你不认识我
No. Then you don't know me.

你有没有去过盐石城的河边集市？
Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?

离烙印城很近吗？  不
Is it near Ashemark? No.

我没去过那里
I've never been there.

你们对这些美女作何评价？
What do you think of these beauties?

我希望你当初给她们一个干脆
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

是啊 有两个死得蛮干脆
Two of them we did, yeah.

等等
Wait.

我认出你了
I do know you.

他是詹姆・兰尼斯特
That's Jaime Lannister.

这事怎么没人告诉我
I wish someone had told me.

早知就不用去偷那头该死的猪了
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

如果真是弑君者 我肯定知道
If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.

你怎么知道弑君者长什么样？
How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?

我参加了呓语森林之战 我见过他
I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.

他们从树林中把他拖出来 扔到国王面前
They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the King.

他不是弑君者 抱歉让你失望了
He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you.

他要真是 我只带着他的脑袋就够了
If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

我有一个问题问你们俩
I have a question for you both.

我要你们同时回答
And I want you to answer it at the same time.

我数到三 你们一同开口
I count to three, you both answer.

他到底叫什么名字
What's his name?

一
One.

二 三
Two. Three.

两个干脆的
Two quick deaths.

他们可是史塔克的人
Those were Stark men.

我说了我不效忠史塔克家族
I don't serve the Starks.

我只效忠凯特琳夫人
I serve Lady Catelyn.

我向她保证过把你带到君临
I told her I'd take you to King's Landing,

我说到做到
and that's what I'm going to do.

呆着别动
Stay.

凯特琳・徒利
史塔克夫人

瓦德・佛雷可不能随便得罪
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

我知道
I know that.

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

那你还要这么干？
And you mean to do it anyway?

我爱她
I love her.

我知道你觉得这很重要
I know that seems important to you.

这就是对我很重要
It is important to me.

我嫁给你父亲的时候他并不爱我
Your father didn't love me when we married.

我们几乎不认识彼此
He hardly knew me or I him.

爱情不是从天而降的
Love didn't just happen to us.

那是我们这么多年来
We built it slowly over the years,

从一点一滴中收获的
stone by stone,

有你一点 有你的兄弟姐妹们一点
for you, for your brothers and sisters,

有我们每个人一点
for all of us.

它虽然不像在树林里偷欢那么刺激
It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods,

但却更加坚定
but it is stronger.

更加长远
It lasts longer.

这就是我与瓦德・佛雷的某个女儿之间
And that is what would be in store for me

将要发生的故事吗
with one of Walder Frey's daughters,

就像你和父亲一样？  有什么不好呢？
what you and father had? Why not?

就因为她不漂亮？
Because she's not beautiful?

因为她没有异域风情 让你没有激情？
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

你现在一定要跟我争个明白 还不是因为这婚事是你一手安排的
Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.

你当时也同意了
And you agreed to it.

你向他发过誓
You gave him your word.

对自己的誓言不负责任 你的手下也会有样学样
Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same.

你父亲一辈子活着只为了一件事
If your father lived his life for one thing

我父亲已经死了
My father is dead.

而我的母亲没有资格
And the only parent I have left has no right

指责任何人不负责任
to call anyone reckless.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
狭海中的王

你说你在火焰中看到了我的胜利
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

我是看到了
I did.

现在也一样  火焰撒谎了
I still see it. The flames lied.

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

我现在就跟那些白痴野蛮人一样
And I'm no better than a savage

盲目地相信一个火神
trusting in a Fire God.

我在黑水湾上为你的神明而战
I fought for your God in Blackwater Bay.

我带领部下来到七层地狱门外
I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell

手下的兄弟们被活活烧死 图个什么？
as their brothers burned alive, and for what?

被泰温・兰尼斯特和提利尔们从后方包抄
Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

如果这些你在火焰中都看到了 为什么不警告我？
If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?

光之王只给了我惊鸿一瞥
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

你说你是神的代言人
You claimed to speak for a God.

你会因为输掉一场战役而放弃整个战争吗？
Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?

说得好像你对战争有多么了解一样
You talk about war as if you understand it.

论打仗我可比你经历得多多了
I've been fighting far longer than you.

是吗？让我瞧瞧你怎么打的
Have you? Show me how you fight.

让我瞧瞧
Show me.

你的神明现在在哪里？
Where's your God now?

他不来救你？
Will he save you?

你的神明在哪？
Where is your God?

在你心里
Inside you.

我谋杀了我的弟弟
I murdered my brother.

是我们一起杀了他
We murdered him.

让我分担您的包袱吧
Share the weight with me.

他又不是你弟弟
He wasn't your brother.

战争才刚刚开始
This war has just begun.

它将持续好几年
It will last for years.

成千上万的人会死在你麾下
Thousands will die at your command.

你会背弃效忠你的人
You will betray the men serving you.

背弃你的家庭
You will betray your family.

背弃一切你所珍惜的东西
You will betray everything you once held dear.

而这一切都是值得的
And it will all be worth it

因为你就是圣焰之子
because you are the Son of Fire.

你就是光明的战士
You are the Warrior of Light.

你会把这些伪王一个接一个地扫除
You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.

成为真正的君王
You will be King.

你夸夸其谈 但是
You promise these things, but

你自己也不清楚
you don't know.

我们都不清楚
None of us know.

让我展示给你看
Let me show you.

凝视火焰 我的陛下
Look into the fire, my King.

看
Look.

我只看见火
I see fire.

仔细看
Keep looking.

看见了吗？
Do you see?

你看见了吗 陛下？
Do you see, my King?

是的
Yes.

席恩・葛雷乔伊
铁群岛继承人

我会宰了他
I will kill that man.

我不管会被多少箭矢射中
I don't care how many arrows they feather me with,

会被多少长矛刺穿
how many spears they run through me,

但我倒下前一定手刃那个吹号角的王八蛋
I will kill that hornblowing cunt before I fall.

他们想让你知道你被包围了
They want you to know you're surrounded.

我知道被包围了
I know I'm surrounded.

我知道 因为我到城垛上去看过了
I know that because I stood on the battlements

我看到我被包围了
and saw I was surrounded.

他们不想让你睡觉
They don't want you to sleep.

他们想先耗光你的精力 然后
They want to sap your spirit before

谢谢了 知无不言的老秃子
Thank you, wise bald man.

谢谢你教导我什么是围城
Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.

我父亲没来信？
No word from my father?

没有
No.

鲁温
临冬城学士

派更多乌鸦
Send more ravens.

您已经杀了所有乌鸦
You killed all the ravens.

我第一次看见临冬城
The first time I saw Winterfell

我第一次看见临冬城
The first time I saw Winterfell,

就觉得它像是早已在此
it looked like something that had been here for

矗立千年
thousands of years

而且在我死后
and would be here for thousands of years

它仍将在此矗立千年
after I was dead.

我看着它想
I saw it and I thought,

“难怪奈德・史塔克能够镇压我们的反抗
"of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion

干掉我的哥哥们
and killed my brothers.

他临冬城这样的地方生长 我们面对他毫无胜算”
We never stood a chance against a man who lives here."

史塔克大人想尽办法让它成为你的家
Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.

是啊 他抓了我然后对我很好
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.

你很喜欢提醒我这一点
You love reminding me of that.

这个冷飕飕的茅坑里的每个人
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit

都喜欢提醒我这个
has always loved reminding me of that.

你知道做了俘虏还被人告知你有多么幸运
You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are

要对俘虏你的人感恩戴德
to be someone's prisoner?

是什么滋味吗？
To be told how much you owe them?

然后当你回到生父身边
And then to go back home to your real father

我一定宰了那孙子
I will kill that man.

我向淹神发誓

我一定宰了那孙子
I will kill that man.

席恩 听我说
Theon, listen to me.

我为临冬城效忠
I serve Winterfell.

现在你是临冬城主
Now Winterfell is yours.

根据学士的誓言 我理应辅佐你
I'm bound by oath to serve you.

那你的建议是什么 可以信赖的朋友？
And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

跑吧
Run.

城外有五百北方人
500 Northmen wait outside the walls.

你只有二十人
You have 20 men.

你赢不了
You can't win.

等到夜色降临 就逃走吧
Wait for nightfall and run.

无处可逃
There's nowhere to run.

我逃不回铁群岛
I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.

就算侥幸成功
And even if I did, even if by some miracle

穿过封锁线 返回家园
I slipped through the lines and made it home,

也会被视为懦夫
I'd be a coward.

临阵脱逃的葛雷乔伊
The Greyjoy who ran.

家族的羞耻
The shame of the family.

不要回家
Don't go home.

加入守夜人吧
Join the Night's Watch.

一旦披上黑衣
Once a man has taken the Black

就可免受律法的制裁
he's beyond reach of the law.

过去的一切罪行都会被原谅
All his past crimes are forgiven.

我也走不到长城
I won't make it to the Wall.

甚至走不出临冬城大门十尺
I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.

有办法的
There are ways.

临冬城下有暗道
Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell

供临冬城主在需要时逃走
could escape.

前路确实艰险

但是如果加上一点点运气
But with a little luck

守夜人是个古老而荣耀的组织
the Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order.

你会在那儿找到机会

在睡梦中被琼恩・雪诺抹了脖子的机会
The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.

为你的所作所为赎罪的机会
The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.

我做得太多了 不是么？
I've done a lot, haven't I?

我都想不到自己会做这样的事情
Things I never imagined myself doing.

我认识你很多年了 席恩・葛雷乔伊
I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.

你一直在假装 可你不是那种人
You're not the man you're pretending to be.

现在还不是
Not yet.

也许你是对的
You may be right.

但我已经假戏真做无法回头
But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

都听见了吗？
You hear that?

那是北方人的集结号
That's the mating call of the Northmen.

他们想干翻我们
They want to fuck us.

哈 我都好久没痛快干过了
Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.

正想来一次呢
I'm ready for one.

大家都说一个铁种抵得上大陆上的一打好汉
They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.

没错！
Aye!

你们说对吗？  是的
You think they're right? Aye.

弟兄们 今天就是我们的死期
We die today, brothers.

我们伤痕累累地死在血泊中
We die bleeding from 100 wounds

被箭头穿过脖子 被长矛戳穿肠子
with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts,

但我们的吼声将回荡不息
but our war cries will echo through eternity.

人们将为临冬之战引吭高歌
They will sing about the battle of Winterfell

哪怕铁群岛淹没在浪涛之下
until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves.

每个男人 女人和孩子 都会知道我们的名字
Every man, woman, and child will know who we were

知道我们坚持战斗了多久
and how long we stood.

就在派克岛上为他立个铜像！
will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!

对！
Aye!

逝者不死！  逝者不死！
What is dead may never die! What is dead may never die!

冲啊！
Ah!

去找波隆 告诉他我需要四名最忠诚的金袍子

金袍子现在被牢牢握在你父亲
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father

或者你姐姐的手心里

You are a mess.

我是个侏儒 也是个怪物

你该向我索要双倍的钱

你认为我是为钱而来？
You think I'm here for money?

It is not meant for the buying of horses.

那是买什么？
Then what good is it?

如果有朝一日女孩要再见某人

然后对他们说

我跟我的族人之间可没有多少感情

这是黑魔法 就像把你从我身边夺走的巫术一样

就这么夺走了你 我甚至来不及…

或许我也死了吧 只是我还不知道

没准我们此刻都在夜之国度里

又或者是我舍不得丢下生命中的月亮 并未前往夜之国度

“去死吧”我对马神说 然后我就回来这里等你

听起来真像你能做出的事情

又或许 只是一场梦吧 你的梦 或者我的梦…

…我不知道

管他呢 把这些问题留给那些长着瘦胳膊的聪明人去想吧

你是我生命中的月亮

我只知道这个…

无论沧海桑田 世事变迁
Until the sun rises in the west

就算太阳西升东落
and sets in the east,

就算川泽干涸枯竭

魔法亦随之重生
our magic was born again.

得其相伴 魔法日渐强盛
It is strongest in their presence.

而得汝相伴 幼龙愈加成熟
And they are strongest in yours.
