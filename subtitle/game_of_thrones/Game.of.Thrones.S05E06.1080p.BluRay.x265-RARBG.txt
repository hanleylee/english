不想再擦死人了
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse

除非你告诉我为啥要这样做
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

你会知道原因的
You will know why.

什么时候？ 合适的时候
When? When it's time, not before.

回去干活
Get back to work.

我什么时候才能玩那个游戏？
When do I get to play the game?

游戏？

You tried already. You failed.

我当时不知道游戏已经开始了

Who are you?

无名之辈
No one.

回去干活
Get back to work.

你又是谁？
Who are you?

你在这里干什么？怎么到这儿来的？
What are you doing here? How did you get here?

我来自维斯特洛 和你一样
I'm from Westeros just like you.

我是贵族小姐 和你一样
Daughter of a lord just like you.

但我是独生女
Except I was an only child.

家族继承人
Heir to his fortune.

我母亲死了

我的继母想为宝贝女儿铺平道路
My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter,

试图毒死我
so she tried to kill me with poison.

被我发现了
I found out.

向无面者求助
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

于是我父亲又成了鳏夫
And my father was widowed again.

从那时起 我便侍奉他们
I've been serving them ever since.

这是真事 还是个谎言？
Was that true or a lie?

什么？
What?

我刚才说的你全都信了？
Did you believe every word I said?

回去干活
Get back to work.

你是谁？

你从哪里来？
And where did you come from?

维斯特洛
Westeros.

我的家在临冬城
My family home is Winterfell.

我是公爵的小女儿
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,

他名叫艾德·史塔克
Eddard Stark.

他死在战场上
He died in battle.

撒谎
A lie.

他被处死后 我逃离首都
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

还不得不杀了一个马童
Had to kill a stable boy.

从背后一剑捅死了他
Drove my sword through his back.

撒谎
A lie.

我捅的是他的肚子
I stabbed him in the gut.

我想去找母亲和哥哥
I tried to find my mother and brother,

可一直没有找到
but I never did.

他们都被瓦德·佛雷谋害了
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

一个恶棍绑架了我 他叫波利佛
An outlaw kidnapped me, a man called Polliver.

他叫猎狗 桑铎·克里冈
A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

他想用我换赎金 但在一次打斗中受了重伤
He tried to sell me, but was wounded in a fight.

乞求我杀了他 我不愿这么做
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.

把他留在山里等死
I left him in the mountains to die.

我想让他受罪 我恨他
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

我恨他
I hated him.

我又没撒谎！
That's not a lie!

女孩对我撒谎
A girl lies to me,

对千面之神撒谎 对她自己撒谎
to the ManyFaced God, to herself.

她真的想成为无名之辈么？
Does she truly want to be no one?

是的
Yes.

我不想再玩这个白痴游戏了！
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

游戏没有停下那一天
We never stop playing.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
“大熊”

喂 不是说好能在这找到村子么？
So, those villages we were supposed to find?

光靠果子和树根活不下去的
We can't live on berries and roots.

提利昂·兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

我没问题
I can.

你不饿么？
You're not hungry?

当然饿
Of course I'm hungry.

你这旅伴非常差劲 知道么？
You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that?

恐怕是我见过最差劲的
Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.

我不是你的旅伴
I'm not your travelling companion.

我俩互相陪伴一起旅行 因此… 
We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore

你能不能闭嘴？
Do you ever shut up?

我蹲在一个小箱子里从君临来到潘托斯
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate

路上一句话没说
without ever saying a word.

为什么？
Why?

到现在你才想来要问为什么？
It never occurred to you to ask why until now?

你就从没想过为什么提利昂·兰尼斯特
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister

决定去瓦兰提斯逛窑子？
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

我敢肯定你去过许多城市 逛过许多窑子
I'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities.

我杀了我父亲
I killed my father.

他想要因为我没犯下的罪行处决我
He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit.

还上了我深爱的女人
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

你过得确实惨 莫尔蒙
As miserable as you are, Mormont,

但至少你父亲还是个好人
at least your father was a good man.

你又知道我父亲了？
What do you know about my father?

我去过长城 见过他
I met him. I visited the Wall.

问起他手下的时候
When I asked him about his men,

他对每个人都了如指掌 无一遗漏
he knew all their stories, every one of them.

真真切切地把下属放在了心上
He actually cared about the people under his command.

守夜人怎么悼念他来着？
How do they put it in the Watch?

“我们将再难得见如此之人”
"We shall never see his like again."

哦 你还不知道
Oh, you didn't know.

我很抱歉 真的
I'm sorry. I am.

他怎么死的？
How?

我只听到一些传闻
I only know what I heard.

怎么死的？
How?

他率队远征长城以北
He was leading an expedition beyond the Wall.

遭遇兵变
There was a mutiny.

被自己的手下杀死了
He was murdered by his own men.

我们出发吧
We better keep moving.

凡人皆有一死
Valar morghulis.

凡人皆需侍奉
Valar dohaeris.

我已经无处可去了
I have nowhere else to go.

我带她拜访了布拉佛斯的所有大夫
I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.

花掉了所有的钱
I've spent every penny I had.

可她还是天天遭受病痛折磨
She suffers every day of her life.

我只是想结束她的痛苦
I just want it to end.

好难受
It hurts.

我知道
I know.

别怕
Don't be afraid.

我曾经和你一样
I used to be like you.

生了大病
I was sick.

奄奄一息
I was dying.

但我父亲从没有放弃我
But my father never gave up on me.

他爱我
He loved me

胜过世上的一切
more than anything in the world,

就像你的父亲爱着你一样
just like your father loves you.

于是他带我来到这里
So he brought me here.

我父亲向千面之神祈祷
My father prayed to the ManyFaced God.

然后我喝下泉水
And I drank the water from his fountain.

顿时痊愈了
It healed me.

现在我已将自己奉献给了千面之神
I've devoted my life to him now.

想摆脱痛苦么？
You don't want to hurt anymore?

喝吧
Drink.

女孩准备好了么？
Is a girl ready？

放弃她的双耳 她的鼻子 她的舌头？
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

放弃她的希望与梦想 她的爱与恨？
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?

放弃一切表明她身份的事物？
All that makes a girl who she is?

永不回头？
Forever?

不
No.

女孩还没有准备好成为无名之辈
A girl is not ready to become no one.

但已经准备好成为别的人
But she is ready to become someone else.

为什么是丹妮莉丝？值得为她付出这么多吗？
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

我记得在劳勃叛乱期间
As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens

莫尔蒙家族可是与坦格利安家族作对的
during Robert's Rebellion.

你有信仰么？
Do you believe in anything?

我信仰很多东西
I believe in lots of things.

我是指一些超越我们存在的东西
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.

比如神灵 命运
The gods, destiny.

你相信命中注定这件事吗？
Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

不信
No.

我曾经也不信
Neither did I.

和你一样愤世嫉俗
I was a cynic just like you.

直到我目睹一个女孩
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire

带着三枚石蛋步入熊熊烈火
with three stone eggs.

火焰熄灭后 我原以为只能看到她烧焦的骨架
When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

结果 她就在那 丹妮莉丝
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

安然无恙 怀抱着幼龙
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

你听过幼龙的叫声吗？
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

没有
No.

目睹这一切之后 人很难再愤世嫉俗下去
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

但这并不代表她会成为一位伟大的女王
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

那倒是
No, it doesn't.

坦格利安家族那股疯劲是出了名的
The Targaryens are famously insane.

就算她征服了世界 之后会怎样？
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

一千年的太平盛世吗？
1,000 years of peace and prosperity?

先等我们征服了世界再说
First we have to conquer the world.

“我们”？
We?

好吧 就算你梦想成真
All right, let's assume your dreams come true.

她见你带回这个出身仇家的侏儒 欣喜若狂
She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf.

砍掉我的脑袋 让你官复原职
She hacks off my head and restores your position.

你统领着她的大军 驶向维斯特洛
You command her army, sail to Westeros,

击败所有敌人 目送她拾阶而上
defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps

坐进铁王座
and sit on the Iron Throne.

好耶 女王万岁 然后呢？
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

然后她便统治维斯特洛
Then she rules.

也就是说 一个成年后从未在维斯特洛生活过哪怕一天的女人
So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life

成为维斯特洛的统治者 这公平吗？
in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?

她是合法的继承人 为什么？
She's the rightful heir. Why?

就因为她老爹 那个把活人烤着玩的家伙是国王？
Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?

那是艘奴隶船  他们为什么在这儿下锚？
That's a slave ship. Why are they anchored?

可能是来找… 
They probably came ashore for

淡水
Water.

看起来你打过不少仗啊 是吧？
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

把他丢盐矿去？
Salt mines?

可以 或者做划桨的奴隶
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

看起来还挺结实的
He looks strong enough.

那个侏儒呢？
What about the dwarf?

一文不值
Worthless.

割掉他的喉咙
Cut his throat.

等等 等等 等等 等等 等等！有话好说
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.

再剁掉他的命根子
And then chop off his cock.

卖掉还能赚上一笔
We'll sell it for a fortune.

侏儒的命根子可是有魔力的
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

等等！等等！
Wait! Wait!

等等 等等 等等！
Wait, wait, wait!

你不能随随便便把风干的命根子交给商人
You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant

就指望他会付钱
and expect him to pay for it.

他必须得确信这玩意来自侏儒
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

不见到侏儒本人的话 又如何确信呢？
And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?

命根子尺寸也是侏儒型号的就行
It will be a dwarfsized cock.

你再想想
Guess again.

先别杀这侏儒 等找到收购命根子的人再说
The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

丹妮莉丝女王已经禁止了奴隶贸易
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

我们要去瓦兰提斯 不是奴隶湾
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

另外 她重新开放了角斗场
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

我从没听说过自由人在角斗场里拚斗
I've never heard of free men fighting in the pits.

弥林的竞技场？
The fighting pits in Meereen?

那你可真是走运了 很快就能一夜暴富
You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich.

你面前可是七大王国最伟大的战士之一
You are looking at one of the great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

就是这位
Him.

他？看起来都六十了
Him? He's got to be 60 years old.

没错 他面相可能显老
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,

还有点憔悴 那是因为在太阳底下晒久了
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

这点人人都能看出来 但他是个身经百战的老兵
We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

歌手还为他写过歌谣
They wrote songs about him.

真的？
That true?

他赢得过兰尼斯港的比武大会
He won the tournament at Lannisport.

把詹姆·兰尼斯特击落马下
Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

鼎鼎大名的弑君者
The Kingslayer.

长枪比武 你说的是长枪比武
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

贵族老爷们打闹着玩罢了
A fancy game for fancy lads.

弥林竞技场的角斗士会把他生吞下去
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen will swallow him whole.

我单挑杀死过一个多斯拉克血盟卫
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.

胡说
Liar.

我没胡说 他叫柯索
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

卓戈卡奥的血盟卫
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

带我去奴隶湾 给我一把剑
Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand,

我会证明我的价值
I'll prove my worth.

为了我的孩子 赏点钱吧
For my children. Money.

培提尔·贝里席
“小指头” 峡谷守护者

贝里席大人
Lord Baelish.

哪位？
Yes?

原来是蓝赛尔·兰尼斯特
Lancel Lannister.

叫我蓝赛尔兄弟
Brother Lancel.

我们已经抛弃了姓氏
We abandon our family names.

好一个抛弃的姓氏
Quite a family to abandon.

这座城市已经和您离开时不一样了
The city has changed since you were here last.

蓝塞尔·兰尼斯特
瑟曦、詹姆的堂弟

我们把酒倒进了下水道
We flooded the gutters with wine,

摧毁了对伪神的崇拜
smashed the false idols,

放逐了无信之人
and set the godless on the run.

做得好
Well done.

我来是和太后商议要事
I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother.

要不要知会她我有事耽搁了？
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

一路当心 贝里席大人
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

你会发现在焕然一新的君临里
You'll find there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers

贩卖肉体的人没有容身之处
in the new King's Landing.

我们其实都在贩卖幻想 蓝赛尔兄弟
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

我卖的碰巧能供娱乐罢了
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

陛下 您觉得逮捕高庭继承人
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

是明智之举吗？
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

逮捕高庭继承人的是教会
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
太后

当然了 但教会是听从您的命令才武装起来的
Of course, and the Faith were armed on your orders.

那是国王的命令
The king's orders.

洛拉斯爵士的伤风败俗该怪罪到国王头上吗？
Is the king to blame for Ser Loras's perversion?

提利尔家族不会容忍这次侮辱的
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

提利尔家族不会容忍？
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

我才是受到侮辱的一方 贝里席大人
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

洛拉斯爵士和我订了婚
Ser Loras was promised to me.

但仍选择与男人为伴
Instead he chose the company of boys.

人们会选谁做伴侣这事还真不好说
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

确实很难琢磨透
Most curious.

就拿莱莎·艾林来说
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

从头到脚令人生厌
Thoroughly repellant woman.

原谅我
Forgive me.

我知道您还在为她哀悼
I know you're still in mourning.

莱莎是个好女人
Lysa was a good woman.

善良的女人
A kind woman.

她根本配不上这两个词 你我都明白
She was neither of those things. We both know it.

不过 我还是同情她的儿子
Still, I pity her son.

谷地的年轻领主能有一位新的父亲来辅佐
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale

真是再幸运不过了
has a new father to counsel him.

我明白在这等幼龄就失去双亲
I know how hard it can be

是多么艰难
to lose both your parents at such a young age.

如果维斯特洛燃起战火 谷地的骑士们会为国王而战吗？
If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

年轻的罗宾大人需要我的建议
Young Lord Robin needs my advice.

而我一直在忠实地为铁王座服务
And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.

那就好
Good.

没有别的事情就退下吧
If there's nothing else.

还有一件事 陛下
There is another matter, Your Grace.

一件非常紧急的事情 必须当面告诉您
Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

您曾经派我去寻找艾莉亚·史塔克
You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.

我失败了 非常惭愧
To my shame, I failed you.

但是我找到了珊莎·史塔克
But I have found Sansa Stark.

她还活着 活得好好的 而且已经返乡
Alive and well and home again

现在就在临冬城
living at Winterfell.

这不可能
That's not possible.

我的眼线不会有误
My sources are well placed.

他们告诉我卢斯·波顿
They tell me Roose Bolton

打算把她嫁给他儿子拉姆斯
plans to marry her to his son Ramsay,

一个不久前才被托曼国王授予合法身份的私生子
a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.

卢斯·波顿多亏我父亲开恩才成为北境守护
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.

是啊 靠捅死他的国王赚来了奖赏
Indeed, his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.

我们竟然愚蠢到会信任这条变色龙
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

相比和南方的仇敌家族结盟
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks

让他儿子娶史塔克家的遗孤为妻
gives him more legitimacy in the North

会让他在北境赢取更多的合法权力
than an alliance with a hated southern house.

我要剥了他和他那野种的皮
I will skin him and his bastard

就像他们家徽上那个可怜虫一样
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

要耐心 陛下
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

耐什么心？
Patience?

珊莎合伙杀了我儿子
Sansa helped murder my son.

卢斯·波顿是个叛徒
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩也是个叛徒
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,

他正向临冬城进军
marching with his armyon Winterfell.

让史坦尼斯和卢斯打吧
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

让我们的敌人打得两败俱伤
Let the enemies of thethrone slaughter each other.

然后不管哪个叛徒惨胜 我们都可以拿下临冬城
And when they're done, seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

临冬城距我们千里之遥
Winterfell is 1,000 milesaway from here.

天气转冷
The weather has already begun to turn.

所以我们要尽快发兵
That is why it is critical to strike soon

趁得势一方元气大伤之际 一锤定音
while the victor still licks his wounds.

您的凯冯叔叔肯定能召集一支军队
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

我的凯冯叔叔胆小如鼠
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.

那詹姆爵士也可以
Ser Jaime, then.

詹姆正在执行一项敏感的政治任务
Jaime's away on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

不知何时才能归来
I have no idea when he'll be back.

我也可以帮忙
Perhaps I can help.

谷地的骑士在维斯特洛也是数一数二的
The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

久经风雪考验
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

恕我直言 贝里席大人
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

你是个放贷人 是妓院老板
you have a reputation as a moneylender

却并非行伍之人
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

兰尼斯特家不用出一兵一卒
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier

国库也不用出一分钱
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

您会损失什么呢
What do you have to lose?

区区一个开妓院的？
A brothel keeper?

你想要什么?
And if you succeed?

我要北境守护的任命状
Name me Warden of the North.

今晚我会向国王进言
I'll speak to the king this evening,

让陛下签署一份王家敕令
have him issue a royal decree.

金狮旗飘扬在临冬城之前 不敢稍有懈怠
I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.

等珊莎·史塔克的人头插上枪尖
And I'll know you're a man of your word

我便知道您信守诺言了
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

我说过… 
As I said...

我为侍奉而生
I live to serve.

我明天去求他
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

崔斯丹·马泰尔
道郎亲王之子

弥赛菈·拜拉席恩
瑟曦之女

他不同意怎么办? 他不会的
What if he says no? He won't.

我们等得太久了
We've waited long enough.

我想娶你
I want you to be my wife.

现在就要
Now.

怎么了
What is it?

你是因为我们两家的安排才要娶我的吗？
Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it?

还是你… 
Or do you…

我们不能这样 现在还不行
We can't. Not yet.

为什么？
Why not?

你知道的 别人会看到的
You know why not. Someone will see.

我将娶你
You are going to be my wife.

你将嫁我
I am going to be your husband.

我们漫步在这流水花园是天经地义
We're allowed to walk through the gardens together.

你跟多少姑娘在这儿漫步过了？
How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?

我喜欢你嫉妒的时候斜眼看我的样子
I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.

我才没有斜眼 而你没回答我的问题
They do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question.

他们是很可爱的一对儿
They make a lovely couple.

兰尼斯特和马泰尔家族的一对儿
A Lannister and a Martell.

但他们不知道这有多危险
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

我们得保护他们
We must protect them.

是的 亲王殿下
Yes, my prince.

你很久没有使过你的斧子了
You haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time.

道朗·马泰尔
多恩亲王

但愿你还记得怎么用
I hope you remember how.

这是自然
I remember how.

阿利欧·何塔
道郎的护卫队长

多恩人的妻子像艳阳一样美丽
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

她的亲吻比阳春还暖意
And her kisses were warmer than spring

多恩人的刀剑
The Dornishman's blade

却是由黑铁制成
It was made of black steel

它们的亲吻则恐怖无比
And its kiss was a terrible thing

多恩人的妻子洗浴之际会唱歌
The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed

像蜜桃一样甜美的声调…     行了 够了
In a voice that was sweet as a peach... All right, that's enough.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
“弑君者”

我正要唱到高潮部分
I'm coming to the best part.

我们是要偷偷潜进流水花园
We're trying to blend in.

我不想让多恩人认出你的口音
Don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.

这首歌的精华就在结尾 真的
This song really is all about the ending.

晚点再说 看
It can wait. There.

流水花园到了
That's the Water Gardens.

我们救出公主之后呢
And once we've got the princess, then what?

波隆
骑士

我比较喜欢临场发挥
I like to improvise.

金手接白刃也是临场发挥咯
That explains the golden hand.

不屈不挠
Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.

艾德莉亚·沙德
红毒蛇的情妇

为了奥柏伦
For Oberyn.

为了奥柏伦
For Oberyn.

看 她在这儿倒挺自在
Well, she's made herself at home.

弥赛菈
Myrcella.

詹姆舅舅？
Uncle Jaime?

我… 
I...

我不明白 你怎么到这儿来了？
I don't understand. What are you doing here?

我们私下谈吧
Let's speak in private.

我是崔斯丹·马泰尔 崔斯丹是我的未婚夫
I am Trystane Martell. Trystane is my intended.

好极了 很高兴见到你
Excellent. Good to meet you.

我们没想到您会现在来 詹姆大人
We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.

为什么不让他们私下谈谈呢 孩子？
Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?

咱别做傻事 成吗
Let's not do something stupid.

这么着就叫做傻事
That was something stupid.

我们必须离开这儿 弥赛菈 现在就走
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

你伤着他了！ 他会没事的 我保证
You hurt him!  He'll be fine, I promise.

但是我们必须...
But we have to...

哦 我的天
Oh, for fuck's sake.

特蕾妮·沙德
红毒蛇的私生女

奥芭娅·沙德
红毒蛇的私生女

娜梅莉亚·沙德
红毒蛇的私生女

带她走！
Take her!

快跟我走  我不想跟你走
You're coming with me. I don't want to.

我没打算征求你意见 公主殿下
I wasn't asking, princess.

啊！ 放下武器！
Ah! Drop your weapons!

我是奥芭娅·沙德
I am Obara Sand.

奥柏伦·马泰尔的女儿
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

我为多恩而战 你为谁而战？
I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

放下武器

小姑娘打得不赖

停车！
Halt!

哦 老远就闻到君临的烂臭味儿了
Oh, you can smell the shit from five miles away.

奥莲娜·提利尔
“荆棘女王”玛格丽的祖母

我们怎么停下来了？ 继续走啊
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

谣言和嚼舌头 他们只会这个
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.

君临就是个戏园子 没别的
It's theater, nothing more.

如果他们每一个同性恋都抓
If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing,

地牢里就装不下别的犯人了
there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.

所有人都知道他跟蓝礼的事
Everyone knew about him and Renly.

蓝礼·拜拉席恩上过七大王国里一半的马僮
Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

玛格丽·提利尔
托曼的王后

所有人都知道 但没人过问
Everyone knew, no one cared.

但他是国王的兄弟
But he was the king's brother.

洛拉斯现在是王后的兄弟
And Loras is the queen's brother.

不 不 不 这完全不可接受
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

瑟曦是幕后主谋 哦 她当然是的
Cersei's behind it.Yeah, of course she is.

她想让我们家名誉扫地
She wants to drag our name through the dirt,

自己滚回高庭去
put us in our place.

去休息吧亲爱的 你看上去被吓坏了
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.

让我来对付瑟曦·兰尼斯特
Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

陛下 我赶了很远的路来的
Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.

你一定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

放下笔吧 亲爱的 你我都知道你什么也没写
Put the pen down, dear. We both know you're not writing anything.

啊 好的 鼎鼎大名 伶牙俐齿的荆棘女王
Ah, yes. The famously tarttongued Queen of Thorns.

不敢当 鼎鼎大名 牙尖嘴利的瑟曦太后
And the famous tart Queen Cersei.

请您再说一遍？
I beg your pardon?

我知道你是逮捕我孙子的幕后主谋
I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

你如果为这诽谤道歉 或许我可以
If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll

我会道歉的 在洛拉斯被释放之后
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

得知洛拉斯爵士被教廷逮捕的时候
I was as shocked as anyone

我和其他人一样震惊
when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.

我对这些宗教狂也没有好感
I have no love for these fanatics,

但一个王太后能做什么呢？
but what can a Queen Mother do?

难道王室一夜之间就不需要
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing

我们提利尔家的军队 金子 和麦子了吗
the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?

我向你保证
I can assure you,

王室与提利尔家的联盟依然
our alliance with House Tyrell remains

你们把提利尔家的继承人下了大狱
Do you expect the alliance to continue

还指望这联盟维持下去吗？
after you've thrown our future into prison?

我说了
As I said,

我没有逮捕任何人
I didn't imprison anyone.

至于你暗示的威胁
As for your veiled threats

暗示什么了？
What veil?

兰尼斯特和提利尔的联盟给饱受战火的国家带来了和平
The LannisterTyrell alliance brought peace to a wartorn country.

你真的想让国家重回战乱之中吗？
Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

我并没有相信过你父亲
I didn't trust your father.

我也并不很喜欢他
I didn't particularly like him.

但我尊敬他 他才智过人
But I respected him. He was no fool.

他知道有时候得和对手合作
He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals

而不是赶尽杀绝
rather than destroy them.

兰尼斯特家族没有对手
House Lannister has no rival.

总主教大人只是要进行询问 而非审判
The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial.

只是一个小小的听证
Just a small hearing to determine

来查明对洛拉斯爵士的指控是否属实
whether the charges against Loras have merit,

当然 我相信是不属实的
which I'm sure they don't.

洛拉斯爵士会被无罪释放 我们的联盟会继续下去
Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue...

我们当然也会忘了这次不愉快的谈话
and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened.

日安 奥莲娜夫人
Good day, Lady Olenna.

你是否注意到关于你和蓝礼的谣言？
You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?

I don't pay attention to rumors.

有人说你在他遇刺身亡后十分沮丧

证人说你拒绝离开他的棺床旁边
Witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside

甚至史坦尼斯的军队逼近之时也是如此
even as Stannis's army closed in.

他是我的朋友 是我的国王

难道乔佛里不是你的国王？
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

大麻雀
总主教

乔佛里是七神加冕的国王 蓝礼不是
He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.

托曼·拜拉席恩一世
铁王座上的王

我不该支持蓝礼称王 这我知道
I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that.

可乔佛里已经原谅了我
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

我在黑水河为他而战
I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.

没错 还穿着蓝礼的盔甲
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

我穿什么重要吗？
Why does it matter what I wore?

你否认所有对你的指控吗？
Do you deny all the charges against you?

通奸
Fornication.

鸡奸 渎神
Buggery.Blasphemy.

你从未和蓝礼·拜拉席恩同床共枕？
You never lay with Renly Baratheon?

从来没有
Never.

和其他男人呢？
Nor any other man?

也没有
Never.

就这样吧 洛拉斯爵士
That will be all, Ser Loras.

行了 我想就到此为止吧
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

教廷召玛格丽皇后上前
The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

您叫我？
You call me forward?

是的 我们有问题要问你
Yes, we have some questions for you.

我是王后 没错

在教廷审判上 不管是国王还是王后
neither kings nor queens are exempt

都不能拒绝出席作证

全是造谣中伤
They are lies.

全是？全是
All of them? All of them.

玛格丽王后
Queen Margaery,

你是否能在诸神面前起誓
in the presence of the gods,

证明就你所知而言
do you swear that your brother is innocent

你哥哥清白无辜
of these charges against him

从未犯过上述罪行？
to the best of your knowledge?

是的 我发誓
Yes, I swear it.

谢谢 殿下
Thank you, Your Grace.

奥利弗
男妓

你认识这人吗？
Do you know this man?

是的 很熟

Is there anyone else who can support your claim?

有
Yes.

有 就是玛格丽王后
Yes, Queen Margaery.

不久前她曾撞见我们在一起
She walked in on us once not long ago.

她看起来一点都不惊讶
She didn't seem surprised.

这证词是对一个大家族的侮辱
This testimony is an insult to a great house.

凭什么教廷或其他人要相信一个侍从的话
Why should the Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire

而不是高庭的继承人？
over the heir to Highgarden?

他有个胎记 夫人
He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

在大腿根上
Quite high on his thigh.

酒红色 形状像多恩
Winecolored and roughly the shape of Dorne.

闭嘴！骗子！
No! Liar!

What are you doing? Let us pass.

教廷确信已有足够证据
The Faith is satisfied there is enough evidence

对洛拉斯爵士
to bring a formal trial

及玛格丽王后
for Ser Loras

进行正式审判
and Queen Margaery.

什么？
What?
