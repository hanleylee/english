原著  乔治・R・R・马丁

第六季第八集   No One
无名之辈

吾儿
My son.

我的长子
My firstborn son.

我的幼王 安息吧
My child king, hush.

克连恩夫人
戏子

倾听神的召唤 他们为你歌唱
Listen to the gods, for you they sing.

无需再战 乖孩子
Fight no more, sweet child.

你已大获全胜
Your wars are won.

恶狼深埋地底
The wolves are buried

伪鹿命数已尽
and the false stag done.

阖上你的碧眼 吾爱
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

让皇冠落地
Let the crown fall.

天父召唤你前往他的殿堂
The Father above beckons you to his hall.

我将与你重逢在七重天上
In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.

不过我先要让贱人珊莎血债血偿
But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore

还有我的弟弟小恶魔
and my brother the Imp

他杀死了自己的国王
who killed his own king.

他生在狮群 却带来诅咒
Born amongst lions, our curse from within.

我发誓 我要杀了他
I will slay him, I swear.

无论是用绞索还是利刃
With noose or with knife,

不管是用两周
though it take me a fortnight,

一个月还是耗尽今生
a moon or my life.

什么声音？什么味道？
What is that I hear and smell?

不久我便送那人踏上地狱之道
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

他们说泰温・兰尼斯特拉的全是黄金
It's time to see if truth they told

是时候看看他们是不是在骗人
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

拿假发！
Get the wig!

你这个禽兽 你这个禽兽 杀死了我的妻子
You beast, you beast. You killed my wife.

如今还夺走了你父亲的性命
And now you've taken your father's life.

这片土地上没有比你更恶毒的孩子了
No worse child ever stained this land.

我诅咒我为你命名的日子
I curse the day I named you.

我一生最大的罪过！
My greatest crime!

艾莉亚・史塔克
“无名之辈”

你很擅长这个
You're good at that.

你在哪儿学的？
Where did you learn?

我是个好妒忌的女人
I'm a jealous woman.

却一直喜欢坏男人
I've always liked bad men

他们也总是喜欢我
and they've always liked me.

有些晚上他们回家的时候 如果那还算是家的话
They'd come home wherever home was that night

满身都是婊子的香粉味
stinking of some whore's perfume.

我们便大干一仗 我就在他们身上开个洞
So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.

过后我感觉糟透了
And then I'd feel terrible,

就再把他们缝起来
so I'd patch them up.

熟能生巧嘛
I got good at patching them up.

拿刀开洞也熟能生巧了
And good at putting holes in them.

确实
And that.

那个女演员怎么了？
What happened to the actress?

想让你死的那个
The one who wanted you dead.

碧安卡
Bianca.

在我收拾了她的脸之后
She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress

她恐怕很难再找到一份演员的工作了
after what I did to her face.

嗯
Mmm.

我一直没学会做饭
I never did learn to cook.

不过你还是得吃 你需要营养
But eat. Eat. You need it.

剧团要转场到潘托斯去了
The company is moving on to Pentos soon.

你应该与我们同去
You should come with us.

我不能  为什么呢？
 I can't.  Why not?

我预感你会很擅长这类工作的
Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.

除此之外 我们还需要个新女演员呢
And besides, we need a new actress.

我不大可能记住所有的台词
I don't think I could remember all of the lines.

跟我们去吧
Come with us.

你在这儿还有什么挂念的？
What's left for you here?

你不会安全的
You wouldn't be safe.

只要她还在找我
Not while she's looking for me.

谁？
Who?

她没有名字
She doesn't have a name.

你打算去哪？
Where will you go?

厄斯索斯在东 维斯特洛在西
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

可维斯特洛再往西是什么地方？
But what's west of Westeros?

我不知道
I don't know.

没人知道
Nobody does.

地图都在那里戛然而止
That's where all the maps stop.

也许那就是世界的边缘
The edge of the world, maybe.

我想去看看
I'd like to see that.

那是什么？  罂粟花奶
 What's that?  Milk of the poppy.

我不想喝
I don't want any.

不睡觉你就好不了
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

相信我 要是我的汤都杀不死你 那就没什么能杀死你了
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.

聊聊加廷斯的事吧 他原来帅气吗
Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.

我曾是著名的接吻高手
I was a famous kisser.

你们这些小伙知道怎么正确地接吻吗？
You lads know how to kiss proper?

当然知道了
Course we do.

这种技术是为大师准备的
This is for masters, this technique.

你们还没准备好  我准备好了
 You're not ready.  I'm ready.

他说他准备好了
He says he's ready.

好吧 现在注意了
All right. Now, pay attention.

把左手放在女士的脑后
You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.

你的右手像这样环住女士的腰
Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.

非常浪漫
Very romantic.

现在伸出你的中指 懂吗
Take your middle finger, yeah,

然后直接捅进她的屁眼
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

就他妈差一点了！
So fucking close!

啊 闻起来就跟蜜穴一样
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

看看他 你硬了吗 小子？
Look at him. You get hard, boy?

去你娘的！恶心的老混蛋
Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.

放过这茬儿吧 行吗 老混球们？
Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?

还有一个在哪？
Where's the other one?

桑铎・克里冈
“猎狗”

那个披着黄斗篷的  去你娘的！
 The one with the yellow cloak.  Fuck you!

这就是你的遗言 去你娘的？
Those are your last words, fuck you?

拜托 说句像样点的
Come on, you can do better.

臭娘们！
Cunt!

你死得屎都不如 你知道吧？
You're shit at dying, you know that?

她浴火重生 来改变这个世界

丹妮莉丝是光之王赐予子民的礼物

如果我们坚定不移地爱着女王和她的随从

那么将不再会有人将我们拷上铁链

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

可以说我下了一盘好棋
I'd call that a successful gambit.

是吗？  四处看看
 Would you?  Look around.

这个城市又重生了
The city has come back to life.

你与狂热之徒定了协议  我做了 也奏效了
 You made a pact with fanatics.  I did and it worked.

若你用一把笔直的剃刀剃须 你说剃刀有用
If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.

这不代表它不会割断你的喉咙
That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.

你说这话就像是个从来不用剃须的男人
Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.

我会想念你的
I'm going to miss you.

我知道
I know.

我希望你的观点是正确的
I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.

如果我没回来 你就知道我错了
If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.

我们需要维斯特洛的盟友
We need friends in Westeros.

我们也需要船只
And we need ships.

最重要的是 我们需要我们的女王
Most of all, we need our queen.

她会回来的 她必须回来
She'll come back. She has to.

我的心已经破碎过太多次了
My heart's been broken too many times already.

剩下的路我就自己走了
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

在这座城市最出名的侏儒身边
I can't go off on a secret mission

我是没办法执行秘密任务的
in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.

瓦里斯
Varys.

是世界上最出名的侏儒
The most famous dwarf in the world.

科本
学士

陛下 有几个教团武装的成员
Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant

被准许进入红堡了
have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.

被准许？
Have been permitted?

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

这真是个折磨人的说法
That's rather a tortured way of putting it.

他们要求觐见您 陛下
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

谁准许他们进入红堡的？
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?

国王知道他们来了吗？
The king is aware of their presence?

他知道 陛下
He is, Your Grace.

他正在他的寝宫里做祈祷
He's currently in his chambers at prayer.

陛下 总主教大人
Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon

兰赛尔・兰尼斯特
瑟曦的堂弟

希望能够在贝勒大圣堂与您谈话
wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.

随时欢迎
His Holiness the High Septon

总主教大人 到红堡来见我
is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.

陛下 这不是一个请求
Your Grace, this is not a request.

这是一个请求 蓝赛尔表弟
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

你在请求我 而我拒绝
You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.

总主教命令了你
The High Septon commands you.

你确定你想要拒绝他吗？
Are you sure you want to refuse him?

他承诺过我可以在红堡里一直待到审判日
He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.

他没有做过这种承诺
He made no such promises.

如果你拒绝自愿前来… 
If you refuse to come of your own free will

滚出去
Get out.

退下 爵士
Move aside, ser.

“劳勃・斯壮”
御林铁卫

命令你的人退下 否则我们将用暴力解决
Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.

我选择暴力
I choose violence.

请你告诉总主教大人 随时欢迎他大驾光临
Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.

看起来像是围城 女士
Looks like a siege, my lady.

你有很敏锐的军事头脑 波德
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

塔斯的布蕾妮
“美人”

波德瑞克・派恩
侍从

女士 女士
My lady. My lady.

来者何人？！
Who goes there?!

报上名来！
State your business!

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

请告诉詹姆・兰尼斯特爵士 我与他有要事相商
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.

告诉他我配有他的剑
Tell him I have his sword.

我们这个年纪做侍从是不是太老了？
Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?

波隆
骑士

波德瑞克・天杀的・派恩
Podrick fucking Payne.

我还以为你都已经死了呢
I thought you'd be dead by now.

还没呢
Not yet.

他们在里面吗？  是的
 Are they in there?  Uh huh.

你觉得他们现在是干柴烈火吗？
You think they're fucking?

什么？
What?

不可能
No.

为什么不？换我的话我会操她
Why not? I'd fuck her.

你也会的 不是吗？
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

我是他的侍从  是啊
 I'm her squire.  Oh.

反正 他会操她 这是肯定的
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

她也会干他的 你不觉得吗？
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

你瞧她看他的样子
The way she looks at him.

其实所有女人看他的样子都他妈色眯眯的
The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.

就这一点而言 我倒更愿意跟在他弟弟身边
I preferred working with the little brother on that account.

拜托 你这个有着神诺募一
Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.

你肯定已经给她看过了吧
You must have shown it to her by now.

她一直在教我用剑  真的？
 She's training me to fight.  Is she?

哇  早晨一小时 晚上一小时
Oh.  An hour in the morning, an hour at night.

天天如此
Every day.

那为什么像我这样的老炮还是能偷偷靠近宰了你？
Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?

呃 这不是一种打法
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

这下你说到点子上了 不是吗？
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

你想学学这种打法吗？
You want to learn that sort of fighting?

好吧
All right.

好吧 咱们从步法开始
All right, let's start with your footwork.

给我看看你的准备姿势
Show me your stance.

听我说 波德
Now listen to me, Pod.

看看你的双脚之间有一码宽？
See how your feet are about a yard apart?

第一课 假设每个人都想打你
Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.

因为的确是这样的 波德 每个人都想打该死的侍从
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

再来 来嘛 别生气
Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.

我没想到你真找到了她
I never thought you'd find her.

我以为珊莎已经死了
I just assumed Sansa was dead.

你为什么会这么想？
Why would you assume that?

以我的经验看 像她这样的女孩活不长
In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.

我不觉得你认识很多像她一样的女孩
I don't think you know many girls like her.

好吧 我为你感到骄傲
Well, I'm proud of you.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫

真的 你完成了自己对凯特琳・史塔克许下的誓言
I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark

尽管困难重重
against all odds.

当然 我姐姐想让珊莎死
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

毕竟她还是谋杀乔佛里的嫌犯之一
The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,

所以情况还有点复杂
so there is that complication.

你来这到底想干嘛？
What the hell are you doing here?

我来找黑鱼
I've come for the Blackfish.

欢迎你来带走他
You're welcome to have him.

珊莎夫人想从波顿家族手中夺回先祖的家堡
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons

继承她应有的称号 临冬城夫人
and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.

她准备用什么军队夺回临冬城？
With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?

徒利大军
The Tully army.

他们现在可有点忙
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

我奉命到此地收回
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

如今由徒利叛军占领的奔流城
currently defended by the Tully rebels,

所以你知道问题在哪了吧
so you can see the conundrum.

徒利为自己的家园而战 怎么就成了叛军？
The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?

国王下令 将奔流城赐予佛雷家族
Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.

作为背叛罗柏・史塔克和屠杀他全家的奖励
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.

确实如此
Exactly.

我们不该讨论政治
We shouldn't argue about politics.

你是骑士 詹姆爵士
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

我知道在你心底仍以此为荣
I know there is honor in you.

我亲眼所见  我是兰尼斯特家族的一员
 I've seen it myself.  I'm a Lannister.

不要让我背叛我的家族
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

我并没这么做
I do no such thing.

兵不血刃地拿下奔流城
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

完成你的任务 带你的军队毫发无伤回到南方
Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.

你的建议是什么？
What do you propose?

允许我举着休战旗进入奔流城
Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.

让我试着说服黑鱼交出城堡
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.

他为什么要放弃先祖的家堡？
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

因为你不会阻拦他率军北上
Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.

你见过黑鱼吗？
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

没有  他比你还固执
 No.  He's even more stubborn than you are.

好吧
All right.

你就试着和这个老顽固讲讲道理
Try to talk some sense into the old goat.

他不会听 但他的部下或许能听进去
He won't listen, but his men might.

不是所有人都愿为别人的家送命
Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.

我需要你的保证
I need your word.

如果我说服他放弃奔流城
If I persuade him to abandon the castle,

你会允许他们安全北上
you'll grant a safe passage north.

我向你保证此事
You have my word.

直到日落
You have until nightfall.

这把剑所承载的使命
You gave it to me for a purpose.

我已经完成了
I've achieved that purpose.

它是你的
It's yours.

它将永远属于你
It will always be yours.

最后一件事 詹姆爵士
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

请讲 布蕾妮小姐
Yes, Lady Brienne?

如果我没能说服黑鱼投降
Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender

那么当你攻打奔流城时
and if you attack the castle,

我必须恪守荣誉 同珊莎的亲属站在一边
honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.

当然
Of course it does.

与你作战
To fight you.

希望你我不会走到这一步
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

我已经说过三遍了 不行
I've said no three times already.

我有一封信 你侄孙女珊莎・史塔克的亲笔信
I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.

我上次见到她时她还是个孩子
I haven't seen her since she was a child.

我没见过她的签名 我也不认识你
I don't know her signature. I don't know you.

我也不会投降 今晚守卫加倍
And I will not surrender. Double the guards tonight.

弑君者想试探我们
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

我能感觉得到
I can feel it.

正如我所说 我叫… 
As I have said, my name is

是的 塔斯的布蕾妮 我认识你父亲
Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.

一个好人  他非常推崇你
 Good man.  He always spoke highly of you.

如果他在这里 我会和他说同样的话
And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

如果你认为靠着弑君者的荣誉作保
If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat

我就会放弃自己的家堡 那你就太蠢了
on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.

奔流城不可能抵挡得住兰尼斯特和佛雷的攻击
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.

我们会坚持够长的时间 长过你那独臂朋友的想象
We can stand longer than your one handed friend thinks we can.

他不是我朋友  不是吗？
 He's not my friend.  No?

布林登・徒利
“黑鱼”

谁让你穿过包围线 进入城堡？
Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?

还给了你一把刻有金狮剑柄的剑？
Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?

詹姆爵士坚守着对你侄女凯特琳・史塔克许下的承诺
Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.

他派我寻找并帮助珊莎 正如凯特琳希望的那样
He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted.

他赠我这把剑来保护她
He gave me this sword to protect her.

这是我在做并会继续做的事情
That is what I have done and I will continue to do

直到我死
until the day I die.

她跟她母亲一模一样
She's exactly like her mother.

我没有足够的人手帮她夺回临冬城
I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.

你的人手比她多
You have more than she does.

她想夺回她的家 我理解
She wants her home back. I understand that.

但这是我的家
But this is my home.

如果詹姆・兰尼斯特想拿下它
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

他可以像任何人一样 用武力
he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.

去找学士
Find the maester.

我们需要给珊莎送封信
We need to get a raven north to Sansa.

我应该写什么？
What should I write?

告诉她我失败了
Tell her I failed.

国王要下诏？
There's to be a royal announcement?

是的
There is.

凯冯・兰尼斯特
国王之手

为什么没通知我？
Why wasn't I informed?

国王将在大殿
There is to be a royal announcement

颁布公告
in the throne room

就在此时此刻
at this very moment.

你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

站在我儿子身边
To stand by my son.

你的位置在画廊
Your place is in the gallery

和宫廷里其她女人一起
with the other ladies of the court.

陛下
Your Grace...

拖曼・拜拉席恩
七大王国国王

爵士们 夫人们
Lords and ladies,

信仰和王冠
the Faith and the Crown

是撑起这个世界的两个支柱
are the two pillars that hold up this world.

一个倒下 另一个也无法幸存
One collapses, so does the other.

天父审判我们所有人
The Father judges us all.

如果破坏他的规定
If you break his laws...

你将受到惩罚
you will be punished.

经过与总主教协商后
After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon,

我们决定 洛拉斯・提利尔
we have determined that Loras Tyrell

和瑟曦・兰尼斯特的审判
and Cersei Lannister's trial

将于圣母庆典的第一天
will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor

在贝勒大圣堂举行
on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

此外 经过无数祷告
Furthermore, after much prayer

和反思后
and reflection,

国王决定 从今日起
the Crown has decided that from this day forward,

在整个七大王国内
trial by combat will be forbidden

比武审判将被禁止
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

这项野蛮传统
The tradition is a brutish one,

是腐朽的统治者为了逃脱七神真正的审判
a scheme devised by corrupt rulers

而设下的诡计
in order to avoid true judgment from the gods.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特和洛拉斯・提利尔
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

将会在七修士前受审
will stand trial before seven septons

正如先祖的信仰一样
as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.

愿七神保佑你们
Seven blessings to all.

七神保佑
Seven blessings.

陛下
Your Grace...

你告诉我的那个谣言
that old rumor you told me about.

我的小小鸟调查过了
My little birds investigated.

结果？
And?

只是谣言 还是有什么别的？
Was it just a rumor or something more?

有别的
More.

有很多别的
Much more.

你看起来很高兴
You seem happy.

我的确很高兴
I am happy.

你们也该高兴起来
You should both be happy as well.

不久之前 这座城市差点土崩瓦解
Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.

而现在它如获新生
Now it's like a man reborn.

女王归来之日 我才能高兴得起来
I will be happy when our queen returns.

不喝点吗？你俩怎么都不喝酒？
Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?

灰虫子
无垢者军团指挥官

无垢者从不饮酒
Unsullied never drink.

为什么？  这是规矩
