第五季第二集   The House of Black and White
黑白之院

艾莉亚·史塔克

在过去 每当布拉佛斯面临危险
In old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger,

泰坦巨人就会双目带火
the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,

迈开大步 涉水入海 碾碎敌人
wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

它不过是座雕像罢了
It's just a statue.

哈哈 别怕 他在宣布我们的到来呢
Haha. Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.

我没害怕
I'm not afraid.

这就是黑白之院
The House of Black and White.

在这里你会找到要找的人
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

咱们就此别过了
Here, I leave you.

谢谢你把我带到这里来 布拉佛斯的每一个人都会这么做的
Thank you for bringing me. Any man in Braavos would have done the same.

凡人皆有一死 凡人皆须侍奉
Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.

你好
Hello.

凡人皆有一死
Valar morghulis.

这个是贾昆·赫加尔给我的
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

无人唤作此名 求你了！
No one here by that name. Please!

我一路穿过狭海而来 除了这里我无处可去
I've crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.

任何地方都可以是你的去处 等一下！
You have everywhere else to go. But wait!

这么多客人 吃的一定不错
Must be good food if it's crowded.

波德瑞克·派恩
布蕾妮的侍从

要酒吗？
Ale?

塔斯的布蕾妮
“美人”

要酒吗？
Ale?

培提尔·贝里席
“小指头” 赫伦堡公爵
峡谷守护者

珊莎·史塔克

我们走之前 有学士交给你一封渡鸦带来的信
Before we left, a maester gave you a raven's scroll.

你成了个观察越来越敏锐的姑娘
You are becoming an observant young lady.

我的母亲曾说“黑色的翅膀 带来黑色的消息”
My mother used to say "dark wings dark words".

那是句古话 可这次它落空了
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

所以是个好消息了
So it's good news.

我的求婚成功了
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

我还以为你仍在哀悼我挚爱的莱莎姨妈呢
I thought you still mourned the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

要酒吗？ 给我来一点
Ale? I'll have some.

小姐… 
My Lady...

怎么了？ 是珊莎·史塔克 别回头看！
What is it? Sansa Stark. Don't look!

你确定吗？
You sure?

她染过头发 但那就是她
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

她的旁边坐着培提尔·贝里席
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

小指头？
Littlefinger?

他们身边还有一帮骑士
A bunch of knights with them.

一帮？一帮是有几个？六个？二十个？
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?

我觉得有十来个 太多了
Ten, I think. Too many.

小姐 我不认为现在… 
My Lady, I don't think this is...

去备马！
Ready the horses!

我们只有一匹马
We only have one horse.

那就再找！
Find more!

喜欢酒的味道吗？
Do you like the taste?

我不明白酒有什么好稀罕的
Don't see what all the fuss is about.

男人为什么就这么喜欢喝酒？
Why do men love it so much?

有些男人靠它壮胆
It gives some men courage.

能给你壮胆吗？
Does it give you courage?

不能再靠近了
That's far enough.

贝里席伯爵
Lord Baelish.

珊莎小姐
Lady Sansa.

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

我们见过面 和蓝礼·拜拉席恩一起
We've met, with Renly Baratheon.

他是怎么形容你的来着？
What did he say about you?

他说
He said,

你的忠诚千金难买
Your loyalty came free of charge.

看来后来有人是花了大价钱才把它给买走了
Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.

珊莎小姐
Lady Sansa.

令堂健在时
Before your mother's death,

我是她的誓言剑士
I was her sworn sword.

我曾发誓要找到你 保护你
I gave my word I will find you and protect you.

我会守护你的安危
I will shield your back

充当你的智囊
and keep your counsel,

如有必要 便献出我的生命
and give my life for you if needs be.

我以新旧诸神之名发此誓
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

布蕾妮小姐 请别这样
Please, Lady Brienne.

没必要如此一本正经
No need for such formality.

你当过凯特琳·史塔克的誓言剑士
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.

没错 这就怪了
I was. Strange.

我从孩提时代就认识凯特了 她可从来没提过你呢
I knew Cat since the time we were children. She never mentioned you.

那是蓝礼遇刺之后的事
It was after Renly's murder.

啊 对
Ah, yes.

你被指控刺杀了他
You were accused of killing him.

我想救他
I tried to save him.

但你却受到了指控 指控我的人没有亲眼看见事情的经过
But you were accused. By men who did not see what happened.

那事情的经过又是怎样呢？
And what did happen?

他被一道影子杀了
He was murdered by a shadow.

那道影子长着史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的脸
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

影子？
A shadow?

还长着脸？
With a face?

这个女人发誓保护蓝礼周全
This woman swore to protect Renly,

结果失败了
she failed.

她发誓保护你的母亲
She swore to protect your mother,

又失败了
she failed.

为什么我要把珊莎小姐交给总是失败的你来保护？
Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

她的事情与你又有何干？
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

我是她的姨夫
Because I am her uncle.

我与她的莱莎姨妈结为连理 可怜婚后不久我的爱人香消玉殒
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death.

我们现在成了一家人 而你是个外人
We're family now. And you are an outsider.

请原谅我 布蕾妮小姐
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.

经历使然 我并不信任外人
But experience has made me wary of outsiders.

珊莎小姐… 
Lady Sansa...

如果我能和您单独谈谈…  算了吧
if we can have a word alone... No.

拜托了 小姐 如果我可以向您解释…  我在乔佛里的婚礼上看见你
Please, my Lady, if I can explain... I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...

正对着国王鞠恭敬礼
bowing to the king.

你我都不想去的
Neither of us wanted to be there.

有时我们别无选择 而有时我们可以选择
Sometimes we don't have a choice. And sometimes we do.

你走吧
You should leave.

我不希望我们的新朋友在乡间独自游荡
We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone.

这一带的道路可不太平
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

何不留下来呢
Why don't you stay?

我说 你给我站住
I'm gonna ask you to stay.

停下！停下！抓住他！
Stop! Stop! After him!



波德瑞克！
Podrick!

停下 停下 停下 停下！
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

停下！
Stop!

乖马儿 朝这儿走
That's a good boy. Come on.

朝这儿走！
Come on!

不 不 不 不要这样！
No, no, no, stop!

看来你手无寸铁
Guess that means you're unarmed.

蹲下 波德瑞克！蹲下！
Down, Podrick! Down!

波德瑞克？
Podrick?

什么 小姐？
Yes, my Lady?

你可以站起来了
You can stand now.

遵命 小姐
Yes, my Lady.

珊莎·史塔克呢？
Sansa Stark?

对陌生人充满警惕 她当然应该如此
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

我看见她和小指头一道朝东边骑过去了
I saw her riding on the Eastroad with Littlefinger.

我们跟上去 小姐… 
We'll follow them. My Lady...

如果史塔克家的两位小姐都拒绝你的效忠
if both Stark girls refused your service,

也许你可以从誓言中解脱出来了
maybe you're released from your vow.

我向她们的母亲发过誓 我会保护她们
I swore to their mother I would protect those girls.

但她们并不想要你的保护
They don't want your protection.

那你觉得她和小指头一起安全吗？
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?

不 小姐
No, my Lady.

骑上你的马
Get your horse.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
太后

太后陛下召我何事
A summons from the Queen.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
“弑君者” 御林铁卫队长

这个世界上只有两件这样的项链
There are only two like it in the world.

我正戴着其中一条 还有一条我给了弥赛菈
The one I'm wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.

这是恐吓
It's a threat.

这当然是恐吓
Of course it's a threat.

我们的女儿在多恩形单影只 周围全是我们家族的仇敌
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family.

这是恐吓
It's a threat,

没有附言？
No note?

他们把奥柏伦和他姐姐的死
They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister.

还有他们那受诅咒的土地上发生的
And every other tragedy that

每一出悲剧全都归咎于我们
has befallen their accursed country.

他们要是敢动她一下 我就让他们的城市灰飞烟灭
I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her.

轻一点
Softer.

什么？
What?

别说这么大声
Not so loud.

我们的女儿身处险境 而你还在担心我说话太大声？
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried I am speaking too loudly?

不能让别人知道她是我们的女儿
No one can know she's our daughter.

那就别说她是你的女儿
Then don't call her your daughter.

你从来没做过她的父亲
You've never been a father to her.

如果我有了孩子 他们就会当街被乱石砸死
If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.

那你的小心谨慎又换来了什么呢？
And what has your caution brought?

我们的大儿子在自己的婚宴上被谋害
Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding,

惟一的女儿被装船送去多恩
our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,

小儿子还得娶那个满脸假笑的高庭婊子！
our baby boy set to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden!

我会让一切都好起来的
I'm gonna make things better.

你从来没让什么事情好起来过
You've never made anything better.

我亲自去一趟多恩
I'm going to Dorne.

把我们的女儿带回家
And I'm bringing our daughter home.

你不可能从道朗亲王手里把她讨回来
You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back.

她已经被许配给他儿子了
She's promised to his son.

我不找他交涉
I'm not going to ask him anything.

你要是率军前往 那就是宣战
You go down there with an army it's an act of war.

我不带军队
No army.

你知道她被关在哪里么？
Do you know where they're keeping her?

奥柏伦提到过流水花园
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

我会找到她
I'll find her.

流水花园：流水花园是曾经的多恩统治者送给坦格利安新娘的礼物，一座由喷泉和花园构成的宫殿，
位于海滩边。多恩各地的家庭都会将孩子送来流水花园抚养、玩耍。

还有别的事吗 陛下？
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

你要去多恩
You're going to Dorne.

只有一只手
A onehanded man.

只有一个人
Alone.

谁说只有我一个人的？
Who said I was going alone?

不要向日葵 我不喜欢黄色
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

玫瑰很不错 就选玫瑰
Roses are very nice, definitely roses.

波隆
骑士

还要有音乐 我喜欢音乐
And music. I adore music.

但不要长笛
But no flutes.

我讨厌听长笛 你喜欢的话可以有竖琴 但不要长笛
I hate flutes. We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes.

接下来还得安排吃的
Then there's the food.

吃的最重要 是吧？
The food is the most important thing, don't you agree?

我们需要鸽子派
We're gonna need pigeon pies.

君临人都好这一口 对吧？
That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?

对吧？
Don't they?

对啥？
Don't who?

君临人吃鸽子派
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

确实如此 亲爱的
They certainly do, my dear.

确实如此
They certainly do.

这真是个好地方啊
It's a fine place, isn't it?

好地方
A fine place.

我从未想过能在这样一个地方安定下来
I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.

想得美
You won't.

啥意思？
Pardon?

我们不会在史铎克渥斯堡住下来
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

当母亲逝去之后 姐姐会继承城堡 因为她是老大
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.

她恨我
She hates me.

她用刻薄的小名叫唤我
She calls me mean names and sometimes

有时 她趁母亲没有注意 拽我的头发
even still she pulls my hair when mother's not looking.

你知道我怎么想的么？
You know what I think?

我认为你是个好人
I think you're a good person.

而且你的姐姐是个坏人
And your sister is a mean person.

非常坏
She is.

我曾周游世界
I've been all over the world

要说我从中学到一个什么道理
and if there's one thing I've learned,

那就是世界总是充满恶意
is that meanness comes around.

像你姐姐这类人
People like your sister,

他们终将恶有恶报
they always get what's coming for them, eventually.

逃不了
One way or another.

是谁？
Who's that?

詹姆·他妈的·兰尼斯特
Jaime fucking Lannister.

詹姆爵士？
Ser Jaime?

黑水的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

对令尊的逝世我表示非常遗憾
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

谢谢
Thank you.

这是我的未婚妻 洛丽丝
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

幸得一见
A pleasure.

去吧 可人儿
Run along, love.

你选了个年轻漂亮的新娘
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

婚期定了吗？
When are you planning on getting married?

说正经事吧
Just get on with it.

什么正经事？
On with what?

你来的目的
What you're here for.

无事不登三宝殿
There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.

这回是好事
It's very good for you.

洛丽丝将要嫁给威利斯·布莱肯爵士
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.

哦
Mmm.

我们有过协议 我和你姐姐
We've made a deal, your sister and I.

我反对
I would have advised against that.

这也叫好事？
How is this good for me?

因为你要跟我走一趟 帮我完成重要的任务
Because you're going to come with me and help me with something important.

等我们回来… 
And when we return...

我会给你更好的女人和更好的城堡
I'm gonna give you a much better girl and a much better castle.

从哪回来？
Return from where?

南方的尽头
As far south as south goes.

艾拉莉亚·沙德
奥柏伦的情妇

你就是我的王后
You are my queen.

亲王殿下想要清静 暂不见客
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

别挡我道
Remove yourself from my path

不然我会用那把长斧好好修理一下你的… 
or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your...

队长… 
Captain...

让她过来
let her pass.

您的弟弟被谋杀了… 
Your brother was murdered...

你却坐在这流水花园里
and you sit here in the Water Gardens

看着天空什么都不做
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

奥柏伦死于比武审判
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat

依照律法 不算他杀
by law, that is no murder.

您的弟弟…  不需要你来提醒我
Your brother... You don't have to remind me.

他跟你没怎样的时候 就一直是我弟弟了
He was my brother long before he was anything to you.

他的后事你怎么料理？
What will you do about his death?

安葬他 哀悼他
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

然后呢？
And then?

你希望我发动战争
You would have me go to war.

整个国家都希望你发动战争
The whole country would have you go to war.

那么我们应该庆幸国家做不了主
Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.

沙蛇们站在我这边
The Sand Snakes are with me.

她们有人民的爱戴
They have the love of their people.

她们会为父亲报仇
They will avenge their father

而你却坐在这里无所事事
while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

奥柏伦死了
Oberyn is dead.

崔斯丹·马泰尔
道朗·马泰尔的儿子

弥赛菈·拜拉席恩
瑟曦的女儿
崔斯丹·马泰尔王子的未婚妻

而这个兰尼斯特丫头却还在流水花园里蹦蹦跳跳
And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens

吃我们的饭 吸我们的气
eating our food, breathing our air.

你还想要等多少兄弟姐妹
How many of your brothers and sisters

被他们屠杀？
do they have to kill?

让我来处置她
Let me have her.

让我给瑟曦送去她的指头 一次一根
Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.

我爱我的兄弟
I loved my brother.

而你曾给他带来快乐
And you made him very happy.

为此 你也一直都在我心里有一席之地
For that, you will always have a place in my heart.

但是我们不靠折磨小女孩来复仇
But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance.

这儿没这规矩
Not here.

只要我在位就不行
Not while I rule.

那你觉得还能坐多久？
And how long would that be?

无垢者太显眼了
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

达里奥·纳哈里斯
次子团团长
丹妮莉丝的情人

任何人都能在一里之外看到他们
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.

当然你们就找不到鹰身女妖之子
'Course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy.

没错吧？
You haven't, have you?

可是我的次子团呢… 
My Second Sons on the other hand...

吃喝嫖赌 巷斗拿手
they drink, they whore, fight in streets,

他们吃得开
they blend in.

他们在酒馆旁听消息
They overhear things in taverns.

从酒馆跟踪人到安静的巷子里
Follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys.

打断几根指头 打听点信儿… 
Break a few fingers, overhear a few more things...

在你能反应过来之前就搞定了… 
before you know it...

这没人
No one here.

我们走
We go.

这么着急？
In a hurry?

你怕了？
You're afraid?

无垢者无惧
Unsullied fear nothing.

对
Right.

问题就在这里
That's your problem.

你也曾知道恐惧意味着什么 但早就忘了
You understood fear once, long ago, but you forgot what it means.

连恐惧都忘掉的人… 
Someone who's forgotten fear...

也会忘记如何躲藏
has forgotten how to hide.

恐惧可以教你躲藏
Fear is useful that way.

鹰身女妖之子… 
Sons of the Harpy...

他们想重新把颈圈套回我的脖子上
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

弥桑德
前奴隶

套回所有的脖子上 求您了 陛下
On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace...

您必须杀了他 杀鸡儆猴
you must kill him. It would send a message.

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的侍女

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母

我觉得您不应该操之过急… 
I think you should exercise restraint...

巴利斯坦·赛尔弥
“无畏的” 女王铁卫

陛下 为何？
Your Grace. Why?

嗯 首先 他可能提供有用的信息
Well, for one thing, he may have valuable information.

但 鹰身女妖之子没什么太多值得榨取的消息
Well, the Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.

西茨达拉·佐·洛拉克
弥林贵族

你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

因为我问过他了
Because I questioned him.

您确实得到了消息… 他还年轻并且… 
And the information you did get... he is young and..

他生来自由
He is born free.

那他为什么要做回奴隶？
Why should he want to bring back slavery?

这对他有什么好处？
What did it do for him?

或许唯一能让他有骄傲的资本
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

就是让他知道还有人比他更加低贱
was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.

他们买通了他
They pay him.

有势力的家族 不愿意亲自动手
Great families, afraid to do a thing.

他们出钱雇佣穷人去替他们卖命
They pay poor men to do it for them.

那你怎么知道这个？
And how do you know this?

每个人都知道 我不知道
Everyone know this. I don't know it.

而我就是一个大家族的首领
And I'm the head of a great family.

我们不知道这个人做了什么 没做什么
We do not know what this man did or didn't do.

至少给他一次审判吧
Give him a trial at least.

一次公正的审判
A fair trial.

给所有弥林的人民看看
Show all the citizens of Meereen

你比那些想要推翻你的人更好
that you are better than those who would depose you.

告诉他们文明社会是什么样的
Teach them a better way.

我不知道老骑士从何而来
I do not know the place from where old ser comes.

可能你们那里处事不同
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

但是在这 在弥林 在“风暴降生”丹妮莉丝到来之前
But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn

他们奴役我们
they own us.

所以我们了解他们… 
So we learn much about them...

否则早就死光了
or we do not live long.

他们的嘴脸我早已认清
They teach me what they are.

怜悯 公正的审判… 
Mercy, fair trial...

这些对他们来说毫无意义
these mean nothing to them.

他们所理解的只有鲜血
All they understand is blood.

感谢你们的意见和建议
Thank you all for your council.

陛下… 
Your Grace...

请听我一言 求您了
a word, please, I beg you.

要说什么？
About what?

您的父亲
About your father.

关于疯王 疯王？
About the Mad King. The Mad King?

你是想再重复一遍逆贼的谣言么？
You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?

那就再听一遍
Consider me reminded.

陛下… 
Your Grace...

我曾是他的御林铁卫
I served in his Kingsguard.

很早就随侍左右
I was at his side from the first.

他们没有说谎
Your enemies did not lie.

接着说
Go on.

当人们站起来反抗他的统治时
When the people rose and revolted against him

您的父亲割下了他们的舌头扔进火堆
your father set their tongues cast them in flames.

在父亲面前杀掉儿子
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

用野火将人活活烧死
He burned men alive with wildfire

在他们痛苦尖叫的时候他狂笑不止
and laughed as they screamed,

他的这些举动导致了内患重重
and his efforts to stamp out dissent

最终引起的叛乱战争 害死了所有的坦格利安族人
led to a rebellion that killed every Targaryen...

仅有两个幸存
except two.

我不是我父亲
I'm not my father.

确实 陛下 感谢诸神
No, Your Grace, thank the gods.

可疯王自以为对敌人的处置是公正的
But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.

而且每次 这都让他感受到权力… 
And each time, it made him feel powerful...

和正义感… 
and right...

直到最后
until the very end.

在鹰身女妖之子接受公正审判前 我是不会处死他们的
I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.

陛下圣明
Your Grace.

提利昂·兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

外面人挺多
There's a bulk.

是啊 最好小心点
Yes, best be careful.

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

你多少也吃点东西吧
You might accidentally consume some solid food.

我说要跟你走的时候 原话可没歧义吧？
When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions?

除此之外 在这破箱子里我还能做什么？
Besides, what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box?

你不喜欢？ 我想出去走走
You don't like it? I want to take a walk.

不行
You can't.

瑟曦放出话来 谁献上你的人头 就封他为领主
Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.

她应该为他分开双腿
She ought to offer her cunt.

我身上最好的部分换她身上最好的部分
Best part of her for the best part of me.

呃 这样说来 我看被装在盒子里也好不到哪儿去
Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.

我们真的要一直讨论这些毫无意义的事情吗？
Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis

去瓦兰提斯的路可远着
talking about the futility of everything.

你说得对 毫无意义
You're right, there's no point.

去瓦兰提斯？
The road to Volantis?

你不是说去弥林么 去瓦兰提斯干嘛？
You said we are going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?

那是去弥林的必经之路
The road to Meereen.

到了弥林之后你想找到什么呢？
And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?

我说过 一个统治者
I told you. A ruler.

但是你已经有一个统治者了
But you've already got a ruler.

大家都有统治者
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

这路上随便一坨屎
Every pile of shit on the side of every road

都插着不知道谁家的旗帜
has someone's banner hanging from it.

你挺能干的 你知道吗？
You are quite good, do you know?

在治国方面
At ruling.

在你短暂的首相任期
During your brief tenure as Hand.

我那哪里是治国 我不过是个仆人
I didn't rule, I was a servant.

不过 依然是个人才
Still, a man of talent.

比方说很会杀人？
Managed to kill a lot of people?

不错 不过你在其他方面也很有潜力
Yes, but you showed great promise in other areas as well.

她劝我离开君临
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

她恳求我
She begged me.

我没走
I wouldn't go.

为什么？
Why?

因为我喜欢那儿
'Cause I liked it.

权力… 
Power...

即便只是个仆人
even as a servant.

人们追随首领
People follow leaders

但却永远不会追随我们
and they will never follow us.

他们说我们让人讨厌
They find us repulsive.

我都觉得我们挺讨厌的
I find us repulsive.

我们也觉得他们讨厌 所以
And we find them... repulsive, which is why

我们把自己搁在舒服的大盒子里
we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes

远离他们
to keep them away.

然而… 
And yet...

不管我们怎么做… 
no matter what we do...

像你我这样的人 永远无法满足于困在盒子之内
people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box.

困不了多久
Not for long.

你说的对
You're right.

那我们来散个步吧 不行
Let's go for a walk. No.

这个世界上有多少侏儒？
How many dwarves are there in the world?

难道瑟曦要把他们都杀了不成？
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

科本
被剥夺项链的学士

不是他
Not him.

你们想骗太后？
You're trying to deceive your queen?

马林·特兰
御林铁卫

要我把他关起来吗 陛下？
Should I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

没那个必要 马林爵士
It won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

我可不想让其他的猎人灰心
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

错误是难免的
Mistakes will be made.

谢谢您 陛下 谢谢
Thank you, Your Grace. Thanks.

谢谢您 陛下 谢谢您
Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.

把头拿走
Take the head.

让我来 陛下
Let me, Your Grace.

如果您不介意 把这颗头给我吧
I would take it if you don't mind.

我的研究用得到
It could prove useful for my work.

给你了
Very good.

放那边就好
Over there would be fine.

听见了吗 拿那边去
You heard the man, over there.

梅斯·提利尔
高庭公爵 玛格丽·提利尔之父
海政大臣

派席尔
大学士

凯冯·兰尼斯特
泰温公爵之弟

这是国王之手的座位
You're the hand of the King.

当然 叔叔
No, uncle.

显然这个职位并不是给女人准备的
Clearly, it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role.

等我儿子成年了 他会任命自己的首相 我不过暂时替他代理国事
I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

陛下 我愿意暂代首相一职
Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand

直到国王成年之…  您是个好人 提利尔大人
until he becomes full... You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

但是我怕您难以分身
but I don't imagine we'll have the time.

除了海政大臣之外
In addition to be Master of Ships,

国王决定任命您为财务大臣
the King has appointed you Master of Coin.

噢 陛下
Oh, Your Grace.

他说您在财政方面的经验和智慧无人能及
He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled.

他说他将很荣幸由您来代表皇家利益
He said he would be honored to have you represent the Crown's interest in the same.

这是我的荣幸 陛下
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

陛陛陛下 从前 在某些情况下
YYYour Grace, in the past, on several occasions,

大学士也曾代理过首相职务
a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.

国王已经任命科本为新的情报总管
The King's named Qyburn the new Master of Whispers.

陛下
Your Grace,

这这个人？这这个学城的耻辱？
thisthis man? ThThis embarassment to the Citadel?

陛下… 
Your Grace...

他何德何能担此大任？
what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?

就凭他的忠诚 大学士
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

远超之前那个太监
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

以及其他很多人
Far more than many ever have.

我得说…  我不能…
I must say... I can not...

凯冯叔叔
Uncle Kevan,

作为兰尼斯特军队的指挥官
in light of your position as Commander of the Lannister Armies,

如果你愿意出任军务大臣 国王会非常高兴的
it would please the King if you would serve as his Master of War.

没有人比你更适合这个职位了
No man living better deserves the title.

你这么说太客气了
That is kind of you to say.

不过我想听国王本人跟我说
I would like to hear it from the King himself.

国王这会儿可没空
Well, the King is very busy at this moment.

他应该来这儿的 学习治国之道
He should be here, learning what it means to rule.

他正在学习
He is learning.

而这一次 作为统治者
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,

他指定我代言
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

我回君临是来向我哥哥致敬的
I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother,

也向你致意
and to you,

也为了向国王效命
and to serve the King.

而不是回来当你的木偶
I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet.

看你把御前会议搞得乌烟瘴气
To watch you stack the Small Council with sycophants.

把你的兄弟赶走… 
Sending your own brother away...

我的弟弟是去执行秘密的外交任务
My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

什么任务？
What mission?

这和你这个军务大臣没什么关系
That is not your concern as Master of War.

我可不认为你有权力命令我
I do not recognize your authority to dictat

告诉我哪些事情该我关心
what is and is not my concern.

你是国王的母亲
You are the Queen Mother.

仅此而已
Nothing more.

在你的国王急需你的时候 你要抛弃他吗？
You would abandon your king in his time of need?

如果他真要找我 我在凯岩城
If he wants to send for me, I'll be waiting for him.

随时恭候
At Casterly Rock.

加油 你认识这个的
Come on, you know this one.

它看起来像个动物
It looks like an animal.

蛇
Snake.

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿和妻子

SSSn… “蛇”
SSSn... "S".

是个“S” 对 很好
It's an "S". Right, very good.

山姆威尔·塔利
“杀手” 守夜人事务官

嘿 你们知道吗？
Hmm, did you know

史上最年轻的总司令欧斯里克·史塔克
that the youngest Lord Commander in history,

被选上的时候只有10岁
Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?

我认识“S”
I know "S".

你会学会的 我保证
You'll learn, I promise.

我教过戴渥斯爵士
I taught Ser Davos.

希琳·拜拉席恩
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的女儿

老人家学新事物可慢了
Old people are terrible at learning new things.

当然 你是个很棒的老师
Well, you are a wonderful teacher.

非常有耐心
Very patient.

我不过是跟你说识字这事
I only said that the more time that you spend practicing

熟能生巧
the faster you will be able to read.

没错
That's all right.

我们进展不错
We're doing just fine.

我想你跟欧斯里克·史塔克还有很多要聊的
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.

你几岁识的字？
How old were you when you learned how to read?

三岁 三岁？
3. 3?

是你母亲教你的吗？
Were you taught by your mother?

不是
No.

是我们的克里森学士
Our Maester Cressen did.

我有好多时间可以用来练习 我母亲不让我出去 因为...
I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...

你们南方人叫它什么？ 你脸上的这个
What do you call it in the south? What happened to your face.

灰鳞病
Grayscale.

在长城以北你们叫它什么？
What would you call it in the north of the Wall?

我不知道
I don't know.

但是我有两个姐姐得了这个 他们都死了
But two of my sisters had it. They both died.

他们怎么治好你的？
How did they cure you?

我不记得了 那会儿我还是婴儿
I don't remember. I was a baby.

肯定来了很多人用了很多方法 我想
A lot of people came and tried, I think.

不管怎样 这病是好了
Whatever they did, it went away.

你的姐姐们发生了什么
What happened to your sisters?

我父亲把她们都赶出去了 赶出了堡垒
My father made them move out to the keep, outside.

不许我们接近她们
None of us were allowed to go near them.

但是我们都能听到她们 尤其是夜里
But we heard them, especially at night.

她们听起来越来越不像她们
They started to sound not like themselves.

你见过她们吗？
Did you ever see them?

只见过一次 在最后的时候
Only once, at the end.

那东西盖满了她们全身
They were covered with it.

她们的脸上 手上 她们变得像动物一样
Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals.

我父亲不得不用绳子把她们捆住拖到树林里去
My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.

他在树林里对她们做什么了？
What did he do with them in the woods?

母亲
Mother.

你们退下
Leave us.

赛丽丝·佛罗伦
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩之王后

殿下
Your Grace.

你得离那个女孩远点
You need to stay away from that girl.

为什么？ 她是个野人
Why? She's a wildling.

她的名字叫吉莉
Her name's Gilly.

她人很好 我教她怎么读书
She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.

她是个野人 你的父亲打败了他们的人
She's a wildling. Your father defeated her people.

他以叛国罪处死了他们的国王
He executed their king for treason.

他们可以对付你 以此来报复你父亲
They could strike at him by striking at you.

吉莉不会那样做的
Gilly wouldn't do that.

你不知人心难测
You have no idea what people will do.

读了这么多书 你还是什么都不懂
All your books and you still don't know.

我下令把曼斯雷德烧死
I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.

琼恩·雪诺
守夜人事务官

你却阻挠我的命令
You prevented that order from being carried out.

你同情曼斯·雷德
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

国王的命令就是法律
The King's word is law.

也许你应该问问戴佛斯爵士我对犯法者有多少同情
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

如果显得太仁慈 人民就不再惧怕你了
Show too much kindness, people won't fear you.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩
长城上的王

如果他们不惧怕你 他们就不会跟随你
If they don't fear you, they don't follow you.

恕我直言 陛下 自由民永远不会跟随你
With respect, Your Grace, the Free Folk will never follow you

不管你做什么
no matter what you do.

你把他们的国王活活烧死了
You're the man who burned their king alive.

该谁来当他们的国王了？
Who then?

你么？
You?

不可能 只有自由民才能领导自由民
No. Only one of their own.

你认识这个可怜的女孩吗？
Do you know this wretched girl?

莱安娜.莫尔蒙 莫尔蒙总司令的侄女
Lyanna Mormont. Lord Commander's niece.

熊岛女士
Lady of Bear Island.

一个十岁的孩子
And a child of ten.

我让她的家族臣服于我 这就是她的回复
I asked her to commit her house to my court. That's her response.

除了北境之王史塔克
Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North,

熊岛不知道还有别的君王
whose name is Stark.

这好笑吗
That amuses you.

抱歉 陛下
I apologize, Your Grace.

北境人有点像自由民
Northerners commit a bit like the Free Folk.

只忠实于自己人
Loyal to their own.

我知道
I know.

我哥哥劳勃经常大声抱怨
My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly about how difficult it was

要控制他们有多难
to control them.

即使有你父亲的帮助也是如此
Even with your father's help.

今晚 守夜人会选出新任总司令
Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander.

戴佛斯·席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

艾里沙·索恩爵士会赢
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

很有可能 一个友善的人
Most likely. One pleasant man.

他认为你是叛徒
He thinks you're a traitor.

如果索恩当了总司令
What's your life gonna be like here at the Wall,

你在长城的日子会好过吗? 我想不会
with Thorne in command? Unpleasant, I expect.

你的勇敢让他显得软弱
Your bravery made him look weak.

他会为此惩罚你的
He'll punish you for it.

而我不会惩罚勇敢的人
I don't punish men for bravery.

我嘉奖他们
I reward them.

毫无疑问 陛下
I don't doubt that, Your Grace.

但我是守夜人
But I am a brother of the Night's Watch.

我已经以我的生命 荣耀和剑发誓为守夜人军团效命
I have pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

我不知道自己还能给您什么
I don't know what I have left to give you.

你能给我北境
You can give me the North.

我不能
I can't.

即便我想给也给不了 我是个私生子
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard.

我姓雪诺
A Snow.

弯下膝盖 将剑放在我脚边
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

宣誓为我效忠 等站起来 你就成了琼恩·史塔克
Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

临冬城公爵
Lord of Winterfell.

他大笔一挥就能让你成为史塔克
He'll make you a Stark with a stroke of a pen.

我打记事起就希望能这样
It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.

我曾幻想父亲去求国王
I daydreamed that my father would ask the king.

这样我就再也不是临冬城的私生子了
Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again.

不 这是你应得的 真的
No, you deserve that. You do.

我 我太为你高兴了
II couldn't be happier for you.

我要拒绝他
I'm gonna refuse him.

可是… 
But...

你可以成为临冬城公爵呀
you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

我向守夜人军团发过誓
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

如果我不把自己的誓言当回事
If I don't take my own word seriously,

那我算哪门子的临冬城公爵?
what sort of Lord of Winterfell would that be?

喂
Hey.

都来啦 还以为有炖野味吃呢
Crowded, You'd think we were serving venison stew.

伊蒙·坦格利安
守夜人学士

在我们投票选出
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates...

奥赛尔·亚威克
守夜人的首席工匠

第九百九十八任守夜人军团总司令之前
before we cast our tokens...

有没有人想要为候选人说两句?
for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

艾里沙·索恩爵士不仅是一位骑士
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,

而且品行高贵
he's a man of true nobility.

在长城遭遇攻击时 他是代理司令
He was Acting Commander when the Wall came under attack

领导我们击退了野人
and led us to victory against the wildlings.

对
Yes.

他身经百战
He's a veteran of 100 battles

大半辈子都是守夜人和长城的守护者
and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life.

杰诺斯·史林特
守夜人
前都城守备队队长

不错
Nice.

他是唯一真正的选择 没错
He's the only true choice. Yes.

没错
Yes.

丹尼斯·梅利斯特爵士还是个孩子时就加入了守夜人军团
Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy

他效力的时间比任何游骑兵都要长
and has served loyally longer than any other Ranger.

没错  足有十个冬天
That's right. Through ten winters he served.

作为影子塔的指挥官
As Commander of the Shadow Tower...

他一直将野人挡在门外
he kept the wildlings away.

没人能比他做得更出色
We could do no better.

如果没有其他人了… 
If there's no one else...

我们就开始投票
we will begin the voting.

又一个野人的情人 就像他的朋友琼恩·雪诺一样
Another wildling lover, just like his friend, Jon Snow.

杀手 你的情人怎么样了?
How's your lady love, Slayer?

她叫吉莉
Her name is Gilly.

史林特爵士和她熟
Ser Slynt knows her quite well.

长城一战他们一起躲在储藏室里
They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.

撒谎!
Lies!

女野人 婴儿
A wildling girl, a baby,

还有杰诺斯大人
and Lord Janos.

大战结束后我在那里找到了他
I found him there after the battle was over.

躲在他自己的尿液积成的水坑里
In a puddle of his own making.

当杰诺斯大人和女人孩子躲在一起时
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children

琼恩·雪诺在领导战斗
Jon Snow was leading.

没错 艾里沙爵士作战勇猛
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,

但他受伤后 是琼恩拯救了我们
but when he was wounded, it was Jon who saved us.

他指挥了长城的防御
He took charge of the Wall's defense,

他杀死了瑟恩人马格拿
he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,

还北上与曼斯·雷德谈判
he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.

明知自己很可能有去无回
Knowing it would almost certainly mean his own death.

在那之前
Before that,

他还领导了为莫尔蒙总司令复仇的行动
he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont.

莫尔蒙点名他为侍从
Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.

他看到了琼恩的闪光点
He saw something in Jon.

现在我们也都看到了
And now we've all seen it too.

他也许还年轻
He may be young,

但当最黑暗的长夜到来时
but he's the commander we turned to

他是我们可以信赖的指挥官
when the night was darkest.

对!
Yeah!

赞成
Aye.

同意
Can't argue with any of that.

但是琼恩·雪诺想领导谁?
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

守夜人?
The Night's Watch?

还是野人?
Or the wildlings?

大家都知道他爱过一个野人女孩
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl.

他和曼斯·雷德谈过很多次
He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

如果史坦尼斯的军队没有及时赶到
What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends

这两个老朋友在那个帐篷里会发生什么?
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

我们都看到他帮塞外之王在痛苦中解脱
We all saw him put the KingBeyondtheWall out of his misery.

你们想选一个终身与野人作战的人
Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life

还是一个向他们示爱的人?
or a man who makes love to them?

投票吧!
It is time!

你拿的什么?
What have you got there?

我说… . 转身走吧!
I said... Turn around and go!

转身… 
Turn around...

走! 原来是一把漂亮的小剑
and go! That's a nice little sword.

这把剑值一百只鸽子吧
Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.

对死人来说什么都不值
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

快! 走! 走啊!
Quickly, go! Go!

你是谁?
Who are you?

他们为什么害怕你?
Why were they scared of you?

你丢了这个
You lost this.

贾昆·赫加尔
布拉佛斯的无面者

你说这里没有贾昆·赫加尔
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

的确没有
There isn't.

某人不是贾昆·赫加尔
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

那你是谁?
Who are you then?

无名之辈
No one.

女孩也必须成为无名之辈
And that is who a girl must become.



她不属于这里

无论你们多少叛徒叫她“弥莎”

她永远不会成为你们的母亲

杀死伟主

为什么?
Why?

为了您 弥莎

您想让鹰身女妖死

但您的手被束缚住了

我让您自由了 正如您让我们所有人自由

他是我们的囚犯 即将接受审判

你无权这么做

他宁愿看到您的城市四分五裂 也不愿将奴隶从水深火热中拯救出来

现在已经没有奴隶了

也没有伟主了

那么住在金字塔里的人是谁?

是谁戴着金面具谋杀了您孩子们?

灰虫子来找我们的时候

我是第一个为您拿起武器的人

当我打倒我父亲的伟主时 我记得父亲的表情

那伟主夺走他襁褓中的儿子 只为了换一条狗

他在战斗中死了

如果我们任凭鹰身女妖之子重新给我们套上枷锁

我父亲就白白牺牲了

你无权夺取鹰身女妖的性命

过去 伟主是法律

而现在您就是法律

法律就是法律

拿下

弥莎!
Mhysa!

弥莎!
Mhysa!

弥莎!
Mhysa!

弥莎! 弥莎!
Mhysa! Mhysa!

她应该在大金字塔里砍下叛徒的头 一劳永逸
She should have cut the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.

我一直劝她这么处置你
That's what I keep telling her to do to you.

弥莎!
Mhysa!

你们向我敞开了大门

是因为我向你们承诺了自由和公正

这两者互相依存 缺一不可

兄弟! 兄弟!

弥莎 求您了!

宽恕我吧

一位弥林公民即将受审 而这个人谋杀了他

惩罚是死刑

宽恕! 宽恕!

弥莎!
Mhysa!

弥莎!
Mhysa!

陛下 今晚我会在您的门外站岗
l'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.

我们都在
We all guard tonight.

退下
Leave me.
