第八季第二集 
七王国的骑士 A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者”

在我小时候 我的哥哥会给我讲睡前故事
When I was a child,my brother would tell me a bedtime story...

故事是关于一个杀害了我们父王的人
about the man who murdered our father.

他从背后刺中父王 割破他的喉咙
Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat.

他坐在铁王座上 眼睁睁看着
Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生”“龙之母”

父王的鲜血在地上流淌
as his blood poured onto the floor.

哥哥还给我讲过其他故事
He told me other stories as well.

说到我们夺回七大王国之后
About all the things we would do to that man...

这个人落入我们手中时
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms

处置他的种种方式
and had him in our grasp.

你姐姐承诺过派兵来北方
Your sister pledged to send her army north.

她是说过
She did.

我可没看见什么军队
I don't see an army.

我只看到一个人 还只有一只手
I see one man, with one hand.

看来你姐姐骗了我
It appears your sister lied to me.

她也骗了我
She lied to me as well.

她从未想过派兵北上
She never had any intention of sending her army north.

她有了攸伦・葛雷乔伊的舰队和两万名精兵
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops.

提利昂・兰尼斯特 
“小恶魔” 女王之手

她花钱雇佣来的
The Golden Company from Essos,

厄斯索斯的黄金团
bought and paid for.

即使我们击败了尸鬼大军
Even if we defeat the dead,

她仍有足够的兵力击溃幸存的人
she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.

“我们”？
"We"?

我发誓要为生者战斗
I promised to fight for the living.

我希望能恪守誓言
I intend to keep that promise.

陛下 我是了解我哥哥的 就像了解你姐姐那样深？
Your Grace,I know my brother... Like you knew your sister?

他独自北上 很清楚自己会受到怎样的对待
He came here alone,knowing full well how he'd be received.

如果他刚才说的不是实情 那他还何必如此？
Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?

大概是相信在他割破我的喉咙前
Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him,

弟弟会一直为自己辩护吧
right up to the moment he slits my throat.

您是对的 我们不能轻信他
You're right.We can't trust him.

珊莎・史塔克 
临冬城公爵夫人

他曾当街袭击我的父亲
He attacked my father in the streets.

他想让我们家破人亡
He tried to destroy my house and my family,

所做之恶不比对您家族的少
the same as he did yours.

你想让我道歉么？
Do you want me to apologize?

别想了
I won't.

当时我们在交战
We were at war.

我的所作所为 都是为了我的家族 我的家人
Everything I did, I did for my house and my family.

再来一遍我还是一样
I'd do it all again.

布兰・史塔克
绿先知

想想我们为爱都做了什么
The things we do for love.

那为什么你现在抛弃了你的家族和家人呢？
So why have you abandoned your house and family now?

塔斯的布蕾妮
“美人”

因为现在已经不是忠于谁的问题了
Because this goes beyond loyalty.

现在关乎的是生死
This is about survival.

陛下 您不怎么了解我
You don't know me well, Your Grace.

但我了解詹姆爵士
But I know Ser Jaime.

他是个有荣誉感的人
He is a man of honor.

我曾俘虏过他
I was his captor once.

但是后来我们遭到绑架
But when we were both taken prisoner

当那帮人企图强奸我的时候
and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me,

詹姆爵士保护了我
Ser Jaime defended me.

还因此失去一只手
And lost his hand because of it.

夫人 没有他您可能就活不成了
Without him, my lady, you would not be alive.

他给了我武器和盔甲
He armed me, armored me,

派我去追踪您的下落 带您回家
and sent me to find you and bring you home

因为他向您母亲发过誓
because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.

你在为他做担保？
You vouch for him?

是的
I do.

你会和他并肩作战么？
You would fight beside him?

会的
I would.

我将性命托付于你
I trust you with my life.

若你也敢托付给他
If you trust him with yours,

那我们应当接纳他
we should let him stay.

北境守护意下如何？
What does the Warden of the North say about it?

琼恩・雪诺
伊耿・坦格利安

我们需要尽可能地招揽人手
We need every man we can get.

那好吧
Very well.

灰虫子
无垢者的指挥官

谢谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

你是不是知道瑟曦在撒谎 还帮她圆谎
Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise,

还是说你压根就不知道我们被骗了
or you didn't know at all.

反正你要么是个叛徒 要么是个傻子
Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.

我是傻子 也不是第一回了
I was a fool. Not for the first time.

瑟曦还坐在那王座上
Cersei still sits on the throne.

如果你不能帮我夺回来
If you can't help me take it back,

首相我就另找高明
I'll find another Hand who can.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
女王铁卫 “大熊”

我估计战事结束前 这首相徽章的主人
I suspect one of you will be wearing this

就要从你俩当中选了
before it's all over.

煤运到啦
Coal’s coming through.

詹德利
劳勃国王的私生子 “大牛”

艾莉亚・史塔克

你就没别的事可干了么？
Don't you have something better to do?

我的武器你做好没？
You make my weapon yet?

等我弄完手头几千把这玩意儿就动手
Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.

你应该先给我造
You should make mine first.

还要确保比这个再结实点
And make sure it's stronger than this.

够结实了吧
It's strong enough.

你知道吧 下到墓窖里会更安全的
It's going to be safer down in the crypt,you know.

你要去墓窖么？
Are you going to be down in the crypt?

不去 但 但你是个战士
No, but... But you're a fighter.

我打的尸鬼够多了
I've done my share.

你和尸鬼战斗过？
You've fought them?

指第七季第六集的剧情

嗯 打过一些吧
I did. Some of them.

有多少？
How many?

没多少
A few.

对我而言也挺多了
That was enough.

它们什么样啊？
What are they like?

可怕
Bad.

非常可怕
Really bad.

“非常可怕”？
"Really bad"?

连铁匠学徒都可以应付“非常可怕”的怪物呢
Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad."

它们到底长什么样？身上什么味道？
What do they look like? What do they smell like?

怎么行动？彻底弄死它们有多难？
How do they move? How hard are they to kill?

你听好 我知道你想战斗
Look, I know you want to fight.

知道你不怕什么强奸犯 杀人狂… 
And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or...

但这次不一样 这次…
This is different. This is...

这次是死亡
This is death.

你不是想知道它们什么样么？就是死亡的样子
You want to know what they're like? Death.

死亡 死神 反正就是那副模样
That's what they're like.

我见识过死神
I know Death.

他有千张面孔
He's got many faces.

很期待见见他这一张脸呢
I look forward to seeing this one.

我的武器呢？这就动手
My weapon? I'll get right on it.

我很抱歉把你推下塔楼
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

你当初并无歉意
You weren't sorry then.

你在维护自己的家人
You were protecting your family.

我已经不是那样的人了
I'm not that person anymore.

如果不是你当初把我推下去
You still would be,

你现在依旧是那样的人
if you hadn't pushed me out of that window.

而我可能还是布兰登・史塔克
And I would still be Brandon Stark.

你现在不是么？不是了
You're not? No.

我现在是另一种存在
I'm something else now.

你不怪我
You're not angry at me.

我不怪任何人
I'm not angry at anyone.

你为什么没有告诉他们 是我推的你？
Why didn't you tell them?

如果我让他们先杀了你
You won't be able to help us in this fight

你就不能在这场大战中助我们一臂之力了
if I let them murder you first.

那大战之后呢？
What about afterwards?

你怎么知道我们能活到大战之后？
How do you know there is an afterwards?

下一个
Next up.

在地上做个记号！
Put a marker in the ground!

把它送到城墙上去
Bring it up to the wall!

好的 送到城墙上去
Up to the wall. All right.

好的 好的
All right. All right.

得 我们都到这儿来了
Well, here we are.

是呀 我们都到这儿来了
Yes, here we are.

又在一起了
Together again.

而且民众喜闻乐见
And the masses rejoice.

他们怎么看待他们的新女王？
How do they feel about their new queen?

她也是你的新女王
She's your new queen too.

他们记得上次坦格利安家族
They remember what happened

带着龙北上时 发生过什么
the last time Targaryens brought dragons north.

一旦他们发现丹妮莉丝与她的祖先不一样
They'll come around

他们会回心转意的
once they see Daenerys is different.

那她真的是吗？不一样？
And she is? Different?

她不一样
She is.

你这么相信她？是的
You're sure about her? I am.

她似乎没有那么相信你
She didn't seem sure about you.

这不怪她
It's hard to blame her.

我犯了一个在聪明人看来愚不可及的错误
I made a mistake common to clever people.

我低估了我的敌人 嗯
I underestimated my opponents. Hmm.

瑟曦告诉我这次怀孕改变了她
Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her.

她说这是一个让你们俩都重新开始的契机
A chance for you both to start again.

而我相信了她
And I believed her.

那个东西可以移到角落去
That stuff can go on the end.

怀孕这事也是她捏造的吗？
Was she lying about the baby too?

不 那个倒是真的
No, that part is real.

她一直很擅长利用事实来编造谎话
She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies.

我不会苛责你
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

她把我骗得最苦
She's fooled me more than anybody.

不 他就在那儿
No, he's right there.

怎么了？
What?

她从来没有欺骗过你
She never fooled you.

你一直都很清楚她是怎样的人
You always knew exactly what she was,

但你依然爱她
and you loved her anyway.

看来… 
So...

… 我们会死在临冬城
...we're going to die at Winterfell.

这不是我原本计划的死法
Not the death I would've chosen.

我一直想象我80岁的时候
I always pictured myself

躺在自己床上
dying in my own bed,

行将就木
the age of 80,

喝饱了酒 还有… 一个姑娘
with a belly full of wine and  ...a girl's mouth

帮你吹箫 帮我吹箫
around your cock. around my cock.

至少瑟曦无法亲手杀死我
At least Cersei won't get to murder me.

当我正被尸鬼撕碎的时候
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction

想到剥夺了她这一乐趣
denying her that pleasure

肯定会感到某种满足
while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

或许等我死了以后… 
Maybe after I'm dead...

我会南下进军君临城
I'll march down to King's Landing

然后撕碎瑟曦
and rip her apart.

你们会看到尸鬼大军
You will see the Army of the Dead.

很好
Good.

波德瑞克・派恩
布蕾妮的侍从

很好 对 瞄准
Good. Yes, aim.

别急
Don't rush.

上前来
Come forward

来呀
Come on.

詹姆爵士
 Ser Jaime.

布蕾妮小姐
Lady Brienne.

他进步很大  凑合吧
He's come a long way. He's all right.

再来一次 快点
One more time. Come on.

需要学习的还很多 你肯定会教他的
Still has a lot to learn. I'm sure you'll teach him.

这次好多了
Better, better.

我听说你将指挥左翼部队
I've been told you're commanding the left flank.

是的
I am.

这个 呃… 地形不错
It's, uh... It's good ground.

是的
It is.

那个斜坡 会对我们有利
The rise, it should give us some advantage.

如果我们能保持紧密的队形
If we can keep a tight formation,

我们或许有机会击退他们
we might be able to beat them back.

是 你说的对
Yes, I think you're right.

你怎么回事？ 什么？
What are you doing? What?

我想你应该知道 我真的不知道
I think you know. I truly don't.

我们从来没有哪次交谈 这么半天了你都没侮辱我
We have never had a conversation last this long

一次也没有
without you insulting me. Not once.

你希望我侮辱你？
You want me to insult you?

不！ 很好
No! Good.

我到临冬城是因为… 
I came to Winterfell because...

虽然我不是从前那样优秀的战士了
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

但如果能在你的指挥下战斗 我会倍感荣耀
But I'd be honored to serve under your command,

如果你愿意接纳我的话
if you'll have me.

我得回去了
I better get back.

抱歉 卡丽熙
Forgive me, khaleesi.

你做了什么冒犯我的事？
Have you done something to offend me?

很多
Many things.

很久就原谅了以前的事
Long ago and long forgiven.

但就算我犯下过失
But you did forgive,

你仍然原谅了我
despite my failures.

当我听说你任命了提利昂为御前首相
When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand,

我的心都碎了
it broke my heart.

我任命他为首相的时候
When I named him Hand,

并不知道我能否再见到你
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

你做出了正确的选择
You made the right choice.

在我的印象中 你不是很喜欢他
I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.

确实
I didn't.

我们从瓦兰提斯到弥林那一路上
His mouth hardly stopped moving

他一直喋喋不休
between Volantis and Meereen.

我强忍着才没将他丢进海里
It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.

但在那些油腔滑调背后 他的聪明才智… 
But the mind behind all those words...

他犯了错误
He's made mistakes.

很严重的错误
Serious mistakes.

我们都犯过错
As have we all.

他有自己的过失
He owns his

然后从中吸取教训
and learns from them.

你在建议我宽恕
You're advising me to forgive the man

那个抢占你位置的人？
who stole your position?

是的
I am.

如果您允许的话
And one other suggestion,

我还有一个谏言
if you'll allow me.

等到所有步兵都被调派到战场上
The moment we can get the last infantryman

我们就应该马上关闭城门
out onto the field, we should shut the gates.

尽你的全力让城门多开一会
Keep them open for as long as you can.

还有人正从郊外逃难而来
There are still people coming in from the countryside.

约恩・罗伊斯
“青铜” 谷地领主

珊莎夫人 我希望我们可以私下谈谈
Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.

我之前本以为
I thought you and I

就快和你达成共识了
were on the verge of agreement before.

关于詹姆爵士的问题
About Ser Jaime.

布蕾妮一直对我很忠诚
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.

她是我最信任的人
I trust her more than anyone.

我真希望我也能如此信任我的顾问
I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.

提利昂是个好人
Tyrion is a good man.

他对我一向彬彬有礼
He was never anything but decent towards me.

我任命他为首相 不仅仅是因为他是个好人
I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.

我任命他为我的首相
I asked him to be my Hand

是因为他是个有头脑的好人
because he was good, and intelligent,

而且必要时 他也会变得无情
and ruthless when he had to be.

他一开始就不应该相信瑟曦
He never should have trusted Cersei.

您也不应该相信她
You never should have either.

我以为他了解他的姐姐
I thought he knew his sister.

家家有本难念的经
Families are complicated.

我家也是如此
Ours certainly have been.

可悲的共同点
A sad thing to have in common.

我们两个还有其他的共同点
We have other things in common.

我们都知道作为女性领导者的艰难
We've both known what it means to lead people

领导那些不愿意屈服于女人的人
who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule.

而且在我来看
And we've both done a damn good job of it,

我们都做得很好
from what I can tell.

尽管如此 我还是感受到我们之间有些不睦
And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another.

为什么？
Why is that?

你哥哥
Your brother.

他爱您 您是知道的
He loves you, you know that.

但是这点困扰着你
That bothers you.

男人会为女人做蠢事
Men do stupid things for women.

他们很容易受女人摆布
They're easily manipulated.

我这一生只有一个目标
All my life, I've known one goal:

铁王座
the Iron Throne.

我要把它从毁掉我家族的敌人手里夺回来
Taking it back from the people

这个敌人也几乎毁掉你的家族
who destroyed my family,and almost destroyed yours.

我只与他们为敌
My war was against them.

直到我遇到了琼恩
Until I met Jon.

如今我在这里 在半个世界之外
Now I'm here, half a world away,

在琼恩的战争中与他并肩作战
fighting Jon's war alongside him.

你来告诉我 到底是谁受谁的摆布？
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

你当初一抵达临冬城时我就应该向您表示感谢
I should have thanked you the moment you arrived.

而我当时没有 这是我的错
That was a mistake.

我如今在这里 是因为我爱上了你哥哥… 
I'm here because I love your brother...

因为我相信他… 
and I trust him...

也因为我知道他是个恪守承诺的人
and I know he's true to his word.

他是我生命中仅有的第二个男人
He's only the second man in my life

我可以这么说
I can say that about.

谁是第一个男人？
Who was the first?

某个高点儿的人
Someone taller.

那么之后呢？
And what happens afterwards?

当我们消灭了尸鬼大军 打败了瑟曦
We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.

之后呢？
What happens then?

我夺回铁王座
I take the Iron Throne.

那么北境呢？
What about the North?

敌人从我们手中夺走北境
It was taken from us,

我们又亲手将它夺回
and we took it back.

我们也曾说过 北境永远不再向任何人俯首称臣
And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again.

到时候 您将如何处置北境？
What about the North?

抱歉打扰了  夫人 陛下… 
Apologies, my lady.Your Grace...

什么事？
What is it?

席恩・葛雷乔伊

女王陛下
My queen.

你姐姐呢？
Your sister?

她只剩下了几艘船
She only has a few ships,

也没法把船开来这里
and she couldn't sail them here.

所以她去了铁群岛
So she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead,

她将以您的名义夺回铁群岛
to take them back in your name.

你为什么没有和她一起回去？
But why aren't you with her?

我想为临冬城作战 珊莎公爵夫人… 
I want to fight for Winterfell,Lady Sansa...

如果您允许的话
if you'll have me.

大人 我们不是当兵的
Milord, we're not soldiers.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

你们现在都是了
You are now.

听着 我活了大半辈子
Look, I made it through most of my years

连战场的边儿都没蹭到
without ever getting near a fight,

但是我在私生子之战里活下来了
but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards.

就在那道城墙之外
Right outside these walls.

既然我能从那儿活下来 你们也能活下去
If I can live through that,you can live through this.

他们会在锻造处给你们武器和装备
They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge.

就在那边
Right that way.

谢谢您
Thank you.

当大战来临时 你们在墓窖里躲好
When the time comes,you'll be down in the crypts.

那里是最安全的地方
They're the safest place to be.

吉莉
山姆威尔的爱人

穿过那扇拱门就是了
Through that archway right over there.

谢谢你
Thank you.

喂 喂 下一个是谁 小伙子们？
Hey, hey, who's next, lads?

谢谢您 大人 回来！
Thank you, sir.Come back!

我应该往哪边去？
Which way should I go?

你想去哪边？
Which way do you want to go?

所有的孩子到时候
All the children will be going below

都会待在墓窖里
when the time comes.

但是我的两个哥哥曾经都是战士
But both me brothers were soldiers.

我也想上战场
I want to fight too.

很高兴听到你这么说
That's good to hear.

到时候我会和我的儿子一起待在墓窖里
I'm going to be in the crypt with my son,

如果能和你待在一起 有你保护我们
and I'd feel a lot better with you down there

我会感到更安全 很多人都会这样觉得
to protect us.I'm sure a lot of people would.

好呀 那我就去保护墓窖里的人
All right.I'll defend the crypt, then.

骑手归来！
Riders coming in!

山姆威尔・塔利

艾迪森・托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪” 守夜人指挥官

我亲爱的小乌鸦
My little crow.

托蒙德
“巨人克星”

我以为你死了
I thought we'd lost you.

差点
Almost.

贝里・唐德利恩
“闪电大王”

把它们拉到马厩里去
Put them in the stables.

你们怎么碰到一起的？
How did you find each other?

我们在最后壁炉城碰面
We met up at the Last Hearth.

但是尸鬼大军先我们一步
The dead got there first.

安柏家族的人呢？
The Umbers?

现在为夜王而战了
Fighting for the Night King now.

我们得绕过他们才回到这里
We had to travel around them to get here.

目前没在这儿的人
Whoever's not here now

都成了他们的一员
is with them.

我们还有多长时间？
How long do we have?

只到明早太阳升起之前
Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

大个子女人还在这儿吗？
The big woman still here?

他们就要来了
They're coming.

下一位
Next.

我们有龙晶
We have dragonglass

和瓦雷利亚钢
and Valyrian steel.

但它们的数量众多
But there are too many of them.

远远超过我们
Far too many.

我们的敌人不知疲倦
Our enemy doesn't tire.

不做停留
Doesn't stop.

没有感受
Doesn't feel.

与它们硬碰硬的话我们没有胜算
We can't beat them in a straight fight.

那我们该怎么做？
So, what can we do?

它们都是被夜王转化的 听他的指挥
The Night King made them all.They follow his command.

如果夜王倒下… 
If he falls...

干掉他应该是我们最好的机会
Getting to him may be our best chance.

如果这是真的 他绝对不会露面
If that's true,he'll never expose himself.

他会的
Yes, he will.

他会来找我的
He'll come for me.

他先前试过很多次  找到过很多三眼乌鸦
He's tried before, many times,with many ThreeEyed Ravens.

亚丽・卡史塔克
卡霍城伯爵夫人

为什么？
Why?

他究竟想要什么？
What does he want?

无尽的长夜
An endless night.

他想抹去这个世界 而我是这个世界的记忆
He wants to erase this world,and I am its memory.

那就是死亡的意义了 不是吗
That's what death is,isn't it?

忘记
Forgetting.

和被忘记
Being forgotten.

如果我们忘记了我们去过何地
If we forget where we've been

做过何事
and what we've done,

我们就不再是人了
we're not men anymore.

只是动物而已
Just animals.

你的记忆并不来自于书籍
Your memories don't come from books.

你的经历也不仅仅是简单的故事
Your stories aren't just stories.

如果我想抹除人类世界
If I wanted to erase the world of men,

我会先从你下手
I'd start with you.

夜王怎样能找到你？
How will he find you?

我身上有他的标记
His mark is on me.

他一直都知道我在哪
He always knows where I am.

我们会把你安置在墓窖中
We'll put you in the crypt,

那里是最安全的 不
where it's safest. No.

我们需要在他的军队彻底毁灭我们之前
We need to lure him into the open

把他引诱到开阔地带
before his army destroys us all.

我会在神木林等着他
I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

你想让我们把你当作诱饵？
You want us to use you as bait?

我们不会把你自己扔在那里
We're not leaving you alone out there.

他不是一个人 我会和他在一起
He won't be. I'll stay with him.

还有所有的铁种
With the Ironborn.

我曾经从你手中夺走了这座城堡
I took this castle from you.

现在就让我来守护你
Let me defend you now.

我们会尽可能拖住其余的亡者大军
We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.

时机到来之际
When the time comes,

我和戴佛斯爵士会在城墙上
Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,

给你们点燃战壕的信号
to give you the signal to light the trench.

戴佛斯爵士完全可以自己挥舞火把
Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.

你就待在地窖里
You'll be in the crypt.

陛下 我也曾参加过战斗
Your Grace, I have fought before,

我可以再打一仗
I can do it again.

与那些冒着生命危险的
Alongside the men and women

男人和女人们一同战斗
risking their lives.

他们有成千上万人
There are thousands of them

可你只有一个
and only one of you.

你不能像他们一样勇猛地战斗
You can't fight as well as they can,

但你思考起来比他们都厉害
but you can think better than any of them.

你在这里是因为你机智过人
You're here because of your mind.

如果我们幸存下来 我还需要你的智慧
If we survive, I'll need it.

在战场上 巨龙应该能给我们带来一些优势
The dragons should give us an edge in the field.

如果巨龙在战场上 它们就没法保护布兰
If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran.

我们得离布兰近一点
We need to be near him.

不能太近
Not too near,

否则夜王就不会来了

just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.

你去哪儿
