“塞外之王”

你又披上了黑袍
You're wearing a black cloak again.

他们派我前来与你谈判
I've been sent to negotiate with you.

似乎我轻信的天性又一次占了上风
It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.

这也不是第一次了
It's happened before.

琼恩・雪诺 我多希望当时你向我们宣誓时是忠诚的
I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

真的 非常希望
Truly I was.

断掌科林命我加入你的军队
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army

然后把收集到的一切信息带回黑城堡
and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.

他让我杀了他以便获得你们的信任
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

我的确忠于他… 
I was loyal...

我忠于科林与守夜人的誓言
to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

所有誓言吗？ 
 All your vows?

她还不足以改变你 对吗？
She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

那你足以改变她吗？
Were you enough to turn her?

我离开时 她向我
She put three arrows in me

射了三箭
when I escaped.

你在黑城堡与她重逢了吗？
Did you see her again at Castle Black?

是的 然后呢？
Yes. And?

她死了
She's dead.

是你干的？ 不
Your doing? No.

我们应当敬她一杯
We'll drink to her.

我有千万种方法可以杀了你
Of all the ways I'd kill you,

还不至于要下毒
poison would be the last.

敬耶哥蕊特 敬耶哥蕊特
Ygritte. Ygritte.

这不是葡萄酒
That's not wine.

不 这是北境人喝的酒 琼恩・雪诺
No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

你们干的很好 战斗得很顽强
You did well. Fought hard.

有几个我们最强壮的战士也被你们杀了
Killed some of our strongest men.

我们的一位巨人进入了你们的地道
One of our giants went into your tunnel

再也没出来
and never came out again.

强壮的玛格
Mag the Mighty.

他死了
He's dead.

他杀了我的朋友葛兰
He killed my friend Grenn.

他是巨人国王
He was their king.

他的血脉可以追溯到先民到达之前
The last of a bloodline that stretches back

他是硕果仅存的一位
before the First Men.

葛兰来自一个小农庄
Grenn came from a farm.

敬玛格与葛兰 敬葛兰与玛格
Mag and Grenn. Grenn and Mag.

科柏克 能拿点吃的来吗？
Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?

我觉得我的客人可能有相当一段时间
I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything

没吃东西了吧
for quite some time.

所以 你是来和我谈条件的？
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

撤走军队 回家去吧
Turn your army around and go home.

你知道我很清楚你们的弓箭不多了
You know I know you're low on arrows,

燃油不多了 人也不多了
you're low on oil, you're low on men.

你们还剩多少人？有五十个吗？
How many are left, 50?

我告诉托蒙德和欧瑞尔了
I told Tormund and Orell.

我们有一千多名战士
We have more than 1,000 men.

我把一切毫无保留的展示给你
I showed you everything I had.

我们十万人的大军
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

然而你做了什么？你利用所知道的一切攻击我们
And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had.

可这并不算什么 我发现你背叛后
It wasn't much. As soon as I saw that,

立即调派了四百名勇士攀登城墙
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

从这儿向西五英里 有一段无人看守的区域
an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

他们中许多人会死在攀登途中
A lot of them will die climbing,

然而今夜之后大部分勇士就将到达长城背后
but most of them will be over by the end of the day.

琼恩・雪诺 我对你十分诚实
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow,

你对我可从来不这么坦诚
which is more than you've ever done for me.

我的人民已流得够多血了
My people have bled enough.

我们并不是来征服一切的
We're not here to conquer.

我们只希望躲到你们的长城后面
We're here to hide behind your Wall.

和你们一样 我们需要你们的地道
Just like you. We need your tunnel.

我们都知道凛冬将至
Now we both know that winter is coming.

如果我的人民不能在严冬到达之前迁入长城南面
And if my people aren't south of the Wall when it comes in earnest,

我们的下场比死还不如
we'll all end up worse than dead.

你希望和我们谈条件？
You want to strike a bargain with me?

我的条件很简单
Here's the bargain.

你回去 打开城门
You go back, you open the gates to us,

我向你保证再不会有人死去
and I swear to you that no one else will die.

如果你拒绝
Refuse,

我们将屠尽黑城堡里所有的人
and we'll kill every last man at Castle Black.

啊！
Ah!

哦 这才是你的本意
Oh, that's why you're here.

我承认如果你动手的话他们来不及阻止你
I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.

当然 之后他们就会杀了你
They'd kill you, of course.

他们会慢慢虐杀你
They'd kill you slow.

不过你走进帐篷的时候就知道这一点了
But you knew that when you came in here.

你觉得你能下得了手吗 琼恩・雪诺？
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

在帐篷主人主动议和时刺杀他？
Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered you peace?

守夜人就这点能耐？
Is that what the Night's Watch is?

你就这点能耐？
Is that what you are?

有骑士冲过来了！
Riders coming!

你想趁和谈时突袭我们吗？ 不
Are you attacking us? No.

正如你所说 我们没有兵力突袭
It's like you said, we don't have the men.

守住！ 集合！ 集合！
Hold! To me! To me!

放下武器！
Stand down!

我说过我的人民已流够血了
I said my people have bled enough

这绝非虚言
and I meant it.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
狭海中的王

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

把他们赶到一起
Round them up.

别下马
Stay with the horses.

你就是塞外之王？
You're the KingbeyondtheWall?

你知道我是谁吗？ 未闻阁下大名
Do you know who I am? Never had the pleasure.

这是史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
This is Stannis Baratheon,

七大王国唯一正统的国王
the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

我们并不在七大王国的疆界内 你的衣着可不适合这儿的天气
We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.

向国王投降时下跪是基本礼仪
It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

自由民从不屈膝
We do not kneel.

夜幕降临前我手下会有上千名你的子民
I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall,

我们没有住宿安置他们 也没有食物喂养他们
have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.

我并不想屠杀无用的落水狗
I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.

他们的命运由他们的国王决定
Their fate depends on their king.

悉听尊便 我们绝不屈膝
All the same, we do not kneel.

把他们带走
Take these men away.

一个守夜人跑到野人的帐篷里来干什么？
What's a man of the Night's Watch doing in a wildling camp?

他们派我前来与塞外之王谈判
I was sent to discuss terms with the KingbeyondtheWall.

年轻人 你正与王国唯一的正统国王交谈
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

你需要尊称他为陛下
You will address him as Your Grace.

我知道他是正统国王 我父亲为他而死
I know he's the king. My father died for him.

陛下 我的名字是琼恩雪诺
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

我是奈德・史塔克的儿子
I'm Ned Stark's son.

你父亲是一位值得尊敬的人
Your father was an honorable man.

正如你所言 陛下
He was, Your Grace.

你认为他会如何处置野人头目呢？
What do you think he'd have done with him?

我曾是他的阶下囚
I was this man's prisoner once.

他本可虐待我或杀死我
He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.

可他饶了我一命
But he spared my life.

我认为我父亲会将他囚禁起来
I think my father would have taken him prisoner,

听听他会怎么说
listened to what he had to say.

好吧 那么把他关起来
Very well, then. Take him.

陛下
Your Grace.

如果我父亲看到了我所经历的事情
If my father had seen the things that I've seen,

他一定会建议您在夜幕降临之前焚毁尸体
he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.

所有尸体
All of them.

科本
被剥夺项链的学士

我会建议用点罂粟花奶 减轻他的痛苦
I would suggest milk of the poppy

可他已经彻底麻木了
to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
太后

可恶的马泰尔家族
Bloody Martells.

这似乎是狮身蝎尾兽毒
The cause appears to be manticore venom.

格雷果・克里冈
“魔山”

嗯 是的 死神之首 狮身蝎尾兽
It is. The Death's Head manticore.

派席尔
大学士

我曾阅读过许多相关书籍
Yes, I've read a great deal about it.

这是种非常恐怖的毒液
It's a horrible poison.

往往来自于曼达利
Usually Mantari in origin.

哦！是啊是啊
Oh! Yes, yes.

已经回天乏术了
There's nothing to be done.

不 也许还有救
Yes, there is.

我能请问一下阁下这是在做什么吗？
May I ask what you think you're doing?

拯救他
Saving him.

陛下 我很希望我们能有其他选择
Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise,

不过格雷果爵士已经无药可救了
but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

远非人力能及
Well, well beyond.

这家伙连学士都不是
This man is not even a maester,

竟在这里充起大学士来了
let alone Grand Maester.

幸好如此
That's for the best.

学士们才不知道如何拯救他呢
No maester knows how to save him.

正是因为他如此傲慢
That is exactly the sort of arrogance

学城才决定开除他的 陛下
that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.

他所谓的好奇心违背自然 异常危险
His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.

我认为开除他真是明智的决定
Rightly so, in my opinion.

大学士 你可以离开了
You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

陛下 这可是我的实验室
But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

现在不是了 可我… 
Not anymore.  But I

你能救他吗？ 很难说 陛下
You can save him? Difficult to say, Your Grace.

但如果我过去的成果能派得上用场… 
But if my past work is any guide...

… 我们也许有希望
...we stand a chance.

尽你一切力量救他
Do everything you can.

需要什么都请告诉我
Come to me for anything you need.

谢谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

不过您得知道
You should know,

这一过程或许会让他… 
the process may change him...

有点变化。
somewhat.

会使他变弱吗？
Will it weaken him?

哦绝不会
Oh, no.

那就够了
Very well, then.

够了
Not another word.

我们已经讨论过这个 事情已经敲定了
We've been over this. The matter's closed.

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

可我想再谈一谈
I'm opening it again.

你已经与洛拉斯・提利尔订婚
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

眼下便是他的未婚妻
You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

等到托曼和玛格丽成婚时
And you will marry Loras Tyrell

便是洛拉斯・提利尔迎娶你之日
as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

我不会嫁给他
I will not.

詹姆不能结婚 也不能继承领土
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

提利昂的判决明天就要执行
Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow.

你曾经多次声称
You have on several occasions made great claims

愿为家族做出一切
about your commitment to this family's future.

而现在 你对这个家族
Your role in that future

比以往任何时候都重要
is more vital now than it ever was.

我不在乎
I don't care.

君临才是我的归宿，我要跟我儿子一起留在这里，他才是国王
I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son the king.

在你九岁那年 我被命令前往首都
When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital.

当时我决定带上你的弟弟 而不是你
I decided to take your brother with me and not you.

你却坚持无论在什么情况下
You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock

自己都不能被留在凯岩城 如果你还记得… 
under any circumstances. And if you recall

我没有兴趣听你在这里洋洋自得
I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories

复述你上次是怎么赢得争论的
about the time you won.

这次我不会再听你的摆布
This isn't going to be one of those times.

你以为你会是第一个
Do you think you'll be the first person

被强行拖到教堂成婚的人么？
dragged into a sept to be married against her will?

你那时大步踏入王座厅
When you marched into the throne room to tell me

告诉我我们赢得了黑水河之战… 你还记得么？
we'd won the Battle of Blackwaterdo you remember?

当时我和托曼坐在铁王座上
I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

我已经准备好喂他服下夜影之水
I was about to give him essence of nightshade.

一想到那些恶棍会把我的儿子夺走
That's how far I was willing to go when I thought

我什么都做得出来
someone awful had come to take my son away.

而现在 又有些恶棍要来把他夺走
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

不 乔佛里死了
No. Joffrey is dead.

弥赛像家畜一样被卖了出去
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

而你现在想把我送到高庭去 偷走我的孩子
And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.

我最后的孩子
My last boy.

玛格丽会把爪子伸出来
Margaery will dig her claws in,

你也会把爪子伸出来 你们会像野兽一样
you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him

争夺他 直到把他撕成两半
like beasts until you rip him apart.

在此之前 我宁可先毁了我们的家族
I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.

你想做什么？
And how will you do that?

我要将真相公之于众
I'll tell everyone the truth.

什么真相？
What truth would that be?

你不知道 是么？
You don't know, do you?

你从来不肯相信
You never believed it.

这怎么可能呢？
How is that possible?

我在说什么呢？这当然有可能
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

一个如此着魔于自己理想中家族理念的人
How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family

又怎么会对家族里真正发生的事情有一点概念呢？
have any conception what his actual family was doing?

我们当初就在你眼皮子底下 而你却视而不见
We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us.

过去二十年里如果你看过一眼
One look in the past 20 years,

认真看一眼你自己的孩子们 你就该知道
one real look at your own children and you would have known.

知道什么？
Known what?

他们说的都是真的
Everything they say is true.

詹姆和我的事 不
About Jaime and me. No.

你所谓的千秋家业就是个笑话  不 不 不 不
Your legacy is a lie. No, no, no, no.

我不相信你的话
I don't believe you.

不 你相信
Yes, you do.

詹姆
Jaime.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者” 御林铁卫队长

你赢了
You won.

又少了一个弟弟 你一定很自豪吧
One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.

没有什么事情你做不出来的 是吧？
There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?

为了我的家族 没有
For my family, no, nothing.

你无法想象我能为了家族做出什么事
I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.

提利昂是你的家人 他不是
Tyrion is your family. He's not.

这件事你无法选择 我可以 你也一样
You don't get to choose. I do. So do you.

你可以选择那个降生时害死我们母亲的东西… 
You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world

你真的疯到认为他要为此负责？
Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?

他没有想要害死她 他只是个婴儿
He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

疾病也没有想要杀死任何人
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

可你还是会在这之前把它除去
All the same, you cut it out before it does.

你想要的是什么？你选择什么？
What do you decide? What do you choose?

我为了回到你身边做的那些事
The things I did to get back to you,

为了找回你而承受的痛苦… 
to endure all that, only to find you

我选择你
I choose you.

你不过是说说 不
Those are words. Yes.

就像我刚跟父亲说的一样
Like the ones I just said to Father.

我告诉他了
I told him.

告诉他什么？
Told him what?

关于我们的事
I told him about us.

你告诉他了？
You told him?

我告诉他我不会嫁给洛拉斯?提利尔
I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

我告诉他我要呆在这里 跟托曼在一起 和你在一起
I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.

你认为他会就这么接受这个决定？
You think he'll just accept that?

去问他吧
Go and ask him.

你说了什么？
What did you say?

我不想再谈论泰温・兰尼斯特
I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

我没有选择泰温・兰尼斯特
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

我不爱泰温・兰尼斯特
I don't love Tywin Lannister.

我爱我的弟弟
I love my brother.

我爱我的爱人
I love my lover.

别人会说闲话 会嘲笑我们
People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.

随他们去
Let them.

他们都那么渺小 我甚至看不到他们
They're all so small, I can't even see them.

我只看到最重要的
I only see what matters.

也许有人会进来
Someone will walk in.

我不管
I don't care.

你正站在“风暴降生”丹妮莉丝

不焚者

弥林女王

安达尔人 洛伊拿人和先民的女王

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母

大草原的“卡丽熙”

镣铐破除者和龙之母的面前

感谢您召见我 女王陛下

我的名字是费内兹

如果您需要的话 我也可以说通用语
I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
“无畏的” 女王铁卫

你说得非常好
You speak it very well.

在您给我自由前 我属于米格达尔伟主
Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.

我是他孩子们的导师
I was tutor to his children.

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

我教导他们语言和历史
I taught them languages and history.

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

因为我 他们对您的家族非常了解
They know a great deal about your family because of me.

小卡拉只有七岁
Little Calla is only seven,

但她非常仰慕您
but she admires you very much.

我希望我能配得上她的仰慕
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

我能为你做什么？
What can I do for you?

您占领城市时 孩子们乞求我
When you took the city, the children begged me

不要离开他们的家
not to leave the house.

可米格达尔伟主和我都认为我必须离开
But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

所以我无家可归
So I lost my home.

现在只能睡在街上
Now I live on the streets.

我安排了食堂和棚屋
I have outfitted mess halls

给曾经的奴隶提供伙食和住宿
to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

我无意冒犯 女王陛下
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

我去过那些地方
I went to one of these places.

年轻人欺压老者
The young prey on the old.

随意抢夺想要的东西 还殴打反抗者
Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

我的无垢者会尽快恢复秩序保证安全
My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order,

朋友 我向你保证
my friend, this I promise you.

即使那些地方安全了 我在那儿算什么？
Even if they are safe, who would I be there?

我生活的目标是什么？
What purpose would I serve?

在我的主人家里 我是一个老师
With my master, I was a teacher.

他的孩子们尊敬我 爱戴我
I had the respect and love of his children.

你到底想要什么？
What is it that you want from me?

女王陛下 我请求您
Your Grace, I ask you

让我把自己卖回给米格达尔伟主
to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

你想回到拥有你的人那里
You want to return to a man who owned you

像他拥有的一只山羊 一把椅子一样？
like a goat or a chair?

我向您请求 女王陛下
Please, Your Grace.

年轻人也许会在您为他们建立的新世界里欣喜若狂
The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them,

但我们这些经受不住变化的老家伙
but for those of us too old to change,

却只能在这个世界里恐惧而凄惨地活着
there is only fear and squalor.

这样想的不止我一个
I am not alone.

外面还有很多人等着向您请求同样的事情
There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.

我解放了这里的人民
I did not take this city to preside

并不是为了给他们套上同样的枷锁
over the injustice I fought to destroy.

我占领这里是为了给人民带来自由
I took it to bring people freedom.

但自由意味着由你自己做决定
But freedom means making your own choices.

我允许你与你之前的主人签订合同
I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.

但合同的期限不能超过一年
It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.

谢谢 女王陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

谢谢
Thank you.

伟主们会利用这一点钻空子
The masters will take advantage of this situation.

那些为他们服务的人
The men serving them

实际上还是奴隶
will be slaves in all but name.

靠近些 朋友
Approach, my friend.

我听不懂 女王陛下

我听不懂 女王陛下

女王陛下说你可以靠近点

我带来了… 
I have brought you

他从天上飞来
He came from the sky.

The black one.

有翼的黑影
The winged shadow.

他从天上飞来 然后… 
He came from the sky and...

我的女儿
My girl.

我的小女儿
My little girl.

她叫什么名字？
What was her name?

她叫扎拉 陛下
Zala, Your Grace.

她几岁？ 三岁
How old was she? Three.

三岁
Three.

还没有卓耿的消息吗？

有船员三天前看到它在黑色大峭壁附近飞翔 女王陛下

在这之后就没有消息了

去地底墓室见我

韦赛利昂
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的龙

雷哥
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的龙

他们中有的来自白港和荒冢屯
They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton,
