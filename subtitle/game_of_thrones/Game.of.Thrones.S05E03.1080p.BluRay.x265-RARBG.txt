凡人皆有一死 凡人皆需侍奉
Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.

我扫了好几天的地了
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

很好 我不是来这扫地的
Good. I didn't come here to sweep floors.

不是？那你为何而来？
No? Why come then?

你说过要收我为徒
You said that I could be your apprentice.

你说要教我当一个无面者
You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.

某人教女孩
A man teaches a girl.

凡人皆需侍奉 凡人皆需侍奉
Valar dohaeris. All men must serve.

无面者尤甚
Faceless men, most of all.

我想侍奉
I want to serve.

女孩想侍奉的是自己
A girl wants to serve herself.

而我们侍奉的是千面之神 若要侍奉得当
Here we serve the ManyFaced God, to serve well.

女孩必须成为无名之辈 哪个是千面之神？
A girl must become noone. Which one is the ManyFaced God?

我见到了陌客 见到了淹神
I see the Stranger, I see the Drowned God,

还见到了鱼梁木的脸 这里只有一个神
I see the Weirwood Face. There is only one god.

女孩知道他的名字
A girl knows his name.

但无人知晓他的恩赐
And no man know his gift.

他们要带他去哪？
Where are they taking him?

玛格丽王后万岁！
Queen Margaery!

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
太后

玛格丽王后万岁！
Queen Margaery!

玛格丽王后万岁！
Queen Margaery!

我属于他 他属于我 我属于她 她属于我
I'm his, and he's mine. I'm hers, and she's mine.

从今开始 至死方休 从今开始 至死方休
From this day until the end of my days. From this day until the end of my days.

玛格丽・提利尔
托曼・拜拉席恩的王后

托曼・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

我没弄疼你吧？ 没 你真棒
Did I hurt you? No. You were lovely.

一切发生都得好快 是啊
It all happened so fast. Yes.

我怕弄疼你了 因为听起来… 
I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded like...

没有 没有 没有
No, no, no...

你真可爱
you're very sweet.

简直是世上最可爱的国王了
The sweetest king who ever lived.

要是一直能这样就好了 我愿把余生都用来做这个
This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.

那该多有意思？
Wouldn't that be glorious?

不如先歇会？
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

喘口气 不用急 对吧
Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?

当然不急
Of course not.

你饿不饿？
Are you hungry?

要不要叫人拿点蛋糕或石榴汁？
Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice...?

不 我不饿
No, I'm fine...

有你就够了
I just want you all to myself.

我想更了解你 想知道一切有关托曼一世国王的事情
I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.

托曼国王… 听起来还是不习惯
King Tommen... it still sounds strange to me.

你习惯别人叫你玛格丽王后么？
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

不习惯 夫君 夫人
So strange. Husband. Wife.

有时候感觉怪怪的
Sometimes it feels odd.

我成了国王 娶了世上最美的姑娘
I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world,

而这都是因为我哥哥死了
and it's all because my brother died.

我理解
I understand.

但你知道 这不是你的错 对吧
But it's no your fault, you know that, don't you?

你不需要内疚
You mustn't feel guilty.

我不觉得内疚 这就是我说的奇怪的地方
I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.

你喜欢航海么？
Do you like to sail?

我爱死了 我也是
I love to sail. I do, too.

我觉得以后的日子会很幸福 你和我的日子
I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.

我也这么想
I do, too.

住在高高的塔楼里 直入云霄
Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds.

当然我奶奶已经急着想回家了
Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home.

因为君临可不是谁都能呆的
The capital is not for everyone, I suppose.

你母亲喜欢这里么？
Does your mother like it here?

我觉得她不喜欢
I don't think so.

她让我不要相信君临的任何人
She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

有她照顾你真好
It's so wonderful to have her watching over you.

母狮领着小狮
A lioness guiding her cub.

但我是个大人了 现在是了
Well, but I'm a man now.

当然
You are.

还当上了国王
And the king.

但你永远是她的小宝宝
But you'll always be her babyboy.

大概吧
I suppose.

我仰慕她 对我总那么慷慨 那么善良
I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind.

而她经历了那么多可怕的事情
And the horror she's had to injure.

失去了丈夫 长子和父亲
Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father.

难怪总是把你护得紧紧的
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

绝不让你离开她的视线
She'll never let you out of her sight.

你陷入热恋中了
You're very much in love.

新婚燕尔总是很幸福的
The first days of marriage are often so blissful.

她很漂亮 对吧
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

爱笑 像个玩具娃娃
Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot.

她觉得自己很聪明吧？这我可说不准
she thinks she's intelligent? I can't quite tell.

但这不重要 你想念凯岩城么？
Not that it matters. Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

凯岩城没有什么值得我留恋的
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

那可是你长大的地方啊
That's where you grew up.

你以前总是说更喜欢那里的人
You always told me that you liked the people there better.

你说君临像马粪和馊奶一样臭
You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

为什么要提凯岩城？ 每次您说起它的样子… 
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? The way that you talked about it...

让我以为你想念着它
I always thought that you missed it.

那里… 是你真正的家 现在 这里才是我真正的家
That you... That it was your real home. This is my real home now.

因为我的家人都在这里
Where my family lives.

妈妈 我希望你快乐
I want you to be happy, mother.

我知道
I know that.

乖孩子 我知道 但你在凯岩城不会更开心么？
I know you do, my sweet boy. But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?

我说 “亲爱的 四次就够了 你是想创造纪录么？”
I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"

结果他说“什么？这种事情还有纪录？我们一定能打破它”
And he said, "Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."

妈妈
Mother.

欢迎您
Welcome.

你看起来真美
Well don't you look lovely.

新婚让你容光焕发
Marriage agrees with you.

吃点或喝点什么?
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

要是有酒给您就好了 不过我们一般不这么早喝酒
I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.

不 不用了 我还有事
No, no, I...I can't stay.

我只想问问
I just wanted to let you know if...

还有没有什么能帮得上忙
there is ever anything I can do for you.

您真好
You are very sweet.

托曼看起来很喜欢他的新王后
Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.

我全心全意地爱慕着他
I absolutely adore him.

您养育了一个英勇的少年郎
You raised a gallant young man.

我永远都会感谢您 很好
I'm forever grateful. Good.

很好
Good.

你开心 我就放心了
I'm glad to hear you're happy.

真的 我喜不自禁
Ecstatic. I really am.

说实话 还有点力不从心
Exhausted, to be honest, but

谁叫他又是雄狮 又是雄鹿呢
what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag.

那就拜托你了
I'll leave you to it then.

噢 抱歉 我至今都没上朝堂 我有些疑惑
Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused.

现在应该怎么称呼您？
What's the proper way to address you now?

国王之母 还是王太后？
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

无须多礼
There's no need for such formalities.

国王精力如此旺盛 恐怕要不了多久
In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm,

国王之母就要当奶奶了
the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.

令人期待
That'll be a lovely day.

想想到时候的庆典
Imagine the celebrations.

他们没日没夜地敲着钟
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

记住
Remember.



要什么 找我
Anything you need.



“臭佬”
席恩・葛雷乔伊

我们不能光靠恐惧统治北境
We can't hold the North with terror alone.

要是随便哪个小领主都敢欺负我们 你根本就保不住北境
You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.

我让你去收税 不是去收尸
I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.

赛文伯爵不肯交税
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

他说北境守护永远是史塔克
He said the Warden of the North will always be a Stark,

如果他向叛徒臣服 那可是要下地狱的
and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.

你让他别无选择
You left him no choice

我活剥了他的皮
I flayed him living,

拉姆斯・雪诺
卢斯・波顿的私生子

还有他妻子的 兄弟的
along with his wife and brother.

让他儿子在旁边看着
I made his son watch.

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡公爵
北境守护

然后呢？
And?

下一任赛文伯爵交了税
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

我有重要的事情和你说
I have something important to tell you.

别吃了 好好听
Stop eating and listen.

我们人手太少 要是其他家族奋起反抗
We don't have enough men to hold the North

我们根本无法守住北境
if the other Houses rise up against us.

你明白么？
Do you understand that?

我们与兰尼斯特有约在先… 
Our pact with the Lannisters...

我和泰温・兰尼斯特有约在先
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

但是泰温・兰尼斯特死了
Tywin Lannister is dead.

剩下的兰尼斯特族人远在千里之外
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.

在七国历史上
They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms

他们从不出兵北境
sent their army this far north.

只有傻瓜才信他们会出手相助
If you think they will for us, you're a fool.

我们家族之所以强大 全靠与其他家族结盟
We become a great House by entering in alliances with other Houses,

然后通过结盟变得更加强大
and parleying those alliances into greater power.

而缔结盟约的最佳方法
Now the best way to forge a lasting alliance

可不是去剥人家的皮
isn't by peeling a man's skin off,

是联姻
the best way is marriage.

如今 你已被王室赐予了波顿这个姓氏
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

是时候娶个门当户对的新娘了
it's time you married a suitable bride.

巧的是
And as it happens,

我找到一个完美的姑娘 恰好能助我们掌控北境
I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.

珊莎・史塔克


培提尔・贝里席
“小指头” 赫伦堡公爵
峡谷守护者

那是卡林湾 正是
That's Moat Cailin. Yes.

破破烂烂的 对吧
A bit shabby, isn't it?

你来过这儿
You've been here before.

去君临时来过 同行的有我父亲 艾莉亚 还有… 
On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...

您要带我去哪儿？ 回家
Where are you taking me? Home.

波顿家族占领了临冬城
The Boltons have Winterfell.

联姻的人… 并不是您？
The marriage proposal...It wasn't for you?

不是
No.

卢斯・波顿杀了我哥哥 他背叛了我的家族！
Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!

没错
He did.

他是兰尼斯特的人
He serves the Lannisters.

目前是 我不去
For now. I won't go.

临冬城是你的家 不再是了
Winterfell is your home. Not anymore.

永远都是 你永远都是史塔克家族的一员
Always. You're a Stark.

染头发也变不了这个事实 你是珊莎・史塔克
Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark.

奈德・史塔克与凯特琳・史塔克存活于世上最年长的血脉
The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

你的根基在北境
Your place is in the North.

我不会嫁给他 您不能逼我
I can't marry him. You can't make me.

他是叛徒 是杀人犯
He's a traitor. A murderer.

我不是让你嫁给卢斯・波顿
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

不是的 你要嫁的 是他的长子与继承人 拉姆斯
No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay.

终有一天 他会成为北境守护以及…  不！
One day he'll be Warden of the North and... No!

珊莎…  不 您不能逼我
Sansa... No, you can't make me.

我宁可绝食 死也不去那里
I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.

我不会逼你做任何事情
I won't force you to do anything.

你不知道现在我有多在乎你么？
Don't you know by now how much I care for you?

你要不想去 我们立马回头 但听我说
Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me.

听我说
Listen.

你一辈子都在逃避
You've been running all your life.

家人惨遭厄运 而你只是哭泣
Terrible things happened to your family and you weep.

躲起来偷偷地为他们哀悼
You sit alone in a dark room, mourning their fates.

从你父亲被处决那天开始 你对家族的悲剧束手无策
You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.

不要再做旁观者了 听到了吗？ 不要再逃避
Stop being a bystander, you hear me? Stop running.

这个世界没有公义可言
There's no justice in the world.

除非我们亲手实现它
Not unless we make it.

你爱你的家人
You loved your family.

那就为他们复仇
Avenge them.

我们怎么通过卡林湾？
How do we get through there?

不用
We don't.

我们绕过去
We go around.

布蕾妮・塔斯
“美人”

波德瑞克・派恩
布蕾妮的侍从

那会多绕一段远路
It sets miles out of the way.

我们会跟丢的 没关系
We'll lose sight of them. Doesn't matter.

我知道他们要去哪
I know where they're going.

以你的年纪做侍从是不是有点大了？
Don't you get a bit old for a squire?

你怎么会给小恶魔做侍从的？
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

他讨厌那个绰号
He hates that nickname.

呃 反正他人又不在 也没法抱怨
Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?

五王之战期间我是罗里默爵士的侍从
I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings.

一天晚上
One night,

他喝多了酒
he had a bit too much to drink.

觉得有点饿 就借了块火腿
And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

借的？ 他不是小偷
He borrowed it? He wasn't a thief.

他又醉又饿 根本没想那么多
He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking.

我也喝多了
I was drunk too.

他给了我半块火腿
He gave me half the ham.

第二天早上
Next morning,

守卫发现他躺在货车底下 醉的不省人事
one of the guards saw him passed out,

手里还攥着吃剩的骨头
under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand.

当天下午 他就被吊死了
They hanged the man after noon.

他们也为我准备了绞索
They tied the noose for me too,

不过泰温公爵听说我姓派恩
but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne,

就赦免了我
so he pardoned me,

把我送到君临给他儿子做侍从
and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.

作为惩罚
As punishment

对你们两个都是惩罚 也不能这么说
For both of you. It didn't seem that way.

提利昂大人一直对我非常好
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

我想你服侍过的大人们都对你很好
I guess all of your lords were very kind to you.

除了我
All except me.

让你来服侍我这么个暴脾气 真是对不住
Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.

我不这么觉得 您是我见过最好的战士
I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

您打败了猎狗
You beat The Hound.

我很骄傲能成为您的侍从
I'm proud to be your squire.

抱歉我一直对你这么苛刻
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

您对我不严厉的话 我什么东西也学不到
If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.

你想成为骑士吗 波德？
You want to be a knight, Pod?

是的
Yes.

明天开始 我们每天练习两次剑法
Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day,

早晨出发之前和晚上宿营之后各一次
before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening.

我还会教你骑马的技巧
And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.

谢谢您
Thank you.

我无法封你为骑士
I can't knight you,

但我可以教你如何战斗
but I can teach you how to fight.

我想这更重要一些
I suppose that's more important.

您虽然不是骑士
You weren't a knight, but

但您曾是蓝礼・拜拉席恩的御林铁卫 是吗？
you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

是的
I was.

提利昂大人说他是个好人
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

是啊
He was.

您怎么会效忠蓝礼的？
But how did you end up serving Renly?

我还是小姑娘的时候 我父亲举办了一场舞会
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

我是他的独女 他希望能为我找一门好亲事
I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me.

他邀请了几十位年轻的贵族来塔斯
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

我不想参加 但他把我硬拉到舞厅
I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom.

舞会棒极了
And it was wonderful.

那些男孩们好像都忘记了我是多么笨拙 多么蠢大
None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was.

他们互相挑衅 甚至要决斗
The shaft each other and threatened to duel

争着与我跳舞
if they thought it was their turn to dance.

一个个悄悄对我说
Whispered in my ear

他们多么想跟我结婚 把我带回他们的城堡
how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles.

我和父亲相视而笑
My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.

我从未如此幸福
I'd never been so happy.

直到我看到几个男孩在窃笑
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

接着他们全都大笑起来 再也玩不下去这场游戏
And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer.

其实他们只是在戏弄我
They were toying with me.

他们叫我“美人”布蕾妮 天大的讽刺
Brienne the Beauty, they called me. Great joke.

我才意识到自己是世界上最丑的女孩
And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.

是个高大蠢笨的野兽
A great lumbering beast.

我想逃跑 但是蓝礼・拜拉席恩抱住我
I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

别让他们看见你的眼泪 他对我说
Don't let them see your tears, he told me.

这些下流坯
The nasty little shits,

这些下流坯不值得你流眼泪
nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.

他与我共舞 其他男孩们哑口无言
He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.

毕竟他是国王的弟弟
And he was the king's brother after all.

但是… 他不是… 
But...wasn't he...

提利昂大人说他是… 
Lord Tyrion said he was...

是的 波德 他喜欢男人 我不是傻瓜
Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot.

他并不爱我 也不想要我
He didn't love me, he didn't want me,

他和我跳舞 因为他很善良 不想看到我伤心
he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt.

他拯救了我 使我不至于成为一个笑话
He saved me from being a joke.

从那天开始
From that day

直到他生命的终点
until his last day.

我却不能挽救他性命
And I couldn't save him in return.

没有什么比不能保护你爱的人更让人悔恨
Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.

终有一天 我会为蓝礼国王报仇
One day, I will avenge King Renly.

但是您说一个影子杀死了他
But you said a shadow murdered him.

您怎能和影子战斗
How do you fight a shadow?

一个有着史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩面孔的影子
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

我知道那是史坦尼斯
I know it was Stannis.

我始终记在心里
I know it in my heart.

史坦尼斯是个人 不是影子
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

只要是人
And a man...

就能被杀死
can be killed.

总司令大人 陛下
Lord Commander. Your Grace.

我要和你单独谈谈
I'd like to speak alone.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
长城上的王

奥力是我的事务官 正如我曾是莫尔蒙总司令的事务官
Ollie is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

我希望他能参加我们的会谈 以便向经验丰富的人学习
I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience.

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令

有朝一日 他或许会成为总司令
One day, he might command.

好吧 你考虑过我的提议了吗？
Very well. Have you considered my offer?

考虑过了
I have.

我很感激您的提议 深感荣幸
And I thank you for it. You do me great honor.

我这辈子都梦想成为琼恩・史塔克
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

答应我 就能如你所愿
Say the word and you will be.

但我不得不拒绝您
But I have to refuse you.

我是守夜人的总司令
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

我属于这里
My place is here.

我是在给你提供为家族复仇的机会
I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family.

夺回你从小长大的城堡
Take back the castle where you grew up.

统治北境
To rule the North.

我也希望能跟随您一起战斗
I wish I could fight beside you.

真的 相信我
Believe me, I do.

但我在神木林立下了神圣的誓言
But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood.

发誓将一生献给守夜人
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

你就跟你父亲一样地顽固
You're as stubborn as your father.

一样有荣誉感
And as honorable.

对我来说 没有比这更高的赞扬了
I can imagine no higher praise.

这并不是赞扬
I didn't mean it as praise.

你父亲正是死于他的荣誉感
Honor got your father killed.

如果你已经打定主意 我就不再白费唇舌
But if your minds made up,I won't try to persuade you.

我想请问陛下
Can I ask Your Grace

您打算在黑城堡待多久
how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?

你已经厌烦我们了？
Are you bored of us already?

您从曼斯?雷德的手下拯救了我们
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.

我们永远不会忘记这一点
We will never forget that.

但这是关乎生存的问题
But it's a question of survival.

守夜人不可能一直为您的部队和野人俘虏提供食物
Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

嗯 凛冬将至
Mm, winter is coming.

我知道了
I know it.

两周之内我的军队就会向临冬城进发
We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.

以免被大雪困在这
Before the snows trap us here.

野人呢？
And the wildlings?

他们宁愿被烧死也不愿为我作战 随他们吧
They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it.

他们的命运由你决定
I leave their fate to you.

你可以处死他们 这是最保险的做法
You could execute them, that's the safest course.

或者你可以试试那个托蒙德
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing

是不是比曼斯更容易妥协
to compromise than Mance ever was.

我想守夜人的兄弟们更想处死野人
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.

大部分是的
Most of the brothers, yes.

自由民在这里不受欢迎
There's little love for the free folk here.

奥利
守夜人新兵

你是守夜人总司令
You're Lord Commander.

你决定吧
Your decision.

你在黑城堡树敌不少
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

有没有想过把艾里沙・索恩派到别处去
Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

比如让他去东海望做司令官
Give him command of EastwachbytheSea.

我听说最好把敌人留在你眼皮底下
I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.

这么说的人肯定没有多少敌人
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

他很看重你
He sees something in you.

或许他没有表达出来
Might not be apparent from his tone,

但这是事实 他信任你
but it's the truth. He believes in you.

很抱歉让他失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

国王的心思难以琢磨
The king is a complicated man.

但他确实希望给七国带来公正
But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.

他得先统治七国才行
As long as he's ruling them.

他是唯一合法的国王
He's the one true king.

他的血统继承权是名正言顺的
He has the blood right to that throne.

我曾发誓远离七国的政治斗争
I sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

你做到了吗？
Have you now?

守夜人誓言是怎么说的来着？
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

我想你刚来这儿就背过吧
I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.

长夜将至,我从今开始守望… 
Night gathers and now my watch begins...

不是这段 结尾那段
Not that bit, the bit at the end.

我是黑暗中的利剑
I'm the sword in the darkness,

长城中的守卫
the watcher on the walls,

守护王国的坚盾
the shield that guards the realm of men.

我将生命…  好了 够了
I pledge my life... Okay, that's enough.

守护王国的坚盾
Shield that guards the realm of men.

这才是你发誓要做到的
That's what you swore to be.

我不懂太多的大道理
Now I'm not a learned man,

但我认为守护王国最好的方法
the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting

可不是坐在世界尽头冰冷的城堡里
in a frozen castle at the edge of the world.

或许应该是踩着脏兮兮的靴子 弄得浑身泥泞
It just might mean waiting in the mud,getting your boots dirty,

也要做你该做的事
and doing what needs to be doing.

那你觉得什么才是该做的事
And what needs to be done?

只要波顿统治北境
As long as the Boltons rule the North,

北境就会受苦
the North will suffer.

一己之见而已
Just one man's opinion.

你想干嘛?
What do you want?

你是谁?
Who are you?

什么?
What?

这硬币并非你亲手挣来 你拿着它进门
You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned,

却不尊重它的价值
whose value you do not respect.

你是谁?
Who are you?

无名之辈 噢! 臭婊子!
No one. Ou! Cunt!

你撒谎 一个可悲的谎言
A lie, a sad little lie.

你是谁? 我说过 我是无...
Who are you? I told you, I'm no...

再敢这样...
Do that again and...

你是谁?
Who are you?

你会知道的
You're about to find out.

你们在做什么?
What are you doing?

我们只是在玩
We're only playing.

变脸的游戏
The game of faces.

那女孩还没准备好
That girl is not ready.

显然没有
Clearly not.

我准备好了
I am ready.

准备好什么?
For what?

准备好做你要求的任何事
For whatever you want

只要能成为无面者
to be a Faceless Man.

只要能成为无名之辈
To be no one.

那是谁的剑？
Whose sword is that?

它属于艾莉亚・史塔克
It belongs to Arya Stark.

艾莉亚・史塔克的剑 艾莉亚・史塔克的衣服
Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes,

艾莉亚・史塔克偷来的银币
Arya Stark's stolen silver.

某人想知道
A man wonders

怎么无名之辈的身边
how is it that no one

都是艾莉亚・史塔克的东西?
came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

洗干净他们之后要做什么?
What do we do with them after you wash them?

开城门!
Open gates!

停!
Hold up!

瓦妲・佛雷
"胖子"   瓦德・佛雷的孙女
卢斯・波顿的妻子

珊莎小姐 欢迎
Lady Sansa, welcome.

波顿大人
Lord Bolton.

请允许我介绍我的儿子 拉姆斯・波顿
May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?

很荣幸见到您 小姐
It's an honor to meet you, my lady

我给您拿热水来
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.

您一定想洗洗了
You must want to wash.

谢谢
Thank you.

欢迎回家 史塔克小姐
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

北境永不遗忘
The North remembers.

山姆
Sam.

伊蒙学士呢?
Maester Aemon?

他为不能到场而道歉
He apologizes for not being here.

山姆威尔・塔利
“杀手” 守夜人事务官

他不太舒服
He's not feeling well.

好好照顾他
Take good care of him.

那我喝了吧
I will drink it then.

弟兄们
Brothers.

你们都很清楚
As you all know too well,

早该挖个新茅厕了
it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.

奥赛尔・亚威克
守夜人的首席工匠

首席工匠亚威克和我已经决定委任
First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint

一位茅厕队长来监督这项重要任务
a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.

杰诺斯・史林特
守夜人
前都城守备队队长

艾里沙・索恩
守夜人教头

布莱恩
Brian.

一头黄毛的人好像挺适合这活儿
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

艾里沙爵士
Ser Alliser.

你比黑城堡的其他游骑兵都更有经验
You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.

野人攻击长城时
You proved your valour many times over

你多次证明了自己的英勇
by defending the Wall from the wildling attack.

我任命你为首席游骑兵
I name you First Ranger.

艾迪森・托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪” 守夜人事务官

杰诺斯大人
Lord Janos.

我任命你为灰卫堡指挥官
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

灰卫堡是一处废墟
Greyguard is a ruin.

是的 堡垒的状况很糟糕
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.

尽你所能将其重建
Restore it as best you can.

首席工匠亚威克可以分出...
First Builder Yarwyck can spare...

你小子还在襁褓里拉屎拉尿的时候
I was charged with the defense of King's Landing

我就执掌整个君临的防务了
when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.

留着你的废墟吧
Keep your ruin.

好啦好啦
Alright, alright.

闹够了没有
Enough of that.

你误会我了 大人
You mistake me, my Lord.

这是命令 并非提议
That was a command, not an offer.

你赶紧收拾好盔甲和武器 跟大家告别
Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells,

动身去灰卫堡
and ride for Greyguard.

我才不会服服帖帖地去被冻死呢
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

把那废墟留给个瞎了眼投票选你的傻瓜吧
Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.

我才不去
I will not have it.

你听清楚没 小鬼?
Did you hear me, boy?

我不去!
I will not have it!

你拒绝执行我的命令?
You refusing to obey my order?

你可以拿你的命令去干你那野种的屁股
You can stick your order up your bastard arse.

把杰诺斯大人拖出去
Take Lord Janos outside.

奥利 把我的剑拿来
Ollie, bring me my sword.

你不能这么做!
You cannot do this!

放开我!
Get your hands off me!

你们 你们这群渣滓!
Scum! All of you!

如果这小鬼自以为能吓唬我
If the boy thinks he can frighten me

那他就大错特错了
He's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.

这是侮辱!
A disgrace!

我有朋友 我在朝中有人!
I have friends, important friends in the capital!

咱们走着瞧!
You'll see!

大人 你要还有什么遗言
If you have any last words, my Lord...

就快说吧
now is the time.

我错了 您是总司令大人!
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander!

我们都侍奉您 我道歉 不光为这次 也为我以前的做过的事 说过的话道歉
We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said.

我错了!
I was wrong!

求您了 大人 发发慈悲 发发慈悲吧!
My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy!

我会去的! 我会的!
I'll go! I will!

求您了
Please.

我害怕
I'm afraid.

我一直都在害怕
I've always been afraid.

总主教
七神的代言人

你把我们侍奉得很好 我的孩子
You have served us well, my son.

谢谢您 天父!
Thank you, Father!

今天您要膜拜七神中的哪一位?
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

少女...少女在哪儿?
The Maiden...where is the Maiden?

还有陌客
And the Stranger.

您要知道 两人要另外加钱 晓得了晓得了
Two is extra, you realize... Yes, yes.

你们要干嘛?
What are you doing?

这是培提尔・贝里席大人的地盘 你们不能...
This establishment belongs to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...

你亵渎了我们的信仰
You have profaned our Faith.

我们父辈和先人的信仰
The Faith of our fathers and forefathers.

蓝赛尔・兰尼斯特
凯冯之子 瑟曦和詹姆的堂弟
狂热教徒

我是总主教… 
I am the High Septon of the...

你是罪人
You are a sinner.

你将为此受罚
And you shall be punished.

罪人! 罪人!
Sinner! Sinner!

罪人! 忏悔!
Sinner! Repent!

罪人! 罪人!
Sinner! Sinner!

罪人! 罪人! 罪人!
Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

罪人! 真可耻! 罪人!
Sinner! Shame on you! Sinner!

罪人!
Sinner!

陛下 大学士 提利尔大人 还有呃… 
Your Grace, Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, Uh...

没关系
It doesn't matter.

科本
被剥夺项链的学士
情报总管

作为七神信仰的总主教
As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven

我为诸神的意志代言
I give voice to the will of the Gods

我是他们在这世上最重要的仆人
and I am their foremost servant in this world.

对我的侮辱就是对诸神的侮辱
An insult to me is an insult to the Gods.

对我个人的侵犯
An assault on my person

就是对我们宗教的侵犯
is an assault on our very religion.

你被侵犯了?
You were assaulted?

是的
I was.

我被那些自称为麻雀的狂热教徒侵犯
By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows.

他们羞辱我
They humiliated me

他们打我 他们让我赤身裸体站在鹅卵石上流血
they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones.

我能活下来真是命大
I am lucky to be alive.

我听说这事是在小指头的妓院里发生的
I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.

总主教 这可是件让人不齿的事
High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.

派席尔
大学士

梅斯・提利尔
高庭公爵 玛格丽・提利尔之父
财政大臣

无论贵贱之人我都会照看
I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.

即使妓女也会得到圣母的怜悯
Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.

所以你是在关照这些虔诚妓女的需要咯?
So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

一个人的私事就应保持私密
A man's private affairs ought to stay private.

你想要我们做什么 总主教?
What do you want from us, High Septon?

我要讨个公道!
Justice!

我请求你们保护我们的教会 逮捕这些罪犯
I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals

把他们扔进黑牢
and throw them in the black cells.

我请求你们处决他们的首领
I ask that you execute their leader,

这个所谓的大麻雀
this socalled High Sparrow.

他对我们所尊重的一切构成了威胁
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.

如果他不受惩罚…  我在哪儿能找到这个人?
If he goes unpunished... And where do I find this man?

这个大麻雀?
This High Sparrow?

马林・特兰
御林铁卫

陛下 我认为这不是个好主意
I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.

胡说 马林爵士 这些都是非常虔诚的人
Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people.

我在哪儿能找到大麻雀?
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

七神保佑… 
Seven blessings...

感谢诸神
Thank the Gods.

再来一点
Just a little more.

谢谢您的汤
Thank you for the soup.

有个年轻人说我能在这里找到大麻雀 他在哪儿?
The young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?

大麻雀?
High Sparrow?

听上去很荒谬 不是吗?
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

就像小鸭大人 或者乌龟国王一样荒谬
Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle.

所以 这意味着… 
So, it's meant to...

我们往往没法摆脱敌人给我们取的绰号
We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us.

我们在七神眼中都是平等的 这个观念
The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of the Seven

让某些人难以接受 于是他们贬低我
doesn't sit well with some so they belittle me.

七神保佑你 七神保佑你 亲爱的
Seven blessings to you. Seven blessings to you, my dear.

这只是个称呼 很容易接受
It's only a name, quite an easy burden to bear.

比她的遭遇要容易承受
Far easier than hers.

为什么不穿鞋?
Why no shoes?

因为我把鞋送给更需要的人了
Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.

我们都这么做
We all do that.

这样我们就不会忘记自己究竟是谁
It stops us from forgetting what we really are.

你是因为这个来君临的吗?
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

提醒每一个人?
To remind everyone?

每一个人? 光提醒自己就够难的了
Everyone? I hardened the job reminding myself.

我告诉他们 没有人是与众不同的
Well, I tell them no one's special.

而正因为我说了这话 他们认定我与众不同
They think I'm special for telling them so.

也许他们是对的
Perhaps they're right.

相信这一点让人心安 不是吗?
It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it?

诸神派你来考验我?
The Gods sent you here to tempt me?

希望并非如此
I hope not.

我猜
I'd assumed

你来这里就是为了抓我的
you'd only come here to arrest me.

因为总主教遭遇的意外
For that incident with the High Septon.

如此对待七神在凡间指定的代言人
An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative

有点过分了 您说是不是？
of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

伪善就像是一块脓肿
Hypocrisy is a boil.

切开它并不好受
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

不过 他们原本可以在动刀子的时候更小心一些的
Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.

总主教今天找我谈过了
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

他并不希望我逮捕你 而是希望我处决你
He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.

我不敢妄图揣测圣意
I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.

我对这件事的看法与你一致
My thoughts on the matter align with your own.

总主教的行为堕落 态度可憎
The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude.

让这样的人留在圣堂里 会从内部侵蚀人们的信仰
Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside.

所以现在他搬到红堡的地牢去了
So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead.

信仰与王权是支撑着整个世界的两根支柱
The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.

如果其中一根倒塌了 另一根也难以幸免
If one collapses, so does the other.

我们必须尽一切努力
We must do everything necessary

来保护对方才行
to protect one another.

陛下
Your Grace.

派只信鸦去把这封信送给小指头
Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger

不管他是在鹰巢城还是其他什么地方
in the Eyrie or wherever he's slithering about.

我这就去 陛下
At once, Your Grace.

你的工作开展得如何？ 非常顺利
How's your work coming along? Very well.

取得了什么进展吗？ 比我预期的进展更多
You've made progress? More than I've expected.

虽然还有着很长的路要走
Still a way to go, but...

很好 那你接着干吧
Very good. I'll leave you to it then.

确保小指头明白“立即”这个词是什么意思
Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediate".

嘘… 
Shh...

放松点 伙计
Easy, friend.

过来 孩子们
Come on, children.

她真是可爱
She really is lovely.

希望我能让她开心
I hope I can make her happy.

我也希望如此
I hope so too.

一路走来 我可是越发喜欢珊莎小姐了
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.

她经历得太多
She suffered enough.

我绝对不会伤害她的
I'll never hurt her.

我向您保证
You have my word.

我很少听说关于你的事情
I've heard very little about you.

对于贵族老爷们来说 这可不太寻常
Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.

我不久前才刚刚成为贵族
I haven't been a lord very long.

过去我是个私生子 而现在不是了
I was a bastard. And you're not anymore.

让我和贝里席大人单独谈一谈
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

好的 父亲 谢谢您 贝里席大人
Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish.

我永远感激您
I'm forever in your debt.

他看起来很满意
He seems pleased.

他不该满意吗？
Shouldn't he be?

我向您确保珊莎还是个处女
I assure you she's still a virgin.

提利昂和她没有圆房 根据七国的法律 她并未成婚
Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife.

如果您不信的话可以检查她
Inspect her, if you must.

这个事情妓院老板操心就好了
I leave that to the brothel keeper.

我要的是她的姓氏 而不是她的贞操
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

我给您带来了允诺的一切
I have delivered everything I've promised.

您还得负责善后
And you prepared for the consequences.

兰尼斯特家族要是得知我把珊莎许给拉姆斯可不会善罢甘休
When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.

兰尼斯特的名头已经不复以往
The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.

泰温已死
Tywin is dead.

过去是他凭借一己之力维持着家族的强盛
He kept his house in power through sheer will.

没了他
Without him,

詹姆只有一只手 又缺乏盟友
Jaime has one hand and no allies,

托曼不过是个温和的小男孩
Tommen is a soft boy,

身为国王根本不足为惧
not a king to fear.

王后定会怒不可遏
The Queen will be enraged.

玛格丽王后很喜欢珊莎
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

瑟曦现在是王太后了
Cersei is Queen Mother,

随着时间流逝 她会越来越边缘化
a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.

可她如今依然有盟友
And yet she still has friends.

这些盟友身居要职 她尽可以找他们帮忙
men in important places, whom she can ask for favours.

这封信是瑟曦寄给您的
A message for you, from Cersei Lannister.

破晓前不久 一个骑手从鹰巢城送来
A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn.

显然 她以为您还在谷地
Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.

您说这封信是给我的
A message for me, you say.

可它的封蜡却被拆开了
Strange that the seal is broken.

相信您能理解 贝里席大人
I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish.

您在夜里收到了来自王太后的消息
If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother,

这让我不得不对我们新成立的联盟心怀疑虑
it does make me question our new alliance.

兰尼斯特让您跻身维斯特洛最具权势的领主之列
Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros.

然而 您现在却身在北境 置他们于不利
Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them.

何必赌上如今的地位来冒险呢？
Why gamble with your position?

实现野心的每一步都是一次赌博
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

您赌了一把 将匕首插进了罗柏・史塔克的心脏
You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart.

看起来收获颇丰啊
It appears that your gamble paid off.

现在您是北境守护了
You're Warden of the North.

我原本有泰温・兰尼斯特的支持
I had Tywin Lannister backing.

现在谁来做我的后援 您吗？
Who supports me now? You?

鹰巢城是我的
The Eyrie is mine.

上一次谷地与北境的领主联手的时候
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North,

他们推翻了有史以来最伟大的王朝
they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.

我得跟您借只鸟儿
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

瑟曦等着我回复呢
Cersei will expect a reply.

我也得看看您的回复
I'd like to read the reply.

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

我要下车
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

瓦兰提斯可是一座大城市
Volantis is a large city.

我要下车
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

您在这里被发现的几率
The likelihood of you being spotted here

可比其他地方高上一百倍
increases a hundred fold.

我要下车
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

我不知道还能怎样变着法子拒绝您了
I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.

如果脑子被憋坏了
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen

我对丹妮莉丝・坦格利安就一点用也没有了
if I lose my mind.

除了你的脸外 我已经想不起来别人的脸是什么样子了
I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.

我的脸可是完美无瑕呢
It's a perfectly good face.

我这脑子是真坏了
I'm losing my mind.
