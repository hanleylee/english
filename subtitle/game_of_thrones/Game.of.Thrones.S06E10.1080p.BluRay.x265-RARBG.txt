I humble myself before the Seven

接受任何诸神认为公正的惩罚
and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.

诸神的惩罚是残忍的
The gods' judgment is fierce,

也是公平的
but also fair.

战士对自以为可以逍遥法外之人
The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves

施以惩罚
beyond the reach of justice.

But the Mother shows her mercy

示以仁慈
to those who kneel before her.

及与家族相关的一切
and all that goes with it.

我将放弃贵族身份及在高庭的一切权利

永不娶妻

永不生子
and I will never father children.

洛拉斯兄弟

我要求你将生命献于七神
...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.

你会为了保卫自己的信仰
Will you fight to defend your faith

与异教徒和叛教者斗争到底吗？
against heretics and apostates?

那么王太后现在何处？

别急 大学士 我对你并无恶意
Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will.

如果可以 请原谅我
Please forgive me if you can.

我也不忍心这样 大人
This pains me, my lord.

无论您做错过什么 您都不应孤独地死在
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve

这样一个冰冷黑暗的地方
to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

但有时我们唯有辞旧
But sometimes before we can usher in the new,

才能迎新
the old must be put to rest.

你躲得越久 下场越惨
The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you.

你要干什么？
What are you doing?

凯冯·兰尼斯特
法务大臣 摄政王 全境守护者

事情有些不对
There's something wrong.

您不必担心 陛下
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

审判不久便会开始

你觉得他们为什么不在？
Why do you think they're not here?

如果被控告之人不到场
If the accused is not here,

她的审判仍要进行
she will be tried regardless.

谁都不能摆脱诸神的裁决… 
We cannot escape the justice of the gods...

忘了你那些神吧 现在听我说！
Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you!

瑟曦知道她不到场的后果
Cersei understands the consequences of her absence

而她还是没来
and she is absent anyway,

这意味着她不打算承担这些后果
which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.

推迟审判 我们必须全部离开
The trial can wait. We all need to leave.

我们现在必须全部离开！
We all need to leave now!

洛拉斯

乌尼亚
修女

坦白
Confess.

坦白

No. Confess.

坦白 这令人愉悦
Confess. It felt good.

殴打我 饿着我
Beating me, starving me,

恐吓我 羞辱我
frightening me, humiliating me.

你这样做不是因为你关心我能否赎罪
You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.

你这样做是因为这令你愉悦

没有什么更快乐的事了
No thought has ever given me greater joy.

时机对了 连坦白都这么令人愉悦
Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.

你一直都很沉默
You've always been quiet.

我说过 我会是你死之前看到的最后一个人

还记得么？
Do you remember?

好吧

黑瓦德·佛雷
“黑瓦德”

致以亲切问候”
send their regards."

波隆
骑士

你压根什么事情都不用做 对吧？
You don't even have to do anything, do you?

你坐在那 好像一大块牛肉
You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,

其他人就跟鸟儿一样飞过来啄食
and all the birds come pecking.

要上她的话不用跟我客气 她才不想要我
You're welcome to her. She doesn't want me.

她那下面要的是你的金手指
She wants your golden fingers up her twat.

那两个可是盯着你呢
Those two have their eyes on you.

他们盯着的是你 傻逼
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

不是我的菜
Not my type.

头发还不够黄？
Not blonde enough?

女士们 来认识一下黑水湾的波隆爵士
Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

他可是黑水湾之战的英雄
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

收了吧 我不是很有兴致
There you go. Maybe I'm not in the mood.

操它的
Fuck it.

没必要因为我是一个受封的骑士就叫爵士
No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.

这次事情进展顺利
This came together rather well.

你的父亲肯定会很满意
Your father would be pleased.

我敢保证他一定是
I'm sure he would be.

艾德慕已经重新关押了
Edmure is back in a cell.

不能杀了我的女婿 这可不对
Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right.

会损害家族名声
Give the family a bad name.

所以大名鼎鼎的黑鱼是被小卒杀死的 对吧？
So the famous Blackfish killed by foot soldiers, eh?

话都传开了 一代传奇就这么… 
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

您会亲自上战场打仗吗 佛雷大人？
Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?

我年纪大了玩不了
I'm a bit old for all that.

不 说的是你年轻的时候
No, but back in your day.

打仗的目的
The purpose of fighting

是击败对手 不是吗？
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

我打败了我的对手们
I've defeated mine.

奔流城已经被徒利家族统治了一千年
Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years.

现在是我的了
Now it's mine.

这叫什么？
What do you call that?

胜利
Victory.

是的 你是一个伟大的征服者
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

来啊 取笑我啊 小子 你以为我介意吗？
Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

徒利家族取笑了我那么多年
The Tullys mocked me for years.

史塔克家族也取笑过我
The Starks mocked me.

他们现在在哪？
Where are they now?

你说起战争的时候像个专家
You talk about war as if you're an expert,

但我记得有一场你参与的战斗
but the one battle I remember you fighting,

你被少狼主罗柏·史塔克俘虏了
you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.

不过也不重要
But it doesn't matter.

我们两个弑君者在这坐得好好的
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

我们知道那些人当着面卑躬屈膝
We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces

背后却冷言冷语
and snigger behind our backs.

我们不在乎 对吧？
We don't mind, do we?

恐惧是件不可思议的事情
Fear is a marvelous thing.

可他们不害怕佛雷家
They don't fear the Freys, though.

他们害怕的是兰尼斯特家
They fear the Lannisters.

我们给了你河间地是让你守住这里
We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.

如果你每次都搞丢
If we have to ride north and take them back for you

每次都要我们来替你夺回地盘
every time you lose them,

那我们要你有何用？
why do we need you?

给我看
Show me.

陛下  没必要… 
Your Grace, there's no need...

给我看
Show me.

您对陛下的葬礼有什么想法？
What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?

鉴于贝勒大圣堂已不再适合
As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option,

或许在王座厅举行仪式？
perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

他应该和他外祖父
He should be with his grandfather,

以及哥哥 妹妹一起
his brother, his sister.

烧了吧
Burn him

把他的骨灰埋在大圣堂的废墟
and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.

为什么？
Why?

军队被困 马匹都快死了
The army was trapped. The horses were dying.

那是唯一的办法 你活活烧死了一个小女孩！
It was the only way. You burned a little girl alive!

我只是奉真主之命行事
I only do what my Lord commands.

如果他命令你烧死孩子 那他便是邪恶的
If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil.

我们因为他才能活下来
We are standing here because of him.

琼恩·雪诺能复活 也都是真主的旨意
Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.

我爱那个孩子 我对她视如己出
I loved that girl like she was my own.

她是个好孩子 善良的孩子 你却杀了她！

这也是她父亲的意思

那办法有用吗？
The only way for what?

你告诉每个人史坦尼斯就是预言中那个人
You told everyone Stannis was the one.

你让史坦尼斯相信你 所有人都被耍了

对 你弄错了

多少人因为你的错而死？

我请求您以谋杀罪处决这个女人
I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder.

她已承认了罪行
She admits to the crime.

你有什么要为自己辩护的吗？
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

多少年前我就准备去死了
I've been ready to die for many years.

如果光之王不需要我了 我随时可以去死 但他还需要我
If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.

你见过夜王 琼恩·雪诺
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

你知道大战在即
You know the great war is still to come.

The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in.

而他们是因你而来
They came because of you.

你告诉我是贝里席大人把你卖给了波顿家
You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.

是他 你信任他？
He did. And you trust him?

傻瓜才会信任小指头
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

我应该告诉你的
I should have told you about him,

告诉你谷地骑士的事
about the Knights of the Vale.

对不起
I'm sorry.

我们必须信任彼此
We need to trust each other.

我们不能起内讧
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

我们现在有太多的敌人
We have so many enemies now.

琼恩

上一个提利尔来多恩的时候

他被杀掉了
he was assassinated.

一百个红蝎子 对吗？
100 red scorpions, was it?

你不必害怕我们 奥莲娜夫人

让成年女人说话吧

当你进攻君临时 兰尼斯特家就无处可逃了
the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.

达里奥·纳哈里斯
雇佣兵

你不去维斯特洛
You're not going to Westeros.

你和次子团在这儿守着
You're staying here with the Second Sons.

弥林终于迎来了和平

弥林人将推选自己的领导人 而你来维护和平
You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.

去他的弥林
Fuck Meereen.

去他的人民

我来在这儿是为了你 不是为了他们
I'm here for you, not them.

你答应过我
You promised me.

“我的剑是你的了 我的生命也是你的”
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

这就是我的命令
This is what I command.

如果我要统治维斯特洛
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

就需要缔结联盟
I'll need to make alliances.

最好的方式便是联姻
The best way to make alliances is with marriage.

这次你要嫁给谁？
Who are you marrying this time?

不知道 也许不嫁
I don't know. Maybe no one.

但你需要引诱那些大贵族们？
But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table?

你是个女王还是个鱼饵？
Are you a queen or fish bait?

我不能把情人带回维斯特洛
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

一个国王会毫不犹豫的带回去
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

这就是你想要的喽？成为我的男宠？

我不为此骄傲 但我也不在乎哪个喷香水的贵族

聪明的家伙 无可反驳的逻辑

我在那边对你没有用
I'm no use to you over there.

别生气
Don't get angry.

我没生气 只是自怨自艾罢了
I'm not angry. I'm full of selfpity.

谁才能追随你呢？
Who comes after you?

谁有资格追随风暴降生的丹妮莉丝 龙之母？
Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

我想 会有一大帮女人吧
A great number of women, I imagine.

关于维护弥林和巨龙湾的详细指令
Specific orders will be left for you

将会留给你
regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.

巨龙湾？
Bay of Dragons?

我们不能再继续叫它奴隶湾了 是吧？
We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?

你会得到那个你期待已久的王座 我非常确定
You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.

我希望那能带给你快乐
I hope it brings you happiness.

我十分同情维斯特洛的领主们

Farewell, Daario Naharis.

提利昂·兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

他反应如何？
How did he take it?

没掉泪
No tears.

我知道对你而言很难说出口
I know it was hard for you.

你拒绝了一个真正爱你的男人
You turned away a man who truly loves you

就因为他可能成为你在七大王国的负担
because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

但正是这种自我牺牲 让你成为一个伟大的统治者
That's the kind of selfsacrifice that makes for a good ruler,

如果这么说能安慰你的话
if it's any consolation.

不能
It's not.

是啊 我也觉得不能
No, I suppose not.

我不擅长安慰别人
I'm terrible at consoling.

是啊 你的确不擅长
Yes, you really are.

好 那来谈谈眼前发生的一切吧？
All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening?

你有了军队 有了舰船
You have your armies, you have your ships,

你还有龙
you have your dragons.

你已经拥有了
Everything you've ever wanted

所有打懂事起想拥有的东西
since you were old enough to want anything,

任你差遣
it's all yours for the taking.

你害怕吗？
Are you afraid?

很好
Good.

你现在已经身处权力的游戏之中
You're in the great game now.

而权力的游戏是很可怕的
And the great game's terrifying.

那些不怕失败的
The only people who aren't afraid of failure

都是你父亲那种疯子
are madmen like your father.

你知道我害怕的是什么吗？
Do you know what frightens me?

我与一个爱我的男人告别
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

一个我以为我在乎的人
A man I thought I cared for.

但我毫无感觉
And I felt nothing.

只是不耐烦得说出来
Just impatient to get on with it.

他不是第一个爱你的人
He wasn't the first to love you

也不会是最后一个
and he won't be the last.

好吧 你安慰我这件事 彻底失败了
Well, you have completely failed to console me.

好吧 听我说 自打记事起 我就是个愤世嫉俗的人
For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember.

每个人都和我说 让我信点什么… 
Everyone's always asking me to believe in things...

家庭 七神 国王 我自己
family, gods, kings, myself.

听起来非常诱人
It was often tempting

直到我看见信仰把人们变成什么样子
until I saw where belief got people.

所以我说不 你们还是把信仰留给自己吧
So I said no, thank you to belief.

而如今我在这
And yet here I am.

我相信你
I believe in you.

很尴尬 真的
It's embarrassing, really.

我都可以拔剑起誓
I'd swear you my sword,

可惜我没有佩剑
but I don't actually own a sword.

我需要的是你的谏言
It's your counsel I need.

它们属于您
It's yours.

从现在直到永远
Now and always.

好
Good.

我… 
I...

我给你做了件东西
I had something made for you.

我不确定做得对不对
I'm not sure if it's right.

提利昂·兰尼斯特
Tyrion Lannister,

我命你为女王之手
I name you Hand of the Queen.

你不是我女儿 是吧？
You're not one of mine, are you?

不是 老爷
No, my lord.

我也觉得不是
Didn't think so.

你太漂亮了
Too pretty.

我那些该死的白痴儿子都在哪儿？
Where are my damn moron sons?!

黑瓦德和罗索答应过中午就到
Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.

他们在这儿 老爷
They're here, my lord.

在这儿 那他们在干什么？ 修剪屌毛吗？
Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?

告诉他们立刻过来
Tell them to come here now.

但他们已经在这儿了 老爷
But they're already here, my lord.

在这儿 老爷
Here, my lord.

切开他们可不那么容易
They weren't easy to carve.

尤其是黑瓦德
Especially Black Walder.

什么… 
What...

我的名字是艾莉亚·史塔克
My name is Arya Stark.

艾莉亚·史塔克
“奈德”和凯特琳的次女

我希望你知道
I want you to know that.

你这辈子所见的最后一件事
The last thing you're ever going to see

就是死时看着史塔克家族的人冲你微笑
is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.

原谅我 小姐
Forgive me, my lady...

如果我打断了你的祈祷… 
if you're at prayer.

我已经不再祈祷了
I'm done with all that.

在我还是个小女孩时 每天都来这里
I came here every day when I was a girl.

祈祷自己能去别的地方
I prayed to be somewhere else.

那时 我只想到自己想要什么 从没想过我拥有什么
Back then I only thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.

培提尔·贝里席
“小指头”

我太蠢了
I was a stupid girl.

那时你还是个孩子
You were a child.

你想要什么？
What do you want?

我以为你知道
I thought you knew what I wanted.

我不知道
I was wrong.

不 你知道
No, you weren't.

每次需要做决定前
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

我都会闭上眼睛 看到同一个画面
I close my eyes and see the same picture.

每当我要采取行动时 我都会问自己
Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself

这会帮我把画面的内容变成现实吗？
will this action help to make this picture a reality?

把它拽出脑海
Pull it out of my mind

放到现实中？
and into the world?

只有在答案肯定时 我才会行动
And I only act if the answer is yes.

一副我自己… 
A picture of me...

坐在铁王座上… 
on the Iron Throne...

而你坐我在身边的画面
and you by my side.

很美的画面
It's a pretty picture.

这场大战的消息很快会传遍七大王国
News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

所有人都会知道 我为史塔克家族而战
I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.

你也曾效忠过别的家族 贝里席大人
You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.

可你从未停止过为自己谋利
It's never stopped you from serving yourself.

过去的已经过去
The past is gone for good.

你可以坐在这感伤时光的流逝
You can sit here mourning its departure

或者去为未来做好准备
or you can prepare for the future.

你 吾爱
You, my love,

就是史塔克家族的未来
are the future of House Stark.

北境联盟会站在谁的身后？
Who should the North rally behind?

是奈德与凯特琳·史塔克在临冬城
A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark

生下的嫡女
born here at Winterfell

还是生于南方没有母亲的私生子？
or a motherless bastard born in the south?

我们就此别过吧
This is where I leave you.

你不跟我们一起走吗？
You're not coming with us?

班扬·史塔克
“奈德”的弟弟

长城不仅仅是冰和石头
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

古老的咒语被镌刻在它的地基之中

向我保证 奈德
Promise me, Ned.

你不能指望着谷地的骑士
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

与野人侵略者们并肩而战
to side with wildling invaders.

我们没有侵略 我们是被邀请的
We didn't invade. We were invited.

我可没请
Not by me.

自由民 北方人
The free folk, the northerners,

以及谷地的骑士们共同英勇杀敌
and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,

并肩奋战 方才取得胜利
fought together, and we won.

我父亲曾经常说在战场上见真朋友
My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.

波顿已败
The Boltons are defeated.

战争结束了
The war is over.

凛冬已至
Winter has come.

如果学士们是对的 那这将是一千年来最冷的冬天
If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years.

我们应该回家 做好抵御风暴的准备
We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.

战争尚未结束
The war is not over.

我对你保证 朋友
And I promise you, friend,

真正的敌人不会等到风暴结束

但莫尔蒙家族不忘
But House Mormont remembers.

北境不忘
The North remembers.

除史塔克之外再无北境之王
We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.

我不在乎他是否是私生子
I don't care if he's a bastard.

他流着奈德·史塔克的血液
Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.

从今天直到最后 他都是我的国王
He's my king from this day until his last day.

莫尔蒙小姐的话不中听
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

却是真话
and truly.

我的儿子为少狼主罗柏·史塔克而死

但我错了
But I was wrong.

我将为此终生抱憾
and I will regret that until my dying day.

一个人犯错时必须承认错误
A man can only admit when he was wrong

然后请求原谅

There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

更多的战斗即将接踵而至
There will be more fights to come.

葛洛佛家族将追随史塔克家族
House Glover will stand behind House Stark

正如千年来我们所做的一样
as we have for a thousand years.
