第一季第五集  The Wolf and the Lion
狮狼之争

修夫
琼恩・艾林的侍从

修夫爵士在都城有亲戚吗？
Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?

没有
No.

昨晚是我亲自替他守的灵
I stood vigil for him myself last night.

这孩子无依无靠
He had no one else.

他没穿过盔甲
He'd never worn this armor before.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
御林铁卫队长

很不幸
Bad luck for him

他的对手是魔山
going against the Mountain.

他怎么对上魔山的？
Who determines the draw?

比武对阵是抽稻草签决定的 史塔克大人
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

那是
Aye.

可抽签是谁主持的呢？
But who holds the straws?

辛苦了 姐妹们
You've done good work, sisters.

人生真是变化无常
Life is strange. Not so many years ago

曾几何时我们还在三叉戟河上各为其主
we fought as enemies at the trident.

我很庆幸没在战场上跟你交手 巴利斯坦爵士
I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.

艾德・史塔克
御前首相 临冬城公爵 昵称“奈德”

我夫人也该感到庆幸
As is my wife.

做寡妇的滋味可不好受
I don't think the widow's life would suit her.

您太谦虚了
You're too modest.

我亲眼见您斩杀了十几位著名的骑士
I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.

家父曾对我说
My father once told me

你是他见过的最棒的骑士
you were the best he'd ever seen.

在打仗这些事情上 他从没看走眼
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.

你父亲是个人才
He was a fine man, your father.

疯王对他做的那些 实在是可耻的罪行
What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.

那小伙子...
And that lad

几个月前还仅是个侍从
he was a squire until a few months ago.

怎么置办得起一套新盔甲？
How could he afford a new suit of armor?

或许艾林大人给他留了些钱吧？
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?

听说国王打算参加今天的长枪比武
I hear the King wants to joust today.

他是想去 但这不可能
Yes, that will never happen.

劳勃向来是为所欲为
Robert tends to do what he wants.

如果听任国王为所欲为
If the King got what he wanted all the time,

国家将永无宁日
he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.

这盔甲太小 陛下 穿不上
It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.

放屁 你老妈是个
Your mother was a dumb whore

蓝赛尔・兰尼斯特
国王的侍从 王后的堂弟

大屁股的蠢婊子
with a fat ass. Did you know that?

瞧这呆子！没脑子 还缺个蛋！
Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.

连帮人穿盔甲都不会
He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.

是你太胖了 这才穿不下
You're too fat for your armor.

太胖？太胖 是吗？
Fat? Fat, is it?

你对国王是这样讲话的吗？
Is that how you speak to your King?

很好笑 是不是？
That was funny, is it?

不 陛下
No, Your Grace.

不好笑？你不喜欢首相的笑话？
No? You don't like the Hand's joke?

你就饶了这可怜孩子吧
You're torturing the poor boy.

听见首相的话了吗？国王太胖了 穿不下盔甲
You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor.

去拿胸甲撑子快去啊！
Go find the breastplate stretchernow!

“胸甲撑子”？
"The breastplate stretcher"?

他要花多久才能闹明白呢？
How long before he figures it out?

或许你该为自己发明一套
Maybe you should have one invented.

好了 好了
All right, all right.

待会你看我的就是了 老子要露一手枪法
But you watch me out thereI still know how to point a Lance.

长枪比武与你无关 这是年轻人的事
You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.

怎么？我是国王就不能打？见鬼 我不过想打打人罢了！
Why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

那谁敢对你动手呢？ 谁都行
And who's going to hit you back? Anybody who can.

反正最后坐在马鞍上的就是... 就是你
And the last man in his saddleWill be you.

七国上下没有人
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms

敢冒触怒你的风险对你动手
would risk hurting you.

你的意思是那些胆小鬼会故意失手？
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?

可想而知
Aye.

喝 我不渴
Drink. I'm not thirsty.

快喝 这是国王的命令
Drink. Your King commands it.

诸神在上
Gods,

我竟然胖得穿不下自己的铠甲
too fat for my armor.

你的侍从...是兰尼斯特家的人？
Your squire... A Lannister boy?

哼 一个该死的白痴
Mm. A bloody idiot,

劳勃・拜拉席恩
国王

瑟曦却坚持要我收下
but Cersei insisted.

说来这都要感谢琼恩・艾林
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

“瑟曦・兰尼斯特是个好对象”
"Cersei Lannister will make a good match," she told me.

“娶她可以确保她父亲的支持”
"You'll need her father on your side."

我从前总以为当了国王就可以为所欲为
I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted.

罢了罢了 去看他们打吧
Enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride.

闻闻血腥味总可以吧
At least I can smell someone else's blood.

劳勃？ 又怎么了？
Robert? What?

这副模样威武得过头了 嘿嘿？
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

过来向你们的国王致敬！快鞠躬 废物们！
Come, bow before your King! Bow, you shits!

艾莉亚呢？ 去上她的舞蹈课了
Where's Arya? At her dancing lessons.

when will you be having your friend?

茉丹
临冬城的修女

洛拉斯知道他那母马在发情
Loras knew his mare was in heat.

真是有心计
Quite crafty, really.

洛拉斯爵士才不会这么做
Ser Loras would never do that.

这么做毫无荣誉可言
There's no honor in tricks.

没有荣誉 但足以赢钱
No honor and quite a bit of gold.

拿剑来！
Sword!

不准碰他！
Leave him be!

And why would I do that? Why not?

怕我逃跑不成？
Am I going to run?

山上的原住民为了这双靴子就会杀我

你现在该担心的不是影子山猫和原住民
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.

噢 朝东的路
Ah, the eastern road.

我们是要去谷地
We're going to the Vale.

去你妹妹那里

为着莫须有的罪名审判我

She's changed.

She was always a bit touched, but now

提利昂・兰尼斯特
王后幼弟 "小恶魔"

你不如就地把我宰了
you might as well kill me here.

我不是谋杀犯 兰尼斯特 我也不是！
I am not a murderer, Lannister. Neither am I!

谋害贵公子的事与我毫无瓜葛
I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.

那把匕首... 怎样的笨蛋

怎么说得上是在保护它？
if she's not with her family?

你母亲守在你的病床前
Your mother sat by your bed

守了三个多星期...
for three weeks while you slept

然后她就走了！
and then she left!

你妈生你的时候
When you were born, I was the one

是我接的生
who pulled you from your mother.

我亲手把你放进她怀里
I placed you in her arms.

我知道从那一刻起 直到她去世
From that moment until the moment she dies,

她都会一直爱着你
she will love you.

无条件爱着你
Absolutely.Fiercely.

那她为什么要走？

但她很快就会回家的 你知道她在哪儿吗？
but she will be home soon. Do you know where she is now?

现在在哪儿？
Today?

No, I don't.

孩子啊 有时候刨根究底并不是好事

我再也不能射箭了

罗丝
妓女

带你进城堡可是犯禁的

对你来说当然是大人物
Important enough for the likes of you.

知道吗 你不是我惟一睡过的贵族大爷

还有他的舌头

我看他是舍得破费
Generous tipper.

兰尼斯特确实不把钱当钱使

你真的在吃醋
You are jealous.

我是葛雷乔伊家的人
I'm a Greyjoy.

三百年来 我们身为铁群岛之主
We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

维斯特洛大陆上没有哪家贵族敢小瞧我们
There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us,

包括兰尼斯特
not even the Lannisters.

那史塔克呢？

我八岁那年被史塔克大人收为养子

养子...好个冠冕堂皇的称呼
A wardthat's a nice word for it.

你老爸起兵反叛劳勃国王
Your father rebelled against King Robert

据说他还贼心不死... 我父亲

我可以坐吗？
May I?

我告诉您的话若是传出去
If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you,

我就得掉脑袋
off comes my head.

瓦里斯
太监 情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

到时候谁会哀悼可怜的瓦里斯呢？
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

天南地北 没有人会为蜘蛛歌唱啊
North or South, they sing no songs for spiders.

但有些事您必须知情
But there are things you must know.

您是御前首相 国王却是蠢才一个
You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool

我知道 您是他的挚友
your friend, I know, but a fool

您若不救他 这个蠢才注定完蛋
and doomed unless you save him.

我来都城一个月了
I've been in the capital a month.

你为何不早告诉我？
Why have you waited so long to tell me this?

因为我不信任您
I didn't trust you.

那你又为何转变了看法？
So why do you trust me now?

监视着您一举一动的
The Queen is not the only one

不止是王后
who has been watching you closely.

在都城里重荣誉的人屈指可数
There are few men of honor in the capital.

您是其中之一
You are one of them.

此外 您别见怪
I would like to believe I am another,

我认为我自己也是其中之一
strange as that may seem.

国王怎么个完蛋法？
What sort of doom does the King face?

恐怕是与琼恩・艾林相似的方式
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

那东西叫“里斯之泪”
The tears of Lys, they call it.

非常罕见 价格高昂
A rare and costly thing,

味道清甜如水
as clear and tasteless as water.

不留一丝痕迹
It leaves no trace.

谁下的毒？
Who gave it to him?

显然是某个与他亲近的朋友 但是哪一个呢？
Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one?

可疑对象太多了
There were many.

艾林大人是个和蔼又值得信赖的人哪
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

不过确有这么个孩子
There was one boy.

他的一切都是琼恩・艾林给的
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

那个侍从？修夫爵士？
The squire, Ser Hugh?

他真是死不逢时
Pity what happened to him,

正要大展宏图 却...
just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.

如果说是修夫爵士下的毒...
If Ser Hugh poisoned him

又是谁收买他的呢？
who paid Ser Hugh?

显然是某个有钱人
Someone who could afford it.

琼恩生性平和
Jon was a man of peace.

他已经当了十七年的首相
He was Hand for 17 years

治理了国家十七年
17 good years.

为什么现在要对他下手？
Why kill him?

因为他开始问问题了
He started asking questions.

他已经找到了一个私生子
He's found one bastard already.

他也拿到了那本书
He has the book.

迟早会查出真相
The rest will come.

等查出真相 他会怎么做？
And when he knows the truth, what will he do?

只有天上诸神知道
The gods alone know.

那群蠢蛋想杀他儿子
The fools tried to kill his son.

更糟的是 他们还搞砸了
What's worsethey botched it.

狼和狮很快就会打成一团
The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.

要开战了 我的老友 现在开战有什么用？
We will be at war soon, my friend. What good is war now?

我们还没准备好
We're not ready.

死了一个首相 为什么不能死第二个？
If one Hand can die, why not a second?

伊利里欧・摩帕提斯
潘托斯总督

如今的首相不一样
This Hand is not the other.

艾莉亚・史塔克
临冬城公爵次女

我们需要时间
We need time.

在儿子诞生前 卓戈卡奥是不会出兵的
Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.

你也清楚那些野蛮人是什么德行
You know how these savages are.

你叫我拖一拖 我却要叫你加快行动啊
"Delay," you say. "Move fast," I reply.

这已经不再是两人对弈的游戏了
This is no longer a game for two players.

如果曾经是的话
It never was.

第一个上朝 最后一个离开
The first to arrive and the last to leave.

你的勤勉实在令人钦佩
I admire your industry.

你真是悄无声息
You do move quietly.

我们都得有点特才嘛
We all have our qualities.

你今天看上去有点寂寞
You look a bit lonely today.

要不晚上去我的窑子耍一趟
You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.

今天有新来的童子
First boy is on the house.

恐怕我对这个没兴趣
I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.

是吗？
Am I?

那些天天在你耳边叽喳的小小鸟儿
All those birds that whisper in your ear

他们是多可爱的小东西啊
such pretty little things.

放心
Trust me,

我可以安排各种娱乐
we accommodate all inclinations.

噢 我对此深信不疑
Oh, I'm sure.

比如雷德温大人要的孩童就特别小
Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.

我是美的传播者和秘密的守护者
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion

两者对我同等重要
both equally important.

但我确实认为“美”是很主观的 不是吗？
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?

谣传说
Is it true that

腾石河的玛龙爵士偏好截肢残疾人
Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?

只要他出得起钱 又有什么不可以
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.

我还听过一个恶心的谣言
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord

说某位陛下的最爱是新鲜尸体
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

安排这种娱乐想必很费劲吧
Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.

跑腿的可怜虫
The logistics alone

得赶在漂亮尸体腐烂前找到他们
to find beautiful corpses before they rot.

严格意义上说
Strictly speaking, such a thing

国王的律法禁止提供此类服务
would not be in accordance with the King's laws.

严格意思上说
Strictly speaking.

告诉我...你的卵蛋是不是还
Tell medoes someone somewhere

存在某地某人的某个小箱子里？
keep your balls in a little box?

我对此很好奇
I've often wondered.

你我共事多年
Do you know I have no idea where they are?

你知道我对此一无所知
And we had been so close.

先别说我了
But enough about me. How have you been

自从上次见面以来 你过得可好？
since we last saw each other?

自从上次你见到我 还是我见到你？
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?

上次我见到你
Now the last time I saw you,

你是在跟首相谈话
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

你亲眼所见？ 我的眼线所见
Saw me with your own eyes? Eyes I own.

不过是商谈国事
Council business.

奈德・史塔克新官上任 千头万绪
We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.

你对史塔克夫人的一番深情厚谊
Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness

实在是打动人心
for Lord Stark's wife.

假如说是你
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life

让史塔克家得出了
and it was discovered that you helped

兰尼斯特要对他们家孩子下手的结论
the Starks come to that conclusion...

而这要让王后得知了只言片语...
To think a simple word to the Queen

后果真是不堪设想
one shudders at the thought.

你可知道 我最后一次见到你
But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you

比你最后一次见到我要近得多
even more recently than you have seen me.

是吗？ 当然
Have you? Yes.

今天早些时候 我清楚地记得
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

你在史塔克大人房里跟他密谈
seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.

你藏在床下了吗？
Was that you under the bed?

之后不久...
And not long after that

我又见你
when I saw you escorting a certain

陪同一位尊贵的外宾...
foreign dignitary...

商谈国事？
Council business?

其实你有狭海对岸的朋友不足为怪
Of course you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.

你自个儿就是打那边来的嘛
You're from there yourself, after all.

我们也是好朋友 对不对 瓦里斯大人？
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

我可一直这么以为
I'd like to think we are.

你可以想象我此刻的心理负担
So you can imagine my burden,

在朋友和国王之间左右为难
wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies.

于私不能出卖朋友
To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

于公却又不能对不起国家...
turning right loyalty to the realm

噢 劳驾 站在这个十字路口上
Oh, please. To find myself in a position

这要让国王得知了只言片语...
where a simple word to the King

你两个在勾兑什么呢？
What are you two conspiring about?

算了 不管怎样 赶紧过来
Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up.

我老哥马上出席
My brother is coming.

出席御前会议？
To a small council meeting?

远方传来了令人不安的消息
Disturbing news from far away.

你没听说吗？
Haven't you heard?

快滚 不准乞讨
Off with you. No begging.

我不是乞丐 我住在这里
I'm not a beggar. I live here.

要我赏你两耳刮子才听得懂？
D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?

我找我父亲
I want to see my father.

我还要搞王后咧
I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.

小子 你要你老爹
You want your father, boy?

去酒馆找去
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,

他一定是喝醉了被伙计们拿来当尿壶使呢
getting pissed on by his friends.

我父亲是是御前首相！
My father is Hand of the King!

我不是小子 我是临冬城的艾莉亚・史塔克
I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell

你要是敢碰我
and if you lay a hand on me, my father

我老爸会把你们两个的头砍下来挂枪上
will have both your heads on spikes.

现在你们是让我过去
Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you

还是要我赏你两耳刮子才听得懂？
on the ear to help with your hearing?

你知不知道我派出一半的卫士去找你？
You know I had half my guard out searching for you?

你答应过我不再捣蛋了
You promised me this would stop.

他们说要杀你
They said they were going to kill you.

谁说的？ 我没看清楚
Who did? I didn't see them,

但我想其中一个是胖子 噢 艾莉亚
but I think one was fat. Oh, Arya.

我没说谎！他们说你找到了私生子
I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard

还说狼和狮很快就会自相残杀 还说野蛮人...
and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage

说野蛮人如何如何
something about the savage.

你在哪里听到这些的？ 在地城里
Where did you hear this? In the dungeons,

巨龙的头骨旁边
near the dragon skulls.

你在地城里做什么？
What were you doing in the dungeons?

抓猫
Chasing a cat.

陛下 抱歉打搅
Pardon, My Lord.

外面有个黑衣弟兄求见
There's a night's watchman here begging a word.

说有要事相告
He says it's urgent.

朋友 你叫什么名字？ 叫我尤伦就好 大人
Your name, friend? Yoren, if it please.

这一定是您的公子 长得跟您真像
This must be your son. He has the look.

我是女生！
I'm a girl!

是班扬派你来的么？
Did Benjen send you?

不 大人
No one sent me, My Lord.

我是来寻找把守长城的人手
I'm here to find men for the Wall,

看看地牢里有没有合适的人渣
see if there's any scum in the dungeons

好收罗去充军
that might be fit for service.

噢 我会为你安排的
Oh, we'll find recruits for you.

谢谢您 大人
Thank you, My Lord.

但这并非我此刻打扰您的原因
But that's not why I disturb you now.

您弟弟班扬流着黑衫军的血
Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black

尤伦
守夜人 “浪鸦”

我和您一样把他当成兄弟
makes him as much my brother as yours.

我正是为了他才飞速赶来
It's for his sake I rode here so hard

差点把我的马给累死了
I damn near killed my horse.

其他人也在往这边赶
There are others riding too.

到明天全城都会知道
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

知道什么？
Know what?

咱们最好私下谈 大人
Best said in private, My Lord.

去吧 我们回头再把话说完
Go on. We'll talk more later.

乔里 带她回房
Jory, take her safely to her room.

小姐 走 你听见你父亲的吩咐了
Come along, My Lady. You heard your father.

乔里・凯索
史塔克家族的侍卫队长

我爸爸有多少侍卫？
How many guards does my father have?

在君临吗？有五十个
Here in King's Landing? 50.

你不会让别人杀他的 对不对？
You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?

不用为这个担心 小姐
No fear on that count, little lady.

怎么回事？ 大人 您夫人...
Well? It's about your wife, My Lord.

她逮捕了小恶魔
She's taken the Imp.

您离家可真远啊 史塔克夫人
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

请阁下通报姓名
To whom do I speak?

在下是谷地的骑士瓦狄斯・伊根爵士
Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

瓦狄斯・伊根
鹰巢城侍卫队长

艾林夫人跟您有约吗？
Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?

我们事先来不及通知
There was no time to send word.

容我冒昧多问一句 夫人
May I ask, My Lady,

他怎么会跟你在一起？
why he is with you?

正是因为他 我们才来不及通知
That's why there was no time.

他是我的俘虏 他看起来可不像个俘虏
He is my prisoner. He doesn't look like a prisoner.

他的命运要交给我妹妹决定
My sister will decide what he looks like.

是 夫人
Yes, My Lady.

就这样办吧
She will at that.

鹰巢城 都说它是攻不破的
The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.

给我十条好汉 几双钉鞋
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes

我铁定干翻这婊子
I'll impregnate the bitch.

我喜欢你
I like you.

史塔克大人 御前会议已经召开
Lord Stark, your presence has been requested

请您不要缺席
in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.

我得先面见国王 单独晋见
I need to see the King firstalone.

国王陛下正在主持御前会议 大人
The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord.

他召您立刻去开会
He has summoned you.

是关于我夫人吗？ 不 大人
Is it about my wife? No, My Lord.

似乎是丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的事
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

那贱货怀孕了
The whore is pregnant.

你这是谋害幼儿啊 这事我早警告过你
You're speaking of murdering a child. I warned you

还在北境的时候我就说过
this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you,

可你不肯听
but you didn't care to hear.

那好 你现在给我听清楚
Well, hear it now.

我要他们死 母子两个一起
I want 'em dead, mother and child both.

外加那个笨蛋韦赛里斯
And that fool Viserys as well.

这样说够明白了吧？
Is that plain enough for you?

我要他们死
I want them both dead.

这事毫无荣誉可言 而你将为此遗臭万年
You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.

荣誉！？
Honor?!

我要统治诺大的七国！
I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule!

一个国王 七大王国！
One King, Seven Kingdoms.

荣誉可能驾驭天下
Do you think honor keeps them in line?

维持统一吗！？
Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace?

是恐惧 恐惧和鲜血！
It's fearfear and blood.

那你和疯王有什么区别？
Then we're no better than the Mad King.

小心 奈德 小心你的嘴
Careful, Ned. Careful now.

因为八爪蜘蛛的捕风捉影
You want to assassinate a girl

你就要暗杀一个小女孩？
because the Spider heard a rumor?

并非捕风捉影 大人 公主怀孕的事不会错的
No rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.

消息来源呢？
Based on whose information?

乔拉・莫尔蒙爵士
Ser Jorah Mormont.

他现下是坦格利安兄妹的亲信
He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.

莫尔蒙？
Mormont?

一个千里之外的叛徒的话也能当真？
You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?

乔拉・莫尔蒙虽然贩卖奴隶 却不是叛徒
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.

当然 对一个重荣誉的人而言 这两者没什么区别
Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.

他触犯律法 背叛家族 是戴罪之身
He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.

我们岂能根据他的一面之辞去害人？
We commit murder on the word of this man?

万一他是对的呢？
And if he's right?

万一她的确怀了个儿子？
If she has a son?

万一坦格利安的孽种 带着多斯拉克大军杀回来
A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army...

你怎么说？ 狭海依旧隔在中间
What then? The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

等多斯拉克人教会他们的马
I'll fear the Dothraki

在水上走路那一天 我才会担心
the day they teach their horses to run on water.

什么也别做
Do nothing?

这就是你睿智的谏言吗？
That's your wise advice?

干等敌人登岸了再说？
Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?

你们是我的重臣 快发表意见！
You're my council. Counsel!

跟这满脑子荣誉的傻瓜讲讲道理
Speak sense to this honorable fool.

大人 凭良心说 我真的能体会您的顾虑
I understand your misgivings, My Lord.

我们考虑的是件可怕的事
Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing

卑鄙的事
we must consider, a vile thing.

可我们这些冒昧为政的人
Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes

凡事必须以全国百姓福祉为优先考量
do vile things for the good of the realm.

若是天上诸神给丹妮莉丝一个儿子
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son,

王国就难免血光之灾
the realm will bleed.

我对这个女孩没有恶感
I bear this girl no ill will,

但若多斯拉克人大举入侵
but should the Dothraki invade,

会有多少无辜百姓死于非命？
how many innocents will die?

派席尔
大学士

多少城镇被付之一炬？
How many towns will burn?

倘若死了她一个
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

能拯救万千生灵
that she should die now

会不会是比较明智 甚或比较仁慈的作法呢？
so that tens of thousands might live?

他们兄妹早就该杀
We should have had them both killed years ago.

若你发现跟自己上床的原来是个丑女
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman,

最好闭上眼睛 赶紧办事
best close your eyes, get it over with.

割了她喉咙 翻过这一页
Cut her throat. Be done with it.

这辈子我两次追随你上战场
I followed you into war

出生入死
twice,

没有二话
without doubts,

没有犹豫
without second thoughts.

但这次不行
But I will not follow you now.

跟我一起长大的劳勃
The Robert I grew up with

决不会在一个未出生的孩子的影子下颤抖
didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.

她必须死
She dies.

我决不当谋杀共犯
I will have no part in it.

史塔克大人 你是御前首相
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

你要么照我说的去做 不然我就另请高明
You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.

那我祝他好运
And good luck to him.

我以为你不是这种人
I thought you were a better man.

给我滚！你这该死的家伙
Out. Out, damn you.

我受够你了
I'm done with you.

滚 滚回临冬城去
Go, run back to Winterfell!

否则我一定把你的头砍下来挂在枪上
I'll have your head on a spike!

我还要亲自动手 蠢货！
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

你以为你了不起 天下只有你知道爱惜荣誉！
You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable?

这是战争懂不懂！
This is a war!

我要带女儿们提前动身
I'll go ahead with my daughters.

去让她们做好准备 你亲自去
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

不要找人帮忙 是 陛下
Don't ask anyone for help. Right away, My Lord.

贝里席大人求见
Lord Baelish is here for you.

今早上你走之后
His Grace went on about you at some length

陛下接着骂了一通
after you took your leave.

话中可是出现了“叛国”字眼哟
The word "treason" was mentioned.

你究竟来干什么？
What can I do for you?

您打算何时回临冬城？
When do you return to Winterfell?

怎么？这与你何干？
Why? What do you care?

傍晚时您若还留在城里
If you're still here come nightfall,

我便带您去见琼恩・艾林病倒前
I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn

探访过的最后一人
spoke with before falling ill.

如果您对此还感兴趣的话
If that sort of thing still interests you.

我没时间了
I don't have the time.

随您的便 花不了一小时的
It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.

集合所有卫士
Round up all the men we have

在我女儿房外严密设防
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

你手头最厉害的是谁？ 韦尔跟海华
Who are your best two swords? Heward and Wyl.

叫他们在马厩等我
Find them and meet me at the stables.

你未经许可就把他带来这里
You bring him here without permission?

让他玷污我的门楣
You pollute my home with his presence?

莱莎・徒利
凯特琳・徒利之妹 琼恩・艾林之妻

罗宾 你姨妈干了件坏事
Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin,

很坏的事
a very bad thing.

你还记得她 对吗？
You remember her, don't you?

他漂不漂亮？
Isn't he beautiful?

他也很强壮 琼恩很清楚
And strong too. Jon knew it.

他的遗言就是“种性强韧”
His last words were "the seed is strong."

他要大家都知道
He wanted everyone to know

他儿子长大之后会变成个强壮的男子汉
what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.

你看 他现在是谷地之主
Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.

莱莎
Lysa,

是你写信说起兰尼斯特的事
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

警告我... 警告你离他们远点！
warning meTo stay away from them!

不是叫你抓一个过来！
Not to bring one here!

妈咪？
Mommy?

他是坏人吗？ 他是
Is that the bad man? It is.

罗宾・艾林
琼恩・艾林之子

他好小一点喔
He's little.

他是兰尼斯特家的小恶魔提利昂
He's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister.

谋害你父亲的就是他
He killed your father.

他害死了国王的首相！
He murdered the Hand of the King!

哦 原来他也是我杀的？
Oh, did I kill him too?

我还挺忙的
I've been a very busy man.

管紧你那张碎嘴！
You will watch your tongue!

这些都是谷地的骑士
These men are knights of the Vale.

个个对琼恩・艾林敬爱有加
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

个个都愿意为我牺牲性命
Every one of them would die for me.

我要有什么不测
If any harm comes to me,

我老哥詹姆绝对很乐意料理他们
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

你不能对我们怎样！
You can't hurt us.

没有人敢在这里乱来！妈咪 你告诉他！
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, mommy!

你快告诉他！ 嘘 嘘 嘘 小宝贝
Tell him! Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.

他只是虚张声势
He's just trying to frighten us.

兰尼斯特家的人通通是骗子
Lannisters are all liars.

谁也别想欺负我的小亲亲
No one will hurt my baby.

妈咪...
Mommy...

我想看坏人飞
I want to see the bad man fly.

或许可以哦 小亲亲
Perhaps you will, my little love.

他是我的犯人
This man is my prisoner.

请不要伤害他！
I will not have him harmed.

瓦狄斯爵士
Ser Vardis,

我姐姐的客人累了
my sister's guest is weary.

带他去“下面”休息休息
Take him down below so he can rest.

把他交给莫德
Introduce him to Mord.

睡吧 小矮人
You go sleep, dwarf man.

睡个好觉 小矮人儿！
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

史塔克公爵能保住脑袋真是万幸
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

劳勃会发几天火 但什么也不会做
Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything.

他们是过命的交情
He adores the man.

你很嫉妒嘛
You're jealous.

这安全吗 你确定？
Are you sure this won't hurt?

除非我失手
Only if I slip.

你喜欢我这个样子？
And you'd prefer me like this?

如果你喜欢没毛的 干嘛不找个小男孩
If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.

我要的是你
I want you.

蓝礼・拜拉席恩
风息堡公爵 国王幼弟

在我老哥眼中 没上过战场的都不算男人
My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

他始终把我当成被宠坏的孩子
He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child.

噢 你不这样看吗？
Oh, and you're not?

洛拉斯・提利尔 风光的百花骑士
Loras Tyrell, the knight of the flowers?

你打过多少仗了？
How many wars have you fought in?

你那套铠甲花了你爹多少钱？
Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?

别动
Hold still.

劳勃和史坦尼斯只会唠叨我如何软弱
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,

如何见了血就怕
how I squirm at the sight of blood

团队比武中那小子的眼睛被打掉时 你确实吐了
you did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.

天哪！他眼睛就在眼眶外头晃荡！
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!

没功夫就别上场呗
He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.

你说得轻巧
Easy for you to say.

并非每个人都跟你一样是天才
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

我不是天才 没有谁天生会使剑
It's not a gift. No one gave it to me.

我厉害是出于勤奋
I'm good because I work at it

自能握木棍起 我天天练习
every day of my life since I could hold a stick.

我也练过啊 我觉得就算我没日没夜地练
I could work at fighting all day, every day,

也不可能赶上你
and still never be as good as you.

是吗 说不定你能行呢
Yes well, I guess we'll never know.

全剃光？ 全剃光
Everywhere? Everywhere.

会议的最终结果是？
So how did it end up?

坦格利安女孩必须死？
The Targaryen girl will die?

是的 虽然这令人嫌恶
It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

劳勃在这事上寸步不让
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

每当谈及这个女孩
Every time he talks about killing her,

我敢说桌子都被他的怒气掀起了六寸
I swear the table rises six inches.

可惜他对自己老婆没这么大热情
It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.

他对她的钱可是热衷不已
He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money.

这帮兰尼斯特真是让人不服不行
You have to give it to the Lannisters

一方面他们傲慢乏味的程度无人可比
they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts

恐怕连诸神都难以忍受
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

另一方面又的确富可敌国
but they do have outrageous amounts of money.

我们家也很富裕
I have an outrageous amount of money.

不及兰尼斯特
Not as much as the Lannisters.

但比你有钱啊
But a lot more than you.

劳勃又叫嚣说要带我去打猎
Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.

上次一去就是两星期
Last time we were out there for two weeks.

每天都淋着雨 在森林里跋涉
Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day,

就为了陪他玩叉肉游戏
all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.

噢 劳勃就知道杀杀杀
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

反正他是国王他说了算
And he's the King.

他怎会当上国王呢？ 别人打不过他呗
How did that ever happen? Because he loves his killing.

他从小就是万人敌
And he used to be good at it.

你知道谁才该称王吗？
Do you know who should be king?

别开玩笑 我没开玩笑
Be serious. I am.

我父亲可以做你的后盾
My father could be your bank.

我没真正上过战场 但我愿意为你而战
I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.

我在继承顺位上排老四
I'm fourth in line.

劳勃当初在继承顺位上排老几？
And where was Robert in the line of royal succession?

乔佛里是个怪物
Joffrey is a monster.

托曼才八岁 史坦尼斯？
Tommen is eight. Stannis?

史坦尼斯比龙虾更无趣
Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

可他毕竟是我哥
He's still my older brother.

你干什么？！ 看 看哪
What are you doing?! Look at it.

你割伤了我
You cut me.

一点血而已 我们体内有很多
It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

生活中免不了见点血
Sometimes a little spills.

你要当国王就得见很多很多血
If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this.

你必须习惯它
You need to get used to it.

来 看哪
Go on. Look.

大家爱戴你
People love you.

愿意为你服务 因为你仁慈慷慨
They love to serve you because you're kind to them.

每个人都想接近你
They want to be near you.

你厌恶杀戮
You're willing to do what needs to be done,

但你懂得去做必须做的事
but you don't gloat over it.

且不为此沾沾自喜
You don't love killing.

有本书上说
Where is it written that power

权力是万恶之源
is the sole province of the worst?

王位是给那些
That thrones are only made

遭人憎恨 让人恐惧的人坐的
for the hated and the feared?

但你不一样 你会成为绝代明君
You would be a wonderful King.

很遗憾你与奈德・史塔克的婚姻如此短命
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.

你们看上去挺般配的
You seemed so good together.

我总算做了件让你称心如意的事
I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.

国家没有首相 很快就会乱套
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.

我猜你是来劝我把职位
I suppose this is where you tell me

交给你弟弟詹姆罢
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

不
No.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
王后

他办事太儿戏了
He's not serious enough.

如果说奈德・史塔克有什么好处
I'll say this for Ned Stark:

就是他办事决不儿戏
He's serious enough.

这样赶走他？值得吗？
Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?

我不知道
I don't know.

我只知道
But I do know this:

如果坦格利安女孩能说服她那马王丈夫出兵
If the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade

如果多斯拉克人渡过狭海...
and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea...

我们将难以抵御
We won't be able to stop them.

孩童皆知多斯拉克人不懂航海
The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that.

他们没有纪律 没有盔甲
They don't have discipline. They don't have armor.

也没有攻城器械
They don't have siege weapons.

你是你父亲的传声筒
It's a neat little trick you do:

这些都是他的看法
You move your lips and your father's voice comes out.

我父亲说错了吗？
Is my father wrong?

假设韦赛里斯・坦格利安
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

带着四万多斯拉克哮吼武士登陆
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

我们只能退守城堡
We hole up in our castles

因为这是明智之举
a wise moveonly a fool

蠢货才会跟多斯拉克人在野外交战
would meet the Dothraki in an open field.

他们攻不下我们的城堡
They leave us in our castles.

但可以洗劫焚烧我们的村镇
They go from town to town, looting and burning,

杀死所有无法躲进石墙背后的人
killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall,

我们的粮食和牲畜被抢光了
stealing all our crops and livestock,

女人和孩子成为奴隶
enslaving all our women and children.

试问七大王国的子民会支持
How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

躲在高墙后面
their absentee King, their cowardly King

对他们不闻不问的懦夫国王吗？
hiding behind high walls?

他们用不了多久就会认定
When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen

韦赛里斯・坦格利安才是真正的国王！
is the rightful monarch after all?

可我们拥有数量优势
We still outnumber them.

告诉我 五和一 哪个大？
Which is the bigger number: Five or one?

当然是五
Five.

五...
Five...

和一
One.

一支团结一心的军队
One armya real army

为一个共同的目标奋战
united behind one leader with one purpose.

而我们的目标却随着疯王之死不复存在了
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

现在我们不过是
Now we've got as many armies

由一群同床异梦的家伙组成的乌合之众
as there are men with gold in their purse.

每个人都打着自己的算盘
And everybody wants something different.

你老爸想操控全世界
Your father wants to own the world.

奈德・史塔克想逃回家 埋进雪地里不闻世事
Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.

那你想要什么？
What do you want?

王国九年没打仗了
We haven't had a real fight in nine years.

相互背后捅刀子算不上真的打仗
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.

这个龌龊的国家
And that's all the realm is now:

这个属于小人 阴谋家
Backstabbing and scheming

财迷和马屁精的国家
and arselicking and moneygrubbing.

有时候我很惊讶它还没有四分五裂
Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.

那是因为我们的婚姻
Our marriage.

啊 我们就这样
Ah, so here we sit

为王国安泰
17 years later,

熬了十七年
holding it all together.

你不觉得累吗？
Don't you get tired?

我每天都累
Every day.

在仇恨煎熬中度过
How long can hate hold a thing together?

一晃整整十七年
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

的确如此
Yes, it is.

的确如此
Yes, it is.

她什么模样？
What was she like?

你没问过她的情况 从没有
You've never asked about her, not once.

为什么现在要问？
Why not?

一开始 我觉得哪怕只提到她的名字
At first, just saying her name even in private

哪怕是悄悄地提 就又唤回了她
felt like I was breathing life back into her.

我以为只要不提她
I thought if I didn't talk about her,

终究能将她从你心底抹去
she'd just fade away for you.

当这一点愿望落空之后
When I realized that wasn't going to happen,

我是出于愤恨而不愿追问
I refused to ask out of spite.

我不愿成全你
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction

不愿让你知道我对你有一丝一毫的关心
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

到最后连我的愤恨也与你无关了
And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

我发现你甚至还享受着我恨你这件事
As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.

那你为什么现在要问？
So why now?

因为莱安娜・史塔克的幽灵对我们造成的伤害
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us

怎可能比我们之前上百次互相伤害的更深？
that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?

你想知道丑陋的真相吗？
You want to know the horrible truth?

真相是我连她长什么样都不记得了
I can't even remember what she looked like.

我只知道她是我这辈子深爱的女人...
I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted...

却被人从我身边抢走
Someone took her away from me,

七大王国加在一起也无法填满我心中的空洞
and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

知道吗 我对你有过感情
I felt something for you once, you know?

我知道
I know.

即便失去第一个孩子以后
Even after we lost our first boy.

我仍然倾心于你 很长时间
For quite a while, actually.

我们之间就真的没可能？
Was it ever possible for us?

你就没有一瞬间 一刹那对我有过感觉？
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

没有
No.

你不想说点什么？
Does that make you feel better or worse?

我无话可说
It doesn't make me feel anything.

大人 她跟他真像 不是吗？
She looks like him, don't she, My Lord?

她有他的鼻子 他的黑发
She has his nose, his black hair.

的确
Aye.

大人 您见到他的时候...
Tell him when you see him, My Lord.

请您告诉他 她有多漂亮
If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.

我会的
I will.

请告诉他我没跟过其他人
And tell him I've been with no one else.

大人 我以新旧诸神之名起誓
I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new.

我不要金银珠宝
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

只要他的人
just him.

国王对我一直很好
The King was always good to me.

琼恩・艾林来找你
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

所为何事？
what did he want?

他不是来寻欢作乐的 大人
He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord.

他只是来看看孩子是否过得好
He just wanted to know if the child was happy,

是否健康
healthy.

她看来很健康
He looks healthy enough to me.

将来我们会关照她的
The girl shall want for nothing.

梅q
妓女

我发现买妓院比买船
Brothels make a much better investment than ships,

来得稳当
I've found.

因为妓女不会沉哪
Whores rarely sink.

你对劳勃国王的私生子女所知多少？
What do you know of King Robert's bastards?

这个嘛 从简单的说起 他生得比你多
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

多多少 有关系吗？
How many Does it matter?

只要睡过的女人够多 总有人会送你大礼
If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.

琼恩・艾林把他们都找出来了 这又是为什么？
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?

他是御前首相 想必劳勃要他代为照顾
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

国王是被父爱的光环笼罩了
He was overcome with fatherly love.

走吧
Come.

乔里！ 大人
Jory! My Lord.

小小一群狼
Such a small pack of wolves.

休得无礼 爵士 这可是国王的首相
Stay back, Ser. This is the Hand of the King.

国王的前任首相
Was the Hand of the King.

现在嘛 不知他算老几
Now I'm not sure what he is

好象是某个偏远地方的领主
lord of somewhere very far away.

兰尼斯特 你这是什么意思？
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

为你安全着想 赶紧躲进去
Get back inside where it's safe.

我在找我老弟
I'm looking for my brother.

史塔克大人 您还记得我弟弟吧？
You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark?

金头发 舌头利 个子矮
Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.

我记得非常清楚
I remember him well.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 王后的孪生弟弟 “弑君者”

他似乎在路上碰到点麻烦
It seems he had some trouble on the road.

您该不会正巧知道是怎么回事吧？
You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?

他是在我的命令下遭到逮捕
He was taken at my command

以为其罪行负责
to answer for his crimes.

两位大人！
My lords!

我这就去找都城守备队
I'll bring the city watch.

拔剑罢 史塔克
Come, Stark.

我宁愿你死的时候手里拿着武器
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

你敢再威胁我家陛下... 威胁？
If you threaten My Lord againThreaten?

“我打算把你家陛下从脑袋到卵蛋劈成两半”
As in, "I'm going to open your lord

“看看史塔克到底是什么做的”
from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of"?

杀了我
You kill me,

你弟弟也性命难保
your brother's a dead man.

说得对
You're right.

不许伤他...把他手下给我全宰了！
Take him alive. Kill his men.

我弟弟 史塔克大人...
My brother, Lord Stark

我们要你放人
we want him back.
