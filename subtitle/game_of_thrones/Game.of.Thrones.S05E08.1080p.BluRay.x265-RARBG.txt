第五季第八集   Hardhome
艰难屯

陛下 我想说的是
Your Grace, I want to say

你不要说话
You will not speak.

我怎么确定你就是提利昂・兰尼斯特？
How do I know you are who you say you are?

我还能是谁
If only I were otherwise.

如果你就是提利昂・兰尼斯特 我就应该杀了你
If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you

这是你的家族对我的家族的补偿
to pay your family back for what it did to mine?

你想向兰尼斯特家族复仇吗？
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

我的妈妈乔安娜・兰尼斯特
I killed my mother Joanna Lannister

因为生我而死
on the day I was born.

我用一把十字弓 杀了我爸爸泰温・兰尼斯特
I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart.

这个时代我是当仁不让的兰尼斯特克星
I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

那我是不是应该因为你杀了自己的家人
So I should welcome you into my service

而把你招入我的麾下？
because you murdered members of your own family?

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔” 被通缉的贵族

乔拉・莫尔蒙
“大熊” 被放逐的骑士

招入您的麾下？
Into your service?

陛下 我们才刚刚见面
Your Grace, we have only just met.

还不能确定你是不是值得我为你效劳啊
It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.

你要是想回角斗场也行
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生” 弥林的女王

弥桑黛
丹妮的侍女

马上就送你回去
just say the word.

我还年轻的时候 听到过一个故事
When I was a young man, I heard a story

说在有史以来最恶劣的风暴中 有个婴儿降生
about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory.

她没财产 没土地 没军队
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,

只有一个高贵的姓氏和屈指可数的几名追随者
only a name and a handful of supporters,

而且那些追随者大多是想用她的名号来捞上一笔
most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves.

她常有性命之虞 追随者带着她东躲西藏
They kept her alive, moving her from place to place,

往往前脚刚走 后脚来杀她的刺客就到了
often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

她最后被卖给了世界尽头的一个什么部落首领
She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world

故事到这里看起来差不多要结束了
and that appeared to be that.

然而好些年过去了
And then a few years later,

世上最消息灵通的那个人告诉我
the most wellinformed person I knew

那个财产 土地 军队一无所有的女孩
told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies

没过多久便拥有了这三样东西
had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time,

再加上三条龙
along with three dragons.

那人说 她是当今最有机会
He thought she was our best,

也是最后一个能改天换地的人
last chance to build a better world.

我以为您至少值得一见
I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.

那你又为什么值得我一见？
And why are you worth meeting?

我又为什么要花时间听你讲呢？
Why should I spend my time listening to you?

因为您仅凭自己无法改天换地
Because you cannot build a better world on your own.

您身边没有人知道应该怎样统治维斯特洛
You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule.

各大家族的优势和弱点
The strengths and weaknesses of the houses

他们是敌是友
that will either join or oppose you.

我将得到一支大军
I will have a very large army

还有身躯庞大的魔龙
and very large dragons.

杀戮与政治不尽相同
Killing and politics aren't always the same thing.

我当国王之手的时候
When I served as Hand of the King,

国王醉心于虐待动物更甚于关心他的臣民
I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question

治国理政全凭我一人之力
preferred torturing animals to leading his people.

若您真能名副其实
I could do an even better job

我为一名称职的统治者出谋划策
advising a ruler worth the name.

还能表现得更好
If that is indeed what you are.

所以你想做我的顾问？
So you want to advise me?

那好
Very well.

你认为我该如何处置他？
What would you have me do with him?

我发过誓 他胆敢回来我就处死他
I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

我知道
I know.

女王言而无信 何以取信于人民呢？
Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?

无论乔拉爵士在出卖您的消息时是何许人也
Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you,

他已经痛改前非了
he is no longer that man.

我从没见过有人能像他侍奉您一样
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man

那么忠心耿耿 至死不渝
as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.

他说 他将为您而战 为您而死
He claims he would kill for you and die for you

我的所见所闻让我对他毫不怀疑
and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him.

然而他的确背叛过您
And yet he did betray you.

他是否有过机会向您自首？
Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?

有过
Yes.

很多次机会
Many opportunities.

那他坦白了吗？
And did he?

没有 他是被逼之下不得不招认的
No, not until forced to do so.

他崇拜您
He worships you.

我想他还爱上了您
He is in love with you, I think.

但他不相信您能接受那个事实
But he did not trust you with the truth.

那事实对您很重要
An unpleasant truth to be sure,

但无疑也令人不快
but one of great significance to you.

他不相信 他说出口之后您能原谅他
He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.

那我应该杀了他？
So I should kill him?

杀忠臣者
A ruler who kills those devoted to her

将无人为之效忠
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

而您需要人效忠
And you're going to need to inspire devotion,

如果您要统治维斯特洛的话 还需要很多人的效忠
a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea.

然而您不能让他在您左右
But you cannot have him by your side when you do.

将乔拉爵士逐出弥林
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

乌尼亚
修女

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
太后

认罪

艾莉亚・史塔克
黑白之院学徒

我叫拉娜 是个孤儿
My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

我八岁的时候 讨到了足够的钱
When I was eight, I begged enough money

买了第一篮牡蛎
to buy my first bucket of oysters.

贾坤・赫加尔
无面者

然后我卖了那篮牡蛎 挣到的钱再买了两篮
I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more.

过了一段时间 我攒够了钱
It took a while, but I finally saved enough

买了一辆手推车来卖牡蛎
to buy myself an oyster cart.

现在
Now every morning,

每天早上我都会去运河边
I make my way down to the canals.

经过鱼贩和面包师的铺子
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

我通常会看见劳拉
I usually see Lhara,

她回家的时候会买我的牡蛎 每天都是第一个买
my first customer of the day on her way home.

然后我左转进入月咏者巷… 
Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane

左转进入旧货巷
Turn left onto Ragman Lane

我的大部分买卖都在那里做
where I do most of my trade.

拉娜令人印象深刻
Lanna is very impressive.

非常勤奋
Very industrious.

她会成为千面之神的好仆人
She will make a fine servant for the ManyFaced God.

她将如何侍奉千面之神？
How will she serve him?

她将不再左转去旧货巷
She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane.

她会右转 去旧货码头
She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

她要在那里做什么？
What will she do there?

她会看到的
She will see.

看到什么？
See what?

某人怎么会知道？
How can a man tell a girl this?

如果某人知道女孩将会看到什么
If he knew what she would see,

女孩就不需要去了
there would be no reason to send her.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝！
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝！
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝！
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

你的牡蛎新鲜吗？
Your oysters fresh?

是这城里最好的
Best in the city.

你不会骗老人家吧？
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

嗯
Mm.

很好 给我来四个 再加点醋
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

这是我第十八次出海
It's my 18th voyage.

每次我都平安归来 毫发无伤
Returned from all of them without a scratch on me.

不行
Can't do it.

求你了 我有三个孩子
Please, I've three children.

没有我的话
Without me...

这是钱 您拿着 求您了
Here, take it. You have to.

我有三个孩子
I've three children.

他们怎么办？ 快走吧
What will they do? Come on.

他们只有我了
They've nothing without me.

求您了！ 求您了！
Please, you have to!

求您了 你不了解！
Please, you don't understand!

求求您！
Please!

这人是个赌徒
The man is a gambler.

他赌的是船
He wages that a sailor's ship

赌船只能不能平安到达目的地
will make it to its destination.

对船长来说这个赌很奇特
It is a strange wager for the captain.

他们只有丢了性命才会赢得赌局
He only wins if he loses his life.

那为什么一开始船长要打这个赌呢
So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?

女孩告诉某人她见到的
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

如果船长死了
If the captain dies,

这个瘦瘦的人就会付给船长的家人很多钱
the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

可如果赌徒输掉了赌局
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet

最后却决定不付钱
and decides he does not have to pay after all.

如果他执意如此
A destitute woman and her small child,

那些无依无靠的女人和孩子又能怎么办呢？
what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself?

她们能向谁求助？
To whom can they turn for recourse?

千面之神
The ManyFaced God.

你说过你不知道我在码头会看见什么
You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.

某人不知道女孩在码头会看见或看不见什么
A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not.

名叫拉娜的女孩会回到码头
A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.

她会继续观察这个赌徒
She will watch the gambler.

直到对他像对自己一样了如指掌
She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.

然后呢？
And then what?

给这瘦瘦的人一个礼物
A gift for the thin man.

她还没准备好
She's not ready.

她可能还没准备好 也可能准备好了
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

假如她没有呢？
And if she's not?

对千面之神来说都一样
It is all the same to the ManyFaced God.

科本
被剥夺项链的学士

审判很快会举行
The trial will take place soon.

大麻雀会提出
The High Sparrow will be presenting

大量针对您的指控
a substantial case against you.

罪名呢？
The charges?

通奸 叛国 乱伦
Fornication, treason, incest,

谋害劳勃国王
the murder of King Robert.

全都是谎言
All lies.

当然 陛下
Of course, Your Grace.

我担心的是教会并不像世俗王权那样
My concern is that the Faith does not adhere

凡事讲求证据
to the same standards of proof as the crown.

恕我直言
I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,

常常是教会想让谁死 谁就得死
but belief is so often the death of reason.

我倒是希望你早点说出来
I wish you had said it sooner.

有詹姆的消息吗？
Is there any word from Jaime?

没有 恐怕还没有
No, I'm afraid not.

陛下 派席尔大学士
Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle

已将您叔叔凯冯
has summoned your Uncle Kevan

从凯岩城召来
back from Casterly Rock

出任国王之手一职
to serve as Hand of the King.

他现在主持御前会议
He now presides over the small council.

告诉他 我有话要跟他说
Tell him I need to speak to him.

我恳请他来看您 但是他不肯
I implored him to visit you, but he would not.

那我儿子呢？国王呢？
What about my son, the king?

如果你能来探视我 那国王必然也能… 
If you can visit me, then surely the king...

您被监禁 玛格丽皇后也被监禁
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest,

国王还无法接受这一切
the king has not taken them well.

他把自己关在房间里
He remains in his chambers.

仆人们常常发现送去的食物丝毫未动
His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched.

你必须跟他说
You need to talk to him.

你必须告诉我儿子来见我
You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me,

来见他的母亲
come and see his mother.

他…  我试过了 陛下
HeI tried, Your Grace.

他不见我 他谁都不见
He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone.

我不能待在这儿
I can't stay here.

倒是有个办法 陛下
There is a way, Your Grace.

能离开这儿
A way out.

认罪？
Confess?

向“大麻雀”认罪？
To the High Sparrow?

不可能
I won't.

我造就了他
I made him.

我亲手提拔的他
I rose him up from nothing.

我不会向某个光着脚的贱民下跪
I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner

乞求他的饶恕
and beg his forgiveness.

再见 陛下
Goodbye, my queen.

那项工作还在继续
The work continues.

“臭佬”
席恩・葛雷乔伊

珊莎・史塔克
拉姆斯・波顿的妻子

为什么？
Why?

为什么 席恩？
Why, Theon?

我不是席恩 世上已没有席恩
I'm not Theon. There is no Theon.

我是臭佬 臭佬
Reek. Reek.

你为什么要告诉他 臭佬？
Why did you tell him, Reek?

我是在帮你
I was helping you.

你想要逃跑
You wanted to escape.

你不可能逃跑
There is no escape.

永远都不可能
Not ever.

席恩・葛雷乔伊试图逃跑
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

主人知道了
The master knew.

主人什么都知道
He knows everything.

主人追捕他 抓住了他
He hunted him and caught him

把他捆在十字架上
and strapped him to a cross

然后一片一片剥他的皮
and cut away piece after piece

直到再没有席恩这个人
until there was no Theon left.

很好
Good.

要不是因为你 我也不会家破人亡
If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family.

如果我能像拉姆斯一样
If I could do what Ramsay did to you

此时此地 我一样会剥你的皮
right here, right now, I would.

我罪有应得
I deserved everything.

我活该成为臭佬
I deserve to be Reek.

我罪孽深重
I did terrible things.

背叛了罗柏
Turned on Robb.

偷袭了临冬城
Captured Winterfell.

杀死了那两个孩子 他们不只是“那两个孩子”
Killed those boys. They weren't "those boys."

他们是布兰和瑞肯 是你的弟弟
They were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers.

从他们出生开始你就认识他们
You've known them since they were born.

他们不是 他们只是… 
They weren't. They were only

只是什么？
Only what?

我不能说  告诉我
I can't. Tell me.

我不能说 除非主人允许
I can't, not unless the master says.

告诉我 他们不是什么？ 他们不是―
Tell me. They weren't what? They weren't

告诉我为什么布兰和瑞肯就该死
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone

而你却还活着
while you still breathe the air.

看着我的脸 席恩
Tell me to my face, Theon.

告诉我他们不是你的兄弟
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

他们不是布兰和瑞肯！
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

我找不到他们
I couldn't find them.

那只是两个农家男孩
It was two farm boys.

我杀了他们 烧了他们的尸体 这样就没人能看出来
I killed them and burned them so no one would know.

你没杀他们？
You didn't?

你知道他们去哪儿了吗 布兰和瑞肯？
Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?

我不能再说了
I can't talk to you anymore.

席恩 你必须告诉我 你是否知道他们… 
Theon, you have to tell me. Do you have any idea where

我不是席恩！是臭佬！
Not Theon! Reek!

我们的斥候回报 他的兵力约有六千人
Our scouts tell us he's got no more than 6,000 men.

但一半以上都是骑兵
More than half of those are mounted, however.

那史坦尼斯的马能蹦多高？
And how high do Stannis's horses jump?

我们的城墙已经全面整修过了
Our walls have been fully repaired.

城门也已加固
The gates have been reinforced.

我们的粮草足够支撑六个月
We have enough food for six months.

这场围城战我们比他们更有胜算
We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be.

我们要做的就是等他们冻死
All we have to do is wait for them to freeze,

饿死 哗变
starve, and mutiny.

拉姆斯・波顿
卢斯・波顿的私生子

卢斯・波顿
北境守护

你不同意？
You disagree?

史坦尼斯不是北境人
Stannis isn't from the North.

而你是 父亲
You are, Father.

我认为你错过了让人们好好瞧瞧的机会
I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North

瞧瞧北境 瞧瞧波顿家族 是如何惩罚南方入侵者的
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

那你建议如何？
And what do you recommend?

我们不应该在这干坐着
That we not sit and wait for Stannis

把战局的主动权拱手让给史坦尼斯
to decide what sort of fight this is going to be.

我们应该先发制人 迎头痛击
That we hit first and hit hard

让他们成为群鸦的盛宴
and leave a feast for the crows.

一个聪明的指挥官不会白白放弃防守优势
A smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage.

只要我们待在城墙后面
As long as we stay behind these walls,

他们就伤不到我们分毫
they can't touch us.

更何况积雪这么深
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

即使我们想要与之一战
we couldn't get an army through to engage them

也无法派出军队
even if we wanted to.

我不需要一支军队
I don't need an army.

只要二十个好手
I need 20 good men.

那么 你想好了吗？
So, have you decided yet?

我是否值得你效命？
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

你想好是否要杀我了吗？
Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?

杀你大概是最稳妥的选项
It's probably my safest option.

我明白你为何这么想
I can see why you would think so.

要是你父亲的话也会做同样的选择
It's what your father would have done.

那你父亲又会如何选择呢？
And what would your father have done?

我父亲
My father,

那个当众判我死刑的父亲？
who publically sentenced me to death?

我敢说他一门心思要置我于死地
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.

你因此杀了他吗？
Is that why you killed him?

等你哪天决定饶我性命
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

我就把杀死父亲的来龙去脉讲个清楚
I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.

而那一天 如果会有那一天的话
And on that day, should it ever come,

我还得多喝两杯
we'll need more wine than this.

我知道我父亲是什么人
I know what my father was.

知道他做了什么
What he did.

我知道“疯王”并非构陷之辞
I know the Mad King earned his name.

所以 这就是我们
So, here we sit.

两个可怕父亲的两个可怕孩子
Two terrible children of two terrible fathers.

我很可怕吗？
I'm terrible?

我听说了不少事
I've heard stories.

那你为何要跑到天涯海角来见这么个可怕的人？
Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible?

来看看你是不是那种正确的可怕 那是哪一种？
To see if you were the right kind of terrible. Which kind is that?

不让你的臣民变的更加可怕的那种
The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.

嗯 我确实重启了竞技场
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

在我的统治之下 谋杀再一次成为娱乐项目
Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment.

没错 那是明智的
Yes, that was wise.

你还同意嫁给某个你特别厌恶的人
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good.

令人钦佩
Very impressive.

我姐姐也嫁给了个她十分厌恶的人
My own sister married someone she loathed as well,

不过那并非她自己的选择
though not by choice and certainly not

更非为了什么崇高目的 诸神在上
for the greater good, gods forbid.

她最后把他杀了
She ended up having him killed.

但愿事不致此
Perhaps it won't come to that.

到头来 瓦里斯可能真的没有看错你
It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.

瓦里斯？ 劳勃国王的情报大臣？
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

没错 就是他说服我来投奔你的
Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you.

一路上我们二人同行
He was my travelling companion

直到乔拉爵士把我抓住
before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

乔拉出卖我的情报给瓦里斯
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

二十年来八爪蜘蛛到处打探 要置我于死地
For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

他是为了生存而为之
He did what he had to do to survive.

他同时也做了很多其他的事 很多他没有必要做的事
He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do.

我猜正因为他的关系你才免于被杀死在襁褓之中
I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

而你相信他？
But you trust him?

是的 很奇怪
Yes, oddly.

他也许是我唯一信任的人
He may be the only person in the world I trust.

除了我哥哥之外
Except my brother.

你那个杀死了我父亲的哥哥？
The brother who killed my father?

就是那个
That's the one.

或许我还该杀了你
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

身为女王你自然有这个权力
Your queenly prerogative.

我早就不想活喽
I had given up on life

直到瓦里斯让我觉得您还算个盼头
until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for.

要是您砍了我脑袋 嗯嗯
If you chop off my head, well,

我临死前那几天过得可就太有意思了
my final days were interesting.

我不打算杀你
I'm not going to kill you.

哦？那就驱逐我？
No? Banish me?

不
No.

这么说来您既不杀我
So if I'm not going to be murdered

也不驱逐我… 
and I'm not going to be banished

你可以为我谏言
You're going to advise me.

前提是别醉得说胡话
While you can still speak in complete sentences.

谏言什么呢？
Advise you on what?

如何得到我想要的
How to get what I want.

铁王座
The Iron Throne.

或许您该要点别的
Perhaps you should try wanting something else.

要想听笑话 我会找个称职的弄臣
If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.

那不光是句玩笑话
I'm not entirely joking.

世界很大 并非只有维斯特洛
There's more to the world than Westeros after all.

在这里您让多少人日子更好过了？几百？几千？
How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here?

也许您就属于这里
Perhaps this is where you belong,

在这能发挥最大的作用
where you can do the most good.

我希望奴隶湾出生的每个孩子
I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay

都不再体验被买来卖去是什么滋味
would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold.

无论身在何处 我都会继续为之奋斗
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

但我的故乡不在这
But this is not my home.

若重回故土 谁会支持您？
When you get back to your home, who supports you?

平民百姓
The common people.

那就姑且如此吧
Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen.

在奴隶湾 平民百姓是您的后盾
Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people

却也是唯一的后盾
and only the common people.

这感觉如何？撇开贵族进行统治？
What was that like? Ruling without the rich?

坦格利安家族已经覆灭
House Targaryen is gone.

没一个活着的亲人能来支持您
Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you.

史塔克家族也完了
The Starks are gone as well.

拜咱们的两个糟糕老爹一手所赐
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

剩下的兰尼斯特
The remaining members of House Lannister

不会支持你 永远不会
will never back you, not ever.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩也不会
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

他全靠抢您的位子 才有机会坐上铁王座
His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours.

那么就剩提利尔家族了
That leaves the Tyrells.

可能性存在 但也不够
Not impossible, not enough.

兰尼斯特 坦格利安 拜拉席恩 史塔克 提利尔
Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

他们无非是车轮上的辐条
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

轮流登顶
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

彼此倾轧 碾碎身下的尘埃
And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.

想停下车轮 这梦想挺美
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

可惜您不是头一个这么做梦的
You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.

我无意阻止它行进
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

我要粉碎这车轮本身
I'm going to break the wheel.

亚赞・佐・夸格兹
奴隶主

你说过 谁打赢了 就能在大角斗场为女王献艺
You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

我赢了
I won.

你打了我 那就抽我几鞭子消消气
You struck me. Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

但你最出色的角斗士是我
But I'm the best you've got.

要是我在大角斗场赢了
If I win at the Great Pit,

你转手能卖上多少钱？
how much can you sell me for?

你有自由之身
You're a free man.

想去哪都行
You could have gone anywhere.

干嘛要回来？
Why did you come back?

让我为她而战
Let me fight for her

我就归你了
and I belong to you.

渴吗？
Thirsty?

认罪吧
Confess.

你知道 我总有一天能出去
I'll get out of here, you realize, before long.

认罪吧
Confess.

我能让你一夜暴富
I can make you a wealthy woman.

或者当上宫廷仕女
A lady of the court.

认罪吧
Confess.

也能让你死得惨不忍睹
Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable.

我坐在这 满脑子想的
And all I do is sit here

都是能干掉你的种种酷刑
imagining hideous ways for you to die.

山姆威尔・塔利
“杀手” 守夜人事务官

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿和妻子

疼么？
Does it hurt?

不疼了
No.

那就好
Good.

你怎么样？
How are you?

挨人揍还被踩脸的又不是我
I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.

你明白我在说什么
You know what I mean.

我没事
I'm good.

你害怕么？有一点
Are you scared? A little.

我也是
Me, too.

谁啊？奥利
Who's there?  Olly.

噢
Oh.

快进来
Come in.

我听说了你的事
I heard what happened.

噢 别担心
Oh, not to worry.

男人嘛 时不时就得打一架 很正常
Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.

奥利
守夜人新兵

我猜你大概想吃点东西
Figured you were hungry.

啊 真是个好小子
Oh, you're a good lad.

如果方便的话
Wanted to ask you something

我想问你点事情
if you've got the time.

我得去看一眼小山姆
I need to check on baby Sam.

那么 有什么能帮到你的么？
Now then, how can I help?

关于司令大人的事情 嗯？
It's about the Lord Commander. Yes?

他到艰难屯救野人去了
He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings.

野人杀了我父母
Wildlings killed my mom and dad.

还把我村子里的人杀光了
They killed everyone in my village.

我们和他们打了很多年
We've been fighting them for years.

那不是打仗
This wasn't a fight.

我们只是农民 他们还下手屠杀
We were farmers and they slaughtered us.

所以这些家伙有什么好救的？
So why is he saving them?

野人也是人
Wildlings are people.

和我们一样 有好 也有坏
Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones.

和他一起走的 红胡子的那个
The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard,

带头屠村的就是他
he led the raid on my village.

奥利 司令怎么能相信他？
Oh, Olly. How can he trust him?

我见过死人军团
I've seen the army of the dead.

见过异鬼
I've seen the white walkers.

它们的目标是我们 是世上所有生灵
And they're coming for us, for all the living.

到那时
And when it's time,

每一个人的力量都是必须的
we'll need every last man we can find.

但要是野人进了长城
But what if we let the wildlings through the gates

趁我们睡觉把我们全杀了 怎么办？
and they cut our throats while we sleep?

琼恩确实在冒险 但不得不这样
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.

别无选择
We don't stand a chance otherwise.

有时侯 人必须做出艰难的抉择
Sometimes a man has to make hard choices,

他人看来或许觉得有错
choices that might look wrong to others,

但当事人明白 长远地看 这个抉择是对的
but you know are right in the long run.

你真这么想？
You believe that?

确信无疑
With all my heart.

别担心 奥利
Try not to worry, Olly.

我为琼恩操心好多年了
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

但他总会平安归来
He always comes back.

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令

托蒙德
“巨人克星” 野人

转弯！
Turn us about!

你相信我么 琼恩・雪诺？
You trust me, Jon Snow?

艾迪森・托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪” 守夜人事务官

要说信的话会不会显得我在犯傻？
Does that make me a fool?

现在咱俩都在犯傻喽
We're fools together now.

骸骨之王
Lord of Bones.

叮当衫
野人 “骸骨之王”

好久不见
Been a long time.

上回见面 小乌鸦还是你的囚犯
Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner.

现在倒过来了 咋回事？
The other way around now. What happened?

打仗
War.

打仗？你管那叫打仗？
War? You call that a war?

北境从未见过的大军
The greatest army the North has ever seen

被个南方国王打得稀里哗啦
cut to pieces by some southern king.

咱们还是召集长者
We should gather the elders,

找个安静的地方好好谈谈吧
find somewhere quiet to talk.

这里由不得你下命令
You don't give the orders here.

我也没下命令
I'm not giving an order.

你的镣铐呢？
Why aren't you in chains?

他不是我的囚犯
He's not my prisoner.

不是？
No?

那他算啥？
What is he?

盟友
We're allies.

你个天杀的叛徒
You fucking traitor.

跟乌鸦一伙了？
You fight for the crows now?

我没和乌鸦一伙
I don't fight for the crows.

我们来这不是为了打架 是来谈判的
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

是么
Is that right?

托蒙德 你和那俏乌鸦话挺多的嘛？
You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?

等话说完了
And when you're done talking,

是不是还要跪下来含他老二？
do you get down on your knees and suck his cock?

召集长者 咱们来谈谈
Gather the elders and let's talk.

我叫琼恩・雪诺
My name's Jon Snow.

是守夜人的总司令
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

我与诸位不是朋友
We're not friends.

过去从未当过朋友
We've never been friends.

今天更不会变成朋友
We won't become friends today.

我今天不谈友谊
This isn't about friendship.

只谈生存
This is about survival.

温旺・威格・温旺・铎迩・温旺
巨人 简称旺旺

谈的是用700尺高的长城
This is about putting a 700foot wall

将你我与那一侧的邪物隔开
between you and what's out there.

建长城把我们关在外面的是你们
You built that wall to keep us out.

什么时候起乌鸦倒关心起我们死活来了？
Since when do the crows give two shits if we live?

平时当然不会 但当下可是非常时刻
In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times.

异鬼才不管对面的是自由民还是乌鸦
The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow.

对他们来说都一样 亡者大军的养料而已
We're all the same to them, meat for their army.

但若我们联手 便可击败他们
But together we can beat them.

还想击败异鬼？
Beat the white walkers?

祝你好运喽 说不定还能逃掉
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

我没耍花样
It's not a trick.

加入我们的人会得到这份礼物
It's a gift for those who join us.

龙晶
Dragonglass.

一个守夜人的汉子曾用这种匕首
A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers

杀死一个异鬼
to kill a walker.

你亲眼看见的？ 并没有
You saw this? No.

但我相信他
But I trust the man.

古老的传说里提到过这些龙晶
There are old stories about dragonglass.

传说里还有猎犬大小的冰蜘蛛呢
There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.

就我们的经历来说 你不相信？
And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them?

跟我走 我会把这些武器分给你们
Come with me and I'll share these weapons.

跟你去哪儿？
Come with you where?

长城以南土地丰饶
There are good lands south of the Wall.

守夜人会放你们穿过隧道
The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel

允许你们在那片土地耕耘生息
and allow your people to farm those lands.

我认识曼斯・雷德
I knew Mance Rayder.

他从未真正想过同守夜人开战
He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.

只想为子民 为你们开辟新的生活
He wanted a new life for his people, for you.

而这正是我们准备带给你们的
We're prepared to give you that new life.

条件呢
If?

条件是你们得发誓在真正的战争打响之后加入我们
If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.

曼斯人呢
Where is Mance?

死了 怎么死的
He died. How?

我一箭射穿他的心脏
I put an arrow through his heart.

嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

依我说 咱们剜掉司令官大人眼珠子
I say we send the Lord Commander

送他回黑城堡去
back to Castle Black with no eyes.

喂 你们都没看到曼斯是怎么死的
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

我看见了
I did.

那个打垮我们军队的南方国王 史坦尼斯
The southern king who broke our army, Stannis,

想活活烧死曼斯 来吓唬我们
wanted to burn him alive to send us a message.

琼恩・雪诺没听那贱人的话
Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.

一箭给曼斯个痛快
His arrow was mercy.

他的行为充满勇气
What he did took courage.

现在要的就是这个
And that's what we need today,

有勇气放下恩怨
the courage to make peace

与世仇讲和
with men we've been killing for generations.

我父亲 我叔叔
I lost my father, my uncle,

还有两个兄弟 都死在狗日的乌鸦手上
and two brothers fighting the damn crows.

我可没要求你们忘掉血债
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

我心里也有一笔血账
I'll never forget mine.

曼斯攻打长城那晚就有五十个弟兄牺牲了
I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall.

我只是请求你们
But I'm asking you

想一想自己的孩子
to think about your children now.

要是我们不能联手
They'll never have children of their own

他们再没机会有自己的孩子了
if we don't band together.

长夜将至
The Long Night is coming

亡者紧随其后
and the dead come with it.

没有哪个部族能够阻挡它们的脚步
No clan can stop them.

自由民拦不住
The free folk can't stop them.

守夜人拦不住
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

南方国王们也拦不住
And all the southern kings can't stop them.

只有我们一起 所有人联手才行
Only together, all of us.

就算这样可能也不够
And even then it may not be enough,

但好歹能战上一场
but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.

托蒙德 你要为这家伙担保么
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

这小子模样比我俩闺女都俊俏
He's prettier than both my daughters,

但一身好武艺
but he knows how to fight.

年轻是年轻 但懂得怎么领军
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

他本来没必要来艰难屯的
He didn't have to come to Hardhome.

但还是来了 因为他需要我们
He came because he needs us

而我们也需要他
and we need him.

我的祖先要是知道我跟乌鸦联手
My ancestors would spit on me

肯定会唾弃我
if I broke bread with a crow.

我的祖先也会 不过管那么多 他们早就死了
So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.

我永远不会相信黑衣佬
I'll never trust a man in black.

但我相信你 托蒙德
But I trust you, Tormund.

你说怎么办
If you say this is the way,

我们听你的
we're with you.

就该这么办
This is the way.

我同意托蒙德
I'm with Tormund.

留在这儿 就是死路一条
We stay here, we're dead men.

跟乌鸦大人走 至少还有机会活
At least with King Crow, there's a chance.

托蒙德
Tormund.

那些新生活的屁话留你自个得了
Keep that new life you want to give us.

那些龙晶也是 乌鸦大人
And keep your glass, King Crow.

你们一登上他的船 他们就会割掉你们的喉咙
As soon as you get on his ships, they're gonna slit your throats

然后把尸体丢进颤抖海
and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

此人是我们的敌人
That's our enemy.

永远都是
That has always been our enemy.

瑟恩人真他妈讨嫌
I fucking hate Thenns.

动起来 当心点儿
Move it. Be careful.

快让他们往前挪 解开缆绳
Move 'em along, now. Castoff time.

好了 加把劲儿
That's it, come on.

跟我们南下的一共多少人? 有五千吗?
How many are with us? 5,000?

我不太擅长数数
I'm not good at counting.

很多人没一起来
We're leaving too many behind.

自由民们顽固得很
The free folk are stubborn.

你知道曼斯用了多久才把他们聚起来么？
You know how long it took Mance to band them together?

他娘的二十年
20 fucking years.

况且他比我更了解这些人
And he knew them better than I ever will.

他们吃的快没了 猎物也快没了
They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt.

到时候会妥协的
They'll come around.

各就各位 是
Get yourselves ready. Aye!

乔娜会照看你
Johnna is gonna look after you.

她来负责 你得听话
She's in charge. You listen to her.

看好她 站稳了
Take her. There you are.

我要和你一起走
I want to go with you.

我得和那艘船上的老人们一起
I need to get the old folks on the boats.

我稍后就来 说话算话
I'm right behind you. I promise.

去吧
Go on.

下一个
Another one.

快点儿 我们到时候再会合
Keep moving. We'll meet you out there.

那东西不能上船 太大了
Won't be able to take that on the boat. It's too big.

最后一个 还有三个 快点儿
 That's the last one!  Three more! Move on!

到处都还有龙晶没收拾
There's more dragonglass everywhere.

这也有龙晶
I've got some more daggers over here.

这把匕首收他包里
Put that dagger in his bag.

呃
Uh...



瞅你大爷



准备就绪
Steady!

关上门
Shut the gates.

关门
Close the gates!

关门
Shut the gates!

等等
Wait!

开门啊 放我们进去
Open the gate! Let us in!

救命
Help us!

求求你们快开门
Please open it!

开门啊
Open the gate!

弓箭手准备
Ready your arrows!

停下 停下 排好队 都排队
Wait! Wait! Keep in line! Keep in line!

排队
Get in line!

去前线
Get to the front!

继续 射烂他们
Go on, shoot it!

停下 停下 邓肯 维持秩序 队列别乱
Wait, wait! Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line!

司令官大人
Lord Commander!

把他们都弄上船再回来找我
Get them to the ship and come back for me!

但你可怎么 快去
But you'll never makeNow!

让我上船 让我上船
Let me on! Let me on!

快他妈让开 快出发
Bloody fucking move! Let go!

你应该上船的
You should be on one of those boats.

你不也是 我的丫头们已经上船了
So should you. My little girls got on.

要是你不在场 他们会让我们穿过长城么
They're gonna let them pass the Wall even if you're not there?

我说到做到 已经下过命令了
You have my word. I've given orders.

估计到时你也不会在场敦促他们
Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders.

要是它们攻破防线 大伙都得死
If they get through, everyone dies.

守夜人的汉子们 随我来
Night's Watch, with me!

都动起来 快
Move! Move!

快
Move!

别 不要
No, no!

托蒙德 拿雪橇过来 好的 好的
Tormund, the sleigh! Okay, okay!

得用龙晶
The dragonglass.

那就跟我去拿
You and me, then!

快走！
Go!

去拿龙晶
Get the glass.

起来
Come on!

龙晶还没拿
The dragonglass.

别管什么狗屁龙晶了 命都要没啦！
Fuck the glass! We are gonna die here!

哎呀 我操
Oh, fuck!

托蒙德 快跑
Tormund, run!

旺旺 去海边
Wun Wun, to the sea.
