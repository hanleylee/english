那是伊斯蒙岛吗？
Is that Estermont?

那是塔斯 詹姆爵士
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

蓝宝石岛
The Sapphire Isle.

我们为什么要坐商船？
Why are we on a merchant ship?

也不挂兰尼斯特的帆？
Why no Lannister sails?

波隆
骑士

这艘船驶往旧镇
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

但我们会在阳戟城附近提早下船
We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear.

趁夜色自己划进多恩海岸
Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.

你去过多恩吗？
You ever been to Dorne?

没有 我去过
No. I have.

多恩民风彪悍 天天只想着打和操
The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck,

操和打 能回去你应该很开心啊
fuck and fight. You should be happy to go back.

没什么比好好打一架更能激起操的兴致
There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking.

也没什么比操意乱情迷的多恩妞
And there's nothing like a fuckmad Dornish girl

更能让人振奋精神 再打一架
to clear your head for the next fight.

二者相辅相成
It's how the two work together.

我敢肯定我们会打上不少架
And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure.

百分之百肯定 但我不觉得咱们会有时间在这儿逗留
Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest.

绑了他们的公主就得开溜了
Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

我们不是绑架他们的公主
We are not kidnapping their princess.

是救我的外甥女 带她回家
We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,

你外甥女?
Your niece?

我干这行很久了
I've been doing this sort of thing a long time.

驾轻就熟
I'm good at it.

所以把你带上啊 我明白
That's why you're here. I know.

可你为什么要来? 为什么不派40个人 或者干脆派一支军队？
Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army?

你又不是两手空空 而是兵权在握
Unlike most folks, you actually got one.

因为我不想挑起战争
Because I don't want to start a war.

这还是说不通你为啥这么做
That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.

我必须亲自来
It has to be me.

我觉得这事吧
If I'm putting something of a lit together,

一个就一只手
a onehanded man,

又在整个维斯特洛无人不识的人 实在是不… 
who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not...

我必须亲自来
It has to be me.

你弟弟是你放的 对不
You set your brother free, didn't you?

你姐肯定火大吧
I bet your sister didn't like that.

把他放走的是瓦里斯
Varys set him free.

那么… 
Well...

如果你哪天见到那个小混蛋 替我跟他问声好
if you ever see the little fucker, give him my regards.

他杀了我父亲
He murdered my father.

我要能再见着他 我先得劈了他
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

再替你跟他问声好
And then I'll give him your regards.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
太后

铁金库已向王室索还十分之一的债务
The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts.

鉴于重建王城的支出 王室这次能出多少？
Given the expensive rebuilding of... How much can the Crown afford?

凛冬将至啊 顶多他们索要的一半吧
With winter coming, half what they ask.

梅斯・提利尔
高庭公爵 玛格丽・提利尔之父
财政大臣

也许更少 你是财政大臣
Less. You're the Master of Coin.

你有什么想法吗？提利尔家族可以先垫上些金子
How do we pay them? House Tyrell could front the gold and the...

派席尔
大学士

当然王室也要按时还清 不然我就得找我女儿聊聊了
the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.

科本
被剥夺项链的学士
情报总管

您已经为我们做得够多了
You've already given us too much.

不 我们还是要和铁金库协商出更有利于我们的条件
No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.

那是当然 派专人去谈
Absolutely. In person.

我吗？
Me?

我们必须派遣一位使节去铁金库
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

此人必须身居高位 让铁金库看见我们的诚意
someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect.

您是财政大臣 没人比您更称职了
As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.

我很荣幸 陛下
I will be honored, Your Grace.

国王陛下对他岳父大人此行的安全深表担忧
The King has expressed concern about his fatherinlaw's safety on this voyage.

他已下令马林爵士亲自护送您前往
He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.

马林・特兰
御林铁卫

一位御林铁卫?
A valiant Kingsguard?

请替我表达…  一路顺风 提利尔大人
Please express... Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

那是 那是 我定会替各位向布拉佛斯的巨人问好
Of course, of course, I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.

这个小议会真是越变越小了呢
The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

还不够小
Not small enough.

您要喝杯酒么 主教大人
May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?

不了
No.

大麻雀
现任总主教
七神的代言人

前任主教通常会要一杯葡萄酒的
The old High Septon would have asked the vintage.

我本该说我们的心智是供奉七神的圣殿
I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven

应当保持纯洁
and should be kept pure.

但事实上
But the truth is,

我是不喜欢酒的味道
I don't like the taste.

那有什么能为您效劳的呢？
How may I serve?

整个维斯特洛都听闻有教士被活活烧死
All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned.

静默姐妹惨遭奸污
Silent sisters raped.

神职人员横尸街道
Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

战争教会了人民要向刀剑俯首
Wars teach people to obey the sword,

而不是众神
not the Gods.

也许众神需要自掌刀剑
Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own.

在坦格利安王朝之前
In the days before the Targaryens,

曾有教团武装代表七神执行正义
the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.

可是教团武装两百多年前就解散了
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.

如果我对我儿子 也就是国王陈述此事
If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king,

毫无疑问 他会签署法令批准您集结可靠的信众
I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you find worthy.

组成一支I卫众生肉体和灵魂的军队
An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.

一支侍奉七神的军队
An army and service to the Gods themselves.

当然也是听命于您的军队
And to you, of course.

毕竟您是七神的代言人
As the chosen representative of the Seven.

我未尝期盼过如此荣耀
An honor I've never expected.

甚至不曾想过
Or indeed, ever wished for.

这恰是您被选中的原因
Which is why you were chosen.

您和我都深知这世界运行的规律
You and I both know how the world works.

很多时候奸邪之辈和巨富之人往往游离在法律之外
Too often the wicked or the wealthiest be on the reach of justice.

国王甚至都无法制裁这些应当受罚的人
The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.

所有罪人在七神面前都是平等的
All sinners are equal before the Gods.

倘若我告诉您在我们中间就有这么一个
What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our own midst?

被黄金和特权保护着的大罪人呢？
Shielded by gold and privilege.

愿天父公正地审判他
May the Father judge him justly.

救命！ 救命！
Help me! Help me!

啊
Aah!

奥利法
男妓

这是培提尔・贝里席大人的产业
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

死基佬！
Cocksucker!

恋童癖！
Boy fucker!

野蛮的脏货！
You barbaric filth!

七层地狱有专门为你们这种人准备的地方
There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.

求求你们了 我会付钱的
Please, please, I'll pay!

我会付钱给你们所有人
I'll pay all of you.

是的 你会付出代价！
Yes, you will!

凯冯之子 瑟曦和詹姆的堂弟

洛拉斯・提利尔
“百花骑士”

抓住他
Seize him.

放开我
Get your hands off of me.

提利尔家族的洛拉斯爵士 你触犯了诸神与凡人的法律
Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.

你以为你是什么东西？
Who do you think you are?

公正
Justice.

托曼・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

为什么把我哥哥关进牢房？
Why is my brother in a cell?

我 我也不清楚
II don't know.

不是我下的命令啊
II didn't order it.

你我都清楚是谁干的
We both know who did.

你跟我说她要回凯岩城
You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.

玛格丽・提利尔
托曼・拜拉席恩的王后

你是在说我母亲在背后谋划了这一切?
Are you saying my mother is behind this?

她嫉妒你不再是她的了
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.

逮捕我哥哥就是对我的报复
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

你和母亲不是关系融洽么？
Aren't you and mother getting along?

哦 我亲爱的甜心国王陛下啊
Oh, my sweet, sweet King.

您到底爱不爱我呢
Do you have any affection for me at all?

当然爱啊
Of course I do.

你是我的王后
You're my Queen.

想到我哥被关在污秽不堪的地牢 我就无法忍受
I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.

我去为你释放他
I'll set him free for you.

你保证？
You promise?

我下令即刻释放洛拉斯爵士!
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!

是我逮捕他的么？
Did I arrest him?

这倒不是
Well, no...

可是你武装了教团武装
But you armed the Faith Militant.

给了大麻雀一支军队
You gave the High Sparrow an army.

是的
I did.

你妻子自然也就有权抱怨你
And your wife has every right to criticize.

不能任由宗教狂逮捕王后的兄长 即使他有悖人伦
Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.

这样的话
Then...

我可以告诉玛格丽您将要放了洛拉斯爵士吗
can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?

我早已说过我没有拘禁洛拉斯爵士
I told you I am not holding Ser Loras.

您是国王 我相信如果您向大麻雀求情 他一定会释放这个可怜人
You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.

停轿!
Halt!

主教大人正在祈祷 不许有人打扰
His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.

只要您下令 我们立刻将这反贼碎尸万段
Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.

你是说 杀了他们? 在这圣堂里?
You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?

您这是送他们去见自己热爱的七神
You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.

杂种！
Bastard!

你这怪胎！
You're an abomination!

生来罪恶!
You're born of sin!

臭杂种!
Filthy bastard!

我们另找一条路
We'll find another way.

怪胎!
Abomination!

王后
My Queen.

不用武力根本不可能救出洛拉斯爵士
There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.

您是安达尔人的国王
You're the King of the Andals,

七大王国之主 全境守护
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm.

您却任由一群疯子囚禁您的小舅子
And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.

我去和大麻雀谈谈 真的吗? 何时?
I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow. Are you? When?

我… 我不知道 您不知道?
II don't know. You don't know?

他刚刚在祈祷
He was praying just now.

我得去告诉祖母
I have to send word to Grandmother.

你一会儿还回来吗?
Will you come back later?

我需要和我的家人在一起 陛下
I need to be wit my family, Your Grace.

这是自然
Of course.

你对这个男孩寄予厚望
You think highly of this boy.

艾迪森・托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪” 守夜人事务官

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令

很好
Good.

守夜人的总司令 小酒馆里妓女的私生子
Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. A bastard by some tavern slut.

也许吧 不过奈德・史塔克不像这样的人
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

赛丽丝・佛罗伦
史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩之王后

我本该为你生个男孩
I should have given you a son.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
长城上的王

不是你的错 那是谁的错呢？
Not your fault. Whose then?

我什么也没给您 只有软弱
I gave you nothing but weakness.

和畸形
And deformity.

这些伤疤对光之王来说不算什么
Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.

夫人
My Lady.

她父亲是光之王选中的国王
Her father is the Lord's chosen King.

她父亲的血液也流淌在她的体内
And her father's blood runs through her veins.

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

您将进军临冬城
You march on Winterfell soon.

我们必须这么做
We must.

才能战胜这风雪
To beat the snows.

您曾经相信戴佛斯爵士 把我扔在脑后
Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.

我希望您不要再犯同样的错误
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

我不会的
I won't.

我需要你
I need you.

陛下 您只需要信仰
You only need faith, my King.

那么夫人 你需要什么呢?
And you, my Lady, what do you need?

Lady Caulfield.

山姆威尔・塔利
“杀手” 守夜人事务官

斯莫伍德爵士
Lord Smallwood.

我从未听说过这些人
Never even heard of these people.

他们也从未听说过您
They haven't heard of you either.

但我们需要人手 他们有人手
But we need men and they have some.

这位梅森爵士可以提供多少人手呢?
How many men does this Lord Mayzen have to send us?

比韦伯利爵士能给的多
More than Lord Wibberley.

不给他写 那给谁呢?
Not him. Then who?

我也不想 但是我们需要人手和吃的
I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies.

而卢斯波顿是北境守… 
And Roose Bolton is the Warden of...

他杀了我兄弟 我们早已宣誓成为长城上的守夜人
He murdered my brother. We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall.

我们不能依靠五十个兄弟守卫长城
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

而没有北境守护的帮助 我们也无法招募更多人手
And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.

抱歉 夫人
Apologies, my Lady.

总司令大人
Lord Commander.

有何贵干？
How can I help you?

Come with us when we ride south.

你对城堡的了解胜过我们所有人
None of us know the castle as well as you do.

机关隧道 城防弱点 世俗民情
Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.

临冬城曾是你的家
Winterfell was your home once.

难道你不想把这帮耗子赶出家门?
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

现在我的家是黑城堡
Castle Black is my home now.

守夜人从不参与七大王国的战争
Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

这世上只有一场战争
There's only one war.

生与死的对抗
Life against death.

来吧
Come.

让我告诉你将要为何而战
Let me show what you're fighting for.

你会给我看火中的幻象
You're gonna show me some vision in the fire.

对不起 夫人
Forgive me, my Lady.

我不相信幻象
But I don't trust in visions.

没有幻象
No visions.

没有魔法
No magic.

只有生命
Just life.

你能感受到我心脏的搏动吗?
Do you feel my heart beating?

你有强大的力量 你在抗拒它 这是你的错误 请拥抱它
This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.

天生男女
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

其质有别
Two parts of a greater whole.

可您却拒绝这力量
You're not joining this power.

或曰可创生
Power to make life,

或曰可有光
power to make light,

或曰阴影召之即来
and power to cast shadows.

我不认为史坦尼斯大人喜欢这样
I don't think Stannis would like that very much.

那我们就不告诉他
Then we shouldn't tell him.

我不能这么做
I can't.

为什么?
Why?

我发过誓
I swore a vow.

我爱着另一个人
I loved another.

死者不需要爱人
The dead don't need lovers.

只有活人才需要
Only the living.

我知道
I know.

可我仍然爱她
But I still love her.

你什么都不懂 琼恩・雪诺
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

希琳・拜拉席恩
史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩的女儿

你寂寞吗？
Are you lonely?

只是无聊
Just bored.

我父亲曾告诉我无聊是内心缺乏动力的体现
My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.

你也经常感到无聊吗?
Were you bored a lot, too?

我知道黑城堡并不是孩子玩耍的地方
I know Castle Black is no place for a child.

我喜欢
I like it.

我曾以为我会被扔在家里
I thought I'd be left at home.

我知道母亲不想带我来
I know mother didn't want to bring me.

你为什么这么说?
Why do you say that?

她说过“我并不想带上你”
She told me "I don't want to bring you."

她不该这么说
She shouldn't have said that.

您因我感到羞耻吗 父亲?
Are you ashamed of me, father?

当你还是个婴儿的时候
When you were an infant,

有个多恩商人来过龙石岛
the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone.

他的货物都没什么意思 除了一只木玩偶
His goods were junk except for one wooden doll.

他还用我们家族的颜色给玩偶缝衣服
He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House.

毫无疑问 他听说了你降生的消息
No doubt he'd heard of your birth.

认定新科父亲都容易上当
And assumed new fathers were easy targets.

我还记得当我将玩偶放入摇篮时 你微笑的样子
I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle.

你将玩偶贴在小脸上
You pressed it to your cheek.

当我们烧掉那玩偶的时候 已经太晚了
By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late.

他们说你会死
I was told you would die.

或者更糟
Or worse.

灰鳞将会慢慢生长
The grayscale would go slow.

等你长大到刚刚开始了解世界的年纪 就将你夺走
Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you.

所有人都建议将你送到瓦雷利亚的废墟中去
Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria

与石民一起度过短暂的生命
to live out your short life with the Stone men,

以免疾病在城堡中扩散
before the sickness spread to the castle.

我告诉他们全都滚蛋
I told them all to go to hell.

我召集了世界上所有的学士
I called in every maester on this side of the world.

医师 药剂师
Every healer, every apothecary.

他们控制住了病情 拯救了你的生命
They stopped the disease and saved your life.

因为你不该在世界另一边和那些可怕的石民生活
Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men.

你是拜拉席恩家族的希琳公主
You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

更是我的女儿
And you are my daughter.

珊莎・史塔克


我就觉得能在这儿找到你
I thought I might find you here.

你的姑妈莱安娜
Your Aunt Lyanna.

我父亲从不提起她
My father never talked about her.

有时我会看到他下来 点起蜡烛
Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles.

大家都说她是个美人
They say she was beautiful.

我见过她一次
I saw her once.

那时我还小 住在你母亲家
I was a boy, living with your mother's family.

培提尔・贝里席

令尊
your father,

劳勃・拜拉席恩
Robert Baratheon,

还有莱安娜 那时她已经和劳勃订了婚
and Lyanna. She was already promised to Robert.

你可以想像 对于一个小地方来的 籍籍无名的小子
You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere,

当时是什么感觉
with nothing to his name,

看着那些传奇人物 在竞技场比武争冠
watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists.

进入决赛的两名骑士
The last two riders were

是巴利斯坦・赛尔弥和雷加・坦格利安
Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen.

当雷加夺冠后 所有人都为王子高声欢呼
When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince.

我记得当他脱掉头盔 露出一头银发 所有女孩都为之欢笑
I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair.

他是那么英俊
How handsome he was.

直到他纵马经过妻子 伊莉亚・马泰尔
Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell,

所有的笑容都僵住了
and all the smiles died.

我从未见过那么多人鸦雀无声
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

他越过了他的妻子
He rode past his wife

将冰雪玫瑰桂冠放在莱安娜膝上
and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap.

蓝如霜雪
Blue as frost.

成千上万人因为雷加选择你的姑姑而丧命
How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

没错 他选择了她
Yes, he chose her.

然后绑架了她 强奸了她
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

走吧
Come.

我们换个地方说话 免得亡灵们听见
Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us.

你换了骑马装？ 是的
Dressed for riding? I am.

你要去哪？
Where are you going?

君临
King's Landing.

君临？
King's Landing?

瑟曦召我去
Cersei sent for me.

我们可不能让她起疑心
We must not let her sniff out any trouble.

你不能把我丢在这儿
You can't leave me here.

我知道和你鄙视的人共处有多艰难 相信我
I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me.

不会太久的
But it won't be for long.

你怎么知道
How do you know?

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩驻军在黑城堡
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.

在大雪封路之前他定会南下进军君临
He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way.

但是首先 他必须拿下临冬城
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

你怎么能肯定 我很肯定
You don't know that. I do.

一旦他从波顿家族手中拿下这些地盘
Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons

就会把你父亲的封臣收归麾下
he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause.

有了北境的支持
With the North behind him,

史坦尼斯才能拿下铁王座
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

你觉得他能击败波顿家族？
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

他麾下军队更强大
He has a larger army.

而且他是维斯特洛最杰出的指挥官
He's the finest military commander in Westeros.

任何赌徒都会押注在史坦尼斯身上
A betting man would put his money on Stannis.

我就是这样一个赌徒
As it happens, I am a betting man.

如果你押对了呢？
And if you're right?

史坦尼斯会攻克临冬城
Stannis takes Winterfell,

将你从北境最令人不齿的家族手中解救出来
he rescues you from the most despised family in the North.

史坦尼斯会感激你父亲曾经有胆识的支持他继位
Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim,

并封你为北境守护
he names you Wardeness of the North.

但我… 我不… 
But I... I wouldn't...

北境守护…  你是唯一幸存的史塔克
Wardeness of the North... You are the last surviving Stark.

他需要你
He needs you.

如果你押错了呢？
What if you're wrong?

如果史坦尼斯不攻打临冬城 又或者他来攻打却吃了败仗呢？
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?

那你就嫁给波顿家的儿子 拉姆斯 让他对你言听计从
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.

我不知道该怎么做 你当然知道
I don't know how to do that. Of course you do.

他已经被你迷倒了
He's already fallen for you.

我很害怕他父亲 这很正常 他的确是个危险人物
His father frightens me. He should, he's a dangerous man.

但即使最危险的人也可以智取
But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered.

而你正师从世上最足智多谋之人
And you learned to maneuver from the very best.

我很快就会回来
I return before too long.

我不在身边你会更坚强
You'll be strong without me.

北境必将属于你
The North will be yours.

你相信我吗？
Do you believe me?

我想等你回来我就是有夫之妇了
I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.

有早餐了
Breakfast.

刚才你要是死了可不太光彩
That would have been a shit way to die.

要我说 怎么死都不光彩
As far as I've seen, they're all shot way to die.

是啊 但是你们这种人在歌手的故事里应该有个精彩的结局
Aye. But y'all ought to give the singers a good ending.

我不在乎死后歌手怎么唱我
I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.

是吗？
No?

两个骑士 解救公主
Two knights, off to rescue a princess.

要我说这歌肯定不错 跟别的歌也没什么两样
Sounds like a good song to me. Sounds like all the rest.

你呢？你会选择怎么个死法？
What about you? What shit way would you choose?

在我自个儿的城堡 喝着自个儿的酒 看着我的儿子们争夺我的财产
In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my son gravel from a fortune.

真无聊 我还以为你有什么刺激的想法
How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.

我活的够刺激了 最好还是死的无聊点儿
I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring.

你又想怎么死？ 死在我爱的女人怀里
How do you want to go? In the arms of the woman I love.

她也这么想吗？
She want the same thing?

走吧
Let's go.

那条船的船长… 
The captain to that ship...

他是哪儿人 布拉佛斯？ 潘托斯人
What was he, Braavosi? Pentoshi.

他要去旧镇
And he's headed to Oldtown.

我说过了
As I said.

怎么？
Why?

他为什么不把船靠岸
What's to stop him from docking down the coast

告诉当地人詹姆・兰尼斯特到了多恩？
and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?

我给了他一袋金龙
A bag of gold.

我想你还不明白
I'm not sure you understand

这地方有多少人仇恨你的家族
how much people hate your family in this part of the world.

那袋金龙够沉
It was a heavy bag.

我猜他肯定各种赌咒发誓才拿到那笔钱
And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.

但是他破了誓你也不知道
But you won't be around if he breaks them.

有几个？
How many you count?

四个
Four.

你能打几个？
How many you think you can take?

一个 他身手慢的话
One, if he's slow.

停下！
Halt!

该死的
Fucked in the arse.

驾！
Hiya!

早啊 伙计们
Morning, lads.

可算找到你们了
Glad we found you.

你们是谁
Who are you?

库珀
Cooper.

这是达内尔
This is Darnell.

你们从君临来
You're from King's Landing.

口音太明显了哈
Accent gave you away?

跳蚤窝来的
Flea Bottom.

下层人
Whelped and whipped.

你们来干嘛？
Why are you here?

我们晚上翻了船
Our ship capsized in the night.

好不容易游上了岸
We managed to swim ashore.

真是死里逃生
It was a near thing, really.

我以为要喂鲨鱼了
I thought the sharks would get us.

多恩没有鲨鱼
There are no sharks in Dorne.

我发誓看到了鲨鱼鳍
I could have sworn those were shark fins.

也许是海豚
Dolphins maybe.

把剑扔到地上
Throw your swords in the sand.

伙计们 没这个必要吧
Boys, there's no need for this.

给我们指个路就行
Just, point us in the right direction.

我们会自己回家的
We'll find our way home.

把剑扔到地上！
Swords in the sand!

快点！
Now!

这家伙应该够慢了
That one should be slow enough.

干得漂亮！
Nice move!

运气好
Luck.

你有个好老师
You had a wonderful teacher.

我一直都想要匹多恩骏马
Always wanted a Dornish stallion.

这畜牲跑一天一夜都不嫌累
Beasts can run a day and night without tiring.

现在我们吹着小风就骑到流水花园了
We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.

我们得先把尸体埋了
But first we need to bury these bodies.

鸟也得吃东西啊
Birds have to eat too.

尸体会带来麻烦 麻烦会引来军队
Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies.

我们不是来开战的
We're not here to start a war.

你知道咱俩挖这么多坑得花多久吗？
Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?

我一只手可挖不好坑
I can't dig very well with one hand.

准确地说 是挖不了
Not at all, really.

妈妈… 
Nama...

艾拉莉亚・沙德
奥柏伦的情妇

娜梅 奥芭娅 会开战吗？
Nym, Obara. Will it be war?

道朗亲王会哀悼你父亲 仅此而已
Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else.

我们只能自己为奥柏伦报仇
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

道朗不支持 我们没有军队对抗兰尼斯特
Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.

开战不一定得要军队
We don't need an army to start a war.

瑟曦太后很爱她的孩子们
Queen Cersei loves her children.

其中一个在我们手里 我们可能有个麻烦
...and we have one of them. We may have a problem.

这个船长来板条镇找到我 说有个消息要卖给我
A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell.

他说他把詹姆・兰尼斯特运到了多恩
He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

他是为弥赛而来
He's come for Myrcella.

如果他先我们一步接触弥赛
If he gets to her before we do,

我们就失去了复仇的唯一机会
we lose our only chance for revenge.

你们必须做出选择… 
You must choose...

支持道朗 维持和平
Doran's way and peace,

或者支持我… 
or my way...

开战
and war.

我追随你 永远
I'm with you. Always.

娜梅？
Nym?

奥芭娅？
Obara?

我小时候 奥柏伦找到我 说要带我进宫
When I was a child, Oberyn came to take me to court.

我从来没见过他
I'd never seen this man, and yet

他却自称是我父亲
he called himself my father.

我母亲哭着说 我还小 又是女孩
My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.

奥柏伦把他的矛扔在我脚下 说
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said

“不论女孩男孩 都有仗要打”
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles.

“只不过诸神让我们选择各自的武器”
"But the Gods let us choose our weapons."

我父亲指了指自己的长矛
My father pointed to the spear,

又指了指母亲的眼泪
and then to my mother's tears.

很久以前我就做出了选择
I made my choice long ago.

多谢
Thank you.

你是谁？
Who are you?

抓住你的人
Your captor.

有酒吗？
Do you have wine?

没
No.

没有酒我可睡不着
I can't sleep without wine.

那就醒着
Then stay awake.

你走反方向了
You're going the wrong way.

我姐姐在维斯特洛
My sister's in Westeros.

维斯特洛… 在西边
Westeros...is west!

我们正往东走… 
We're heading east...

我没打算带你去见你姐姐
I'm not taking you to your sister.

那你说带我去见陛下
You said you were taking me to the Queen.

没错
I am.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安陛下
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

她才是我效忠的女王
She's the Queen I serve.

真是白瞎了这么成功的绑架
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

刚巧我正要去那里
So happens I was heading there myself!

你找女王要干什么？
What business would you have with the Queen?

金子和荣誉？
Gold and glory?

哦 还有仇恨
Oh, and hate.

你要是见过我老姐 自然明白
If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand.

这么说… 
So...

我们显然是一边的
now that it's clear we're on the same side.

一位来自维斯特洛北境的出身高贵的骑士
A high born knight from the North of Westeros,

沦落到厄斯索斯
down on his luck in Essos.

三头龙肩饰？
Dragon epaulettes?

胸甲上却是熊的家徽
Bear sigil breast plate.

你是乔拉・莫尔蒙
You're Jorah Mormont.

我必须得问问… 
I have to ask...

你在千里之外的妓院里厮混
how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house,

怎么算是效忠你的女王了？
half a world away?

有没有可能
Is it possible,

你正在逃亡？
that you were running?

你为什么要逃亡？
Why would you be running?

她为何要赶你走呢？
And why would she have sent you away?

哦 等等
Oh, wait!

你原本是在监视她 对不对？
You were spying on her, weren't you?

这下我想起来了
It's all coming back to me!

尽管每次御前会议我都醉醺醺的 但是我全想起来
I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back.

你给瓦里斯的小小鸟递消息
You passed notes to Varys's little birds.

被她发现了 是吗？
She found out, didn't she?

发现之后就把你流放了
Found out, and exiled you.

现在你希望带一件礼物 讨回她的欢心
And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift.

有点冒险… 
A risky scheme...

甚至可以说是孤注一掷
One might even say, desperate.

你认为丹妮莉丝会处决我 然后宽恕你？
Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you?

我觉得很可能正好相反
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

从这看去 人人都很开心
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

怎么？
What?

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母

我想起了你哥哥
I was thinking of all the times your brother

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
“无畏的” 女王铁卫

他总是走出红堡 到君临街头 要我跟着
made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.

为什么？ 他喜欢到人民之中
Why? He liked to walk among the people,

他喜欢为他们唱歌
he liked to sing to them.

他为他们唱歌？
He sang to them?

是的
Yes.

雷加会在钩巷或者种子街
Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook

找块地方演唱
or the Street of Seeds and he'd sing.

就跟其他歌手一样
Just like all the other minstrels.

那你做什么呢？
And what did you do?

我确保他不会被暗杀
I made sure no one killed him.

啊… 我还会收钱
And... I collected the money.

他想看看自己能挣多少钱
Well... he liked to see how much he could make.

他唱得好吗？ 非常好
He was good? He was very good.

韦赛里斯没跟你说过？
Viserys never told you?

他说雷加武艺高强
He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people.

但雷加不喜欢打打杀杀
Rhaegar never liked killing.

他喜欢唱歌
He loved singing.

收来的钱用来做什么呢？
And what did you do with the money?

有一次我们把钱给了街头的另一个歌手
Well, one time, we gave it to the next minstrel down the street.

又一次给了跳蚤窝的一个孤儿
One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

还有一次… 
One time...

我们喝得烂醉
we got horribly drunk.

陛下
Your Grace.

西茨达拉来了 正在觐见室等候
Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber.

达里奥・纳哈里斯
次子团团长
丹妮莉丝的情人

有多少人在等？
How many others are there?

五十… 一百
Fifty... a hundred.

你跟我一起吗 巴利斯坦爵士？
Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?

我想您接见西茨达拉・佐・洛拉克的时候 我可以保护您
I think I can protect you from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.

接见西茨达拉・佐・洛拉克的时候我能保护自己
I think I can protect me from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.

去吧 巴利斯坦爵士
Go, Ser Barristan.

为我唱首歌
Sing a song for me.

遵命陛下
Your Grace.

凡人皆有一死
All men must die.

但并非所有人都能死的光荣 光荣？
But not all can die in glory. Glory?

不然人们为何战斗？
Why else do men fight?

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

您的先祖为何会跨过狭海 征服七国？
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

西茨达拉・佐・洛拉克
弥林贵族

为了名垂青史
So their names would live on.

那些在竞技场上获胜的人 虽然不会成为国王… 
Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings...

但他们也会名垂青史
but their names will live on.

竞技场是他们最好的机会
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

你们为了取乐 让人们自相残杀的时候 也是这么对他们说的吗？
Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?

陛下 依照传统 今天是竞技场赛季开幕日
Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.

我不承认这一传统
I do not recognize this tradition.

传统是唯一把这座城市
Traditions are the only thing

您的城市 团结起来的根基
that will hold this city... your city, together.

没了传统 前奴隶和主子们没有任何共同语言
Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common.

除了数百年的猜忌
Nothing but centuries of mistrust

和仇恨
and resentment.

竞技场不一定能解决所有问题
I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems...

但这是个很好的开始
but it's a start.
