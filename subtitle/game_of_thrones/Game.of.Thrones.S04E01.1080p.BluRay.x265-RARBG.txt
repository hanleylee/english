权力的游戏

第四季第一集   Two Swords
双剑利刃

神作
Magnificent.

看上去像新铸的
Looks freshforged.

正是
It is.

瓦雷利亚毁灭以来
No one's made a Valyrian steel sword

没人锻出过瓦雷利亚钢剑
since the Doom of Valyria.

世上还有三名铁匠懂得如何重铸瓦雷利亚钢
There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel.

手艺最精的在瓦兰提斯
The finest of them was in Volantis.

应我之邀来到君临
Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.

您从哪里弄来这么多瓦雷利亚钢
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?

从一个再也用不到它的人那里
From someone who no longer had need of it.

您一直想要一柄瓦雷利亚钢族剑
You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.

现在有两柄了  两柄
 And now we have two.  Two?

原剑大得荒唐
The original weapon was absurdly large.

足够重铸两柄
Plenty of steel for two swords.

谢谢您  真是一柄好剑
Well, thank you. It's glorious.

你得练习左手
You'll have to train your left hand.

优秀的剑士懂得如何运用双手
Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.

你回不到从前了
You'll never be as good.

没错
No.

不过只要我还是比别人都强
But as long as I'm better than everyone else,

料也无妨
I suppose it doesn't matter.

你一只手无法胜任御林铁卫
You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.

哪里写着了  我能  我也会
Where's that written? I can and I will.

御林铁卫是终身誓言
The Kingsguard oath is for life.

战争已经结束  国王很安全
The war is over. The king is safe.

国王永远不安全
The king is never safe.

单是这座城里  就有多少人
How many people in this city alone

希望看他的头插上枪尖
would love to see his head on a pike?

你被俘时  有其他骑士护卫国王
Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner.

你回家之后也当如此
They will continue to do so when you go home.

回家  你要回凯岩城
 Home?  You'll return to Casterly Rock

代我统治
and rule in my stead.

您才是凯岩城公爵
You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

我是国王之手  我的位置在这里
I am the King's Hand. My place is here.

我死前不会再见到凯岩城了
I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.

您知道人们叫我什么
You know what they call me?

弑君者  背誓者
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

毫无荣誉之人
Man without honor.

您现在又要我违背神圣的誓言
Now you want me to break another sacred vow.

你不用违背任何誓言
You won't be breaking anything.

免除御林铁卫职务已有先例
There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

国王将行使这项特权
The king will exercise that prerogative.

不  不
 No.  No?

不
No.

我想我不是在询问你
I don't believe I asked you a question.

这是我的回答
There's my answer.

如果你以为你该死的荣誉高于家族...
If you think your bloody honor comes before your family...

我的荣誉早就无可挽回
My bloody honor is beyond repair,

但我的回答依然是不  我不要凯岩城
but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock.

我不想娶妻  不要生子
I don't want a wife. I don't want children.

你想要什么
What do you want?

晚餐就很好
Supper would be nice.

四十年来我努力教导你
For 40 years I've tried to teach you.

你至今还是不懂  你永远不会懂
If you haven't learned by now, you never will.

去吧
Go.

如果当个高级护卫就是你的全部志向
If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition,

那就去当你的
go serve.

我猜您想收回这柄剑
I suppose you want the sword back.

你留着罢
Keep it.

没有家族的独手汉需要有个依仗
A onehanded man with no family needs all the help he can get.

干一只山羊要几个多恩人
How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?

口下留德
Please don't.

要我说呀  酒馆才是旅人约见的上选
Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern.

那样吧  一方迟到了
That way, one party is late,

另一方还能屋里喝喝麦酒
the other party can drink some ale inside.

我们等的可是多恩亲王
This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for,

不是你的佣兵朋友
not one of your sellsword friends.

要是他来头这么大  干吗派你迎接
If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?

多恩的马泰尔与凯岩城的兰尼斯特
There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne

夙有血仇旧怨  不睦多年
and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.

万一多恩的马泰尔家
And just in case the Martells of Dorne

想要兰尼斯特血债血偿
are looking to spill some Lannister blood,

不如送你上门是吧  没必要冷嘲热讽
 it may as well be yours, eh?  No need for cynicism.

我刚好是个手腕圆滑的外交家
I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

他们来了
Ah, here we are.

能看清家徽吗
Can you read the sigils?

黄球子
Yellow balls?

紫色旗面上一堆柠檬
Wild lemons on a purple field,

柠檬林的达特家族
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

爪子里抓着婴儿的秃鹰  布莱蒙家族
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House Blackmont.

戴金冠的头骨  王冢城的曼伍笛家族
A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

这小子对多恩贵族可熟呢
Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

我也得搞个家徽
I need a sigil.

马泰尔家族的呢  金矛贯日
And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?

没看到  大人
I don't see it, my lord.

幸会  诸位大人
Well met, my lords.

以乔佛里陛下之名欢迎诸位
His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name.

我父亲大人  御前首相  也致以问候
My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well.

我是凯岩城的提利昂・兰尼斯特  财政大臣
I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, master of Coin.

请原谅
Forgive me.

怎没看到道朗亲王和诸位一道
I don't see Prince Doran in your company.

亲王贵体有恙  不便离开阳戟城
The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear.

他派胞弟奥柏伦亲王
He sends his brother Prince Oberyn

代他出席王家婚礼
to attend the royal wedding in his stead.

当然  有奥柏伦亲王这样的大英雄出席婚礼
Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior

国王陛下一定欣喜
as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.

是吗
Will he?

奥柏伦亲王殿下呢
And where is Prince Oberyn?

黎明前就到了
Arrived before dawn.

我们亲王不喜欢接风宴
Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.

诸位大人  就由都城守备队的好人们
Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch

护送诸位去红堡下榻
will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.

长途旅行想必劳累了
You must be weary after such a long journey.

好圆滑的外交手腕
Some accomplished diplomacy that was.

现在去哪儿
Now where?

我们得在奥柏伦亲王伤人性命或大开杀戒之前
We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody

找到他
or several somebodies.

这么大座城里找一个多恩人  你打算怎么找
How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?

如果你有操遍半个维斯特洛的名声
You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.

辛苦骑行两周  刚刚来到君临
You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads,

你会去哪儿
where would you go?

我八成倒头就睡  不过我是有点儿老了
I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.

瞧瞧这个
Look at this one.

她多好看
How lovely is she?

很美
Beautiful.

但是太苍白
But pale.

君临人喜欢白皮肤
They like them pale in the capital.

能显出她们不是田间粗妇
Shows they don't work the fields.

我吓到你了吗
Do I frighten you?

喜欢吗
You like?

太羞怯  羞怯让我厌倦
Timid. Timid bores me.

你很顽皮  是不是
You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

我想她喜欢你
I think she likes you.

她眼光不错
She has good taste.

你不羞怯吧
You're not timid, are you?

不羞怯
Not timid.

你喜欢女人吗
Do you like women?

像她这样的就喜欢  大人
When they look like her, my lord.

这个就很好
This one will do nicely.

您喜欢就好  夫人
Very good, my lady.

我可不是什么夫人
Oh, I'm not a lady.

只是我们这里客气的叫法
A term of courtesy in this establishment.

在哪里都是谎言
A lie anywhere.

为何不用正确的说法
Why not use the right words?

我是个私生女
I'm a bastard.

她是个妓女  你是什么呢
She is a whore. And you're what?

拉皮条的
A procurer.

其他人还需要吗
Any of the others?

那两个姑娘可以走了
The two girls can leave.

你留下
You stay.

可是我不卖身  大人
I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.

为小指头干活的人都能卖
Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer.

脱衣服  我们还有一阵子呢
Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.

大人  我是个亲王  小子
 My lord.  I am a prince, boy.

你跟亲王睡过吗
Have you ever been with a prince?

没有过
Can't say I have.

我很贵的
I'm wildly expensive.

脱掉你的衣服
Take off your clothes.

您喜欢哪种方式
Which way do you like it?

我的方式
My way.

奥伯伦
Oberyn.

奥伯伦  别去
Oberyn, don't.

*雨水在大厅哭泣*
Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall,

*内里却无人影*
and not a soul to hear.

你迷路了吗  朋友
You lost, friend?

很抱歉盯着你们看
Forgive me for staring.

在我的家乡很少见到兰尼斯特家的人
I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.

在君临也很少见到多恩人
I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.

我们不喜欢这里的臭气
We don't like the smell.

跟我走吧  爱人  天哪  你看她
 Come with me, lover.  Gods, look at this one.

先生们  请跟我来  我给你们准备单间
Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.

你怎么把这么正的女人给多恩人浪费
Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman?

给他牵头剃毛的山羊再来瓶橄榄油就行了
Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.

你们知道为什么全世界都恨兰尼斯特吗
Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?

你们自以为有金子有雄狮
You think your gold and your lions

还有金狮子  就高人一等了
and your gold lions make you better than everyone.

我能说个秘密吗
May I tell you a secret?

你可不是金狮子
You're not a golden lion.

只是一个拔剑太慢的
You're just a pink little man

粉面小鬼头而已
who is far too slow on the draw.

长剑可不适合近战
Longsword is a bad option in close quarters.

我一拔刀  你的朋友就会流血
When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding.

手腕血管密布  怕是要流很多
Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.

如果你即刻带他就医  那还有救
He'll live if you get him help straightaway.

那么  做决定吧
So, decisions.

奥伯伦亲王  请原谅我不请自来
Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.

我们听说您可能遇上...
We heard there might be...

麻烦
...trouble.

抱歉了  爱人
Apologies, my love.

我特此欢迎您来到君临
I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

这是艾拉莉亚・沙德  我的情妇
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

这位是国王的亲舅舅小恶魔
The king's own Uncle Imp.

提利昂  泰温・兰尼斯特之子
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

如果需要我为您做点什么...
If there's anything I can do to make your stay

你是谁  他雇的杀手吗
What are you? His hired killer?

以前是  现在我是骑士
It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

你怎么当上骑士的
How did that come to pass?

可能因为我杀对了人吧
Killed the right people, I suppose.

我们还需要几个姑娘  你们要姑娘吧
We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

你不来玩吗
You don't partake?

我以前玩  但现在我结婚了
Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

奥伯伦亲王  我能和您私下谈谈吗
Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?

看来我误进了兰尼斯特的窑子
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.

他们什么客都接  多恩人也不例外
 Oh, they take all kinds.  Even Dornishmen.

国王非常感激您远道而来
The king is very grateful that you traveled all

参加他的婚礼
this way for his wedding.

我们打开天窗说亮话  乔佛里受辱了
Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted.

毕竟我只是次子
I am only the second son after all.

同样作为次子
Well, speaking as a fellow second son,

我已经习惯了成为家族耻辱
I have grown rather used to being the family insult.

您为何来君临  奥伯伦亲王
Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

我受邀参加王室婚礼
I was invited to the royal wedding.

我们不是要说亮话吗
I thought we were speaking truth.

我上次来君临是很多年前了
The last time I was in the capital was many years ago.

那也是一场婚礼
Another wedding.

我姐姐伊莉亚
My sister Elia

嫁给雷加・坦格利安  最后的真龙传人
and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon.

我姐姐爱他  给他生下孩子
My sister loved him. She bore his children.

给他们裹被  哄他们睡觉  喂他们吃奶
Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast.

伊莉亚都不让乳母碰他们
Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.

而英俊高贵的雷加・坦格利安
And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen

抛下她另寻新欢
left her for another woman.

由此引发了一场战争
That started a war

而这场战争就在这里终结
and the war ended right here

在你父亲的军队占领君临之时
when your father's army took the city...

我并不在场
I wasn't actually present.

他们残忍地杀害了两个孩子
...and butchered those children.

我的外甥和外甥女
My nephew and niece.

将他们切成碎块  裹上兰尼斯特的斗篷
Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.

而我的姐姐  你知道他们对她做了什么吗
And my sister, you know what they did to her?

我在问你问题
I'm asking you a question.

我听过一些传闻
I've heard rumors.

我也是
So have I.

我最常听到的是魔山格雷果・克里冈
The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

强暴了伊莉亚  又用他的巨剑
raped Elia and split her in half

把她劈成了两半
with his great sword.

我不在场  我不知道发生了什么
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

如果杀我姐姐的是魔山
If the Mountain killed my sister,

下令的就是你父亲
your father gave the order.

告诉你父亲我来了
Tell your father I'm here.

顺便告诉他
And tell him the Lannisters

有债必还的不止兰尼斯特
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

它们是龙  卡丽熙
They're dragons, Khaleesi.

永远不会驯服
They can never be tamed.

即使是它们的母亲也没办法
Not even by their mother.

Where's Daario Naharis?

他们这样多久了
How long have they been at it?

从午夜开始  陛下
Since midnight, Your Grace.

虫子爵士比看起来要壮
Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.

但我看到他的胳膊开始打颤了
But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

赢得这场愚蠢的比试有什么奖励
What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?

胜者有幸在去弥林的路上骑行在您身旁
The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.

乔拉爵士和巴利斯坦爵士将与我同行
That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan

因为他们今早没有让我久等
as neither of them kept me waiting this morning.

你们俩个殿后  保护牲口
You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.

最后一个放下剑的人
The last man holding his sword

可以去找个新女王效命
can find a new queen to fight for.

膘满肉肥
and marbled.

叛国贼的野种

What would you expect?

断掌认为阻止曼斯的唯一机会
The Halfhand believed our only chance

就是我们派人打进他的军队内部
to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

别说得好像你很了解断掌一样
Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him.

他是我的兄弟
He was my brother.

那你就该知道他愿意为保护长城不惜一切
Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall.

自由民肯定会把他活煮了
The free folk would have boiled him alive,

但由我来杀他...

那你承认你违背了誓言
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

我承认
I do.

法律就是法律  这小子必须死

长城就得靠无头弟兄来守卫了
the Wall would be manned by headless men.

偷偷溜进鼹鼠村的妓院

为我坏了哪条规矩争论时
debating which rules I broke,

曼斯・雷德正带领十万大军向长城开进
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.

不可能
Impossible.

不等你把五十个野人凑在一起
You can't get 50 wildlings together

他们就开始自相残杀了
before they start killing each other.

是十万  他联合了瑟恩人
100,000. He's united the Thenns,

硬足部落  冰川部落
the Hornfoots, the iceriver clans.

还有巨人为他而战
He has giants fighting for him.

巨人
Giants?

你去过长城以外吗  爵士先生
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

我指挥过君临的都城守备队  小子
I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.

可如今你到了这儿

你好大胆子
How dare you?!

有一队野人已经攻进长城以南了
There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already

由巨人克星托蒙德率领
led by Tormund Giantsbane.

我杀了他们的易形者和另外三人

他们射了我满身箭
They shot me full of arrows.

他们奉命在曼斯从北边进攻时
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south

从南面攻击黑城堡
when Mance hits it from the north.

以篝火作为攻击信号
The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.

曼斯说那将是北境世所未见的大火
Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen.

这是事实
That's the truth.

全部的事实
All the truth.

你们是要处决我  还是放我自由离开
Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

我们都不自由
None of us are free.

我们是守夜人的汉子
We are men of the Night's Watch.

但我们今日不取你的脑袋  琼恩・雪诺
But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow.

走吧
Go on.

现在我是代理总司令  伊蒙学士
I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

对  你是
Yes, you are.

我不相信那个野种说的话
And I don't trust the bastard.

他说的是实话
He told the truth.

每次有人说谎你都能识破吗
And you always know when a man's telling a lie?

你这神奇的能力从何而来
How did you acquire this magical power?

因为我在君临长大
I grew up in King's Landing.

不行  不行
No. No.

你是王后  不是公牛
You're a queen, not an ox.

你祖父送了我一条项链  跟这条一模一样
Your grandfather gave me a necklace

作为我第五十一个命名日的礼物
just like this one for my 51st nameday.

还有两周就要举办婚礼了  祖母
The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.

您不能看到什么都说不行
You can't say no to everything.

胡说  我的小宝贝们
Nonsense. My little dears.

去找君临的宝石匠
Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing.

报出你们的身份  你们主子的身份
Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you.

谁给我带回的项链最好
The one who brings me the best necklace

第二好的项链就归她
will get to keep the next best.

两周后要步入大教堂的玛格丽・提利尔
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept

必将有千支歌谣为她传唱
a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs.

如果她戴着那样的破烂  该是多么悲哀呀
Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.

也许我应该让乔佛里替我挑
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me.

最后脖子上围一串死麻雀的脑袋
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

讲话要注意  即使是在这儿跟我说

哎哟喂
My word.

夫人  小姐
My lady. My lady.

请原谅我贸然打扰二位
Please pardon me for interrupting.

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

我们知道你是谁  我们都听说过你
We know who you are. We've heard all about you.

不过百闻不如一见
But hearing is one thing.

你还真叫人叹为观止
Aren't you just marvelous?

英武非凡
Absolutely singular.

我听说你把我那愣头青孙儿
I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt

摔得嘴啃泥
like the silly little boy he is.

小姐  我知道您现在很忙
My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you,

但能准许我跟您聊几句吗
but if I could just have a moment.

你哪敢拒绝
You dare not refuse.

他一剑刺穿蓝礼的心脏
He plunged his sword through Renly's heart

随即消失得无影无踪
and disappeared.

总有一天  小姐  我会为国王报仇雪恨
One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.

如今乔佛里才是国王
Joffrey is our king now.

我失言了
I meant no offense.

没有的事

告退  陛下

你想要下马步行跟在队伍最后吗
Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?

这束是仕女蕾丝 
And this one's called Lady's Lace.

你想要光脚步行吗

您要统治这里  就必须了解这里

这里的花草  河流

我派人先行一步  把他们埋了

您不需要看到这个

You will do no such thing.

把史塔克家的女孩送回母亲身边

可母亲已经死了
who is now dead.

保证她们的安全

Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed.

你觉得她在哪儿
Where do you think she is?

我赌她死了
My money's on dead.

死了就绝对安全了  你说呢
There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say?

而珊莎・史塔克如今成了珊莎・兰尼斯特
And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.

这就有点复杂了
Bit of a complication.

再怎么复杂  你也不能违背誓言
A complication does not release you from a vow.

你要我怎么做  绑架我的弟媳吗
What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sisterinlaw?

绑到哪儿去  她在哪儿能比在这里更安全
And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?

看着我的眼睛告诉我
Look me in the eye and tell me

你觉得她在君临会很安全
that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.

你真的不是我的亲戚吗
Are you sure we're not related?

自打我回来  见到的每个兰尼斯特
Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen

都要跟我过不去
has been a miserable pain in my ass.

说不定你也是个兰尼斯特
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

你有兰尼斯特的发色  模样倒不像
You've got the hair for it if not the looks.

没事的
It's all right.

别怕  别怕
It's all right. It's all right.

你醉了  对
 You're drunk.  Yes.

我有充足的理由喝醉

Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration.

抱歉  我该记得的

您没必要道歉

我虽是弄臣  但多亏您  我保住了性命
I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

换了别人也会这么做的
Anyone would have done the same.

但只有您真的做出了行动
But only you did.

您的大恩大德  我永世难报
I can never repay you.

thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

我不能接受
I can't take it.

你真好  但我不能接受
It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.

我现在一无所有
I don't have anything else left.

就剩下这个
That's all.

请您收下  戴上它
Take it. Wear it.

让我的姓氏在从世间消失之前
Let my name have one more moment in the sun

再沐浴一次阳光
before it disappears from the world.

我一定会骄傲地戴上  唐托斯爵士
I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.

好
Yeah.

我什么时候能有一匹马自个儿骑
When am I going to get a horse of my own?

小淑女想要一匹小马了
The little lady wants a pony.

小淑女不想再忍受你的臭味
