布兰登・史塔克
奈德和凯特琳的次子

梅拉・黎德梅拉・黎德
霍兰・黎德的女儿

疯王：烧死他们！
Burn them all!

奈德：我妹妹在哪？
Where's my sister?

疯王：烧死他们！
Burn them all!

动一下吧
Please.

疯王：烧了他们  都烧了！
Burn them. Burn them all!

疯王：烧死他们！
Burn them all!

梅拉
Meera.

他们发现我们了
They found us.

对不起
I'm so sorry.

跟我来  快点
Come with me, now.

尸鬼们可不休息
The dead don't rest.

都是绿色的呀
It's so green.

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人

啊 确实
Oh, yes.

等你到了河间地的南边
Once you get south of the Riverlands,

就会看到更多不同种类的树木
very different sorts of trees start to take over.

吉莉
卡斯特的“女儿”

枫树 榆树 山毛榉 杨树
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

还有奇怪的柳树
The odd willow.

还有 夏天快结束了
And of course now that summer's over,

秋色渐浓
you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.

不过这里的绿色还是比别处更多
Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.

你紧张了 你一紧张就话痨
You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.

一紧张就闭着嘴也不会好到哪去
That's not any better being a nervous mute.

我从没想到过我还会回到这
I didn't think I'd ever come back here

我父亲已经逼我放弃了爵位和继承权
after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance

呃 还威胁我 不那么做的话就杀了我
and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.

那时我就是个不受欢迎的人
A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.

我也压根没想到会把这小家伙介绍给我的家人
And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.

那么你应该知道怎样跟他们说
So you know what to tell them.

就说小山姆是你的孩子
That Little Sam is your baby.

对  这很重要
Yes, now that's very important.

如果他认同小山姆是他的孙子 那他就会接受你
If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in.

他会有人教导 识字读书
He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.

你也可以帮着教他 对吧？
And you can help teach him. Huh?

你都给你家人说了我的哪些情况？
What did you tell your family about me?

我告诉他们我在北境遇到了你
I told them I met you in the North.

说了有多北么？
Did you tell them how far north?

呃 信里面写不下那么多
Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.

你没告诉他们我真正的家乡？
You didn't tell them where I'm really from?

没说我是个野人？
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

问题是… 
The thing is...

我父亲不喜欢野人
my father doesn't like wildlings.

他希望我能够像男人一样"去杀掉混蛋野人"
He hoped I'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

所以这是一个尽可能要避免的话题
so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.

我… 觉得我们到了
I... think we're here.

梅丽莎・佛罗伦
山姆的母亲

山姆
Sam.

哦 山姆
Oh, Sam.

噢 你好 母亲
Oh, hello, Mother.

我以为再也见不到你了
I never thought I'd see you again.

你看起来很棒
You look wonderful.

塔拉？
Talla?

天呐 真是女大十八变
Gods, you're a woman now.

父亲说我必须嫁给西蒙・佛索威
Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.

塔拉・塔利
蓝道・塔利的女儿

 他牙齿是黄色的…    够了 塔拉
 He has yellow teeth...  That's enough, Talla.

对了 母亲 这是吉莉
Oh... Mother, this is Gilly.

噢 天呐
Oh, my.

你真可爱
You are lovely.

很荣幸能见到您 塔利夫人
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

哦  还有这个小家伙
Oh, and this,

这是我们的儿子 山姆威尔
this is our son Samwell.

你好啊 小家伙
Hello, little one.

是我 你的奶奶
It's me, your grandmother.

我能抱抱他么？
May I hold him?

当然可以
Yes, of course.

你好奇心很强 我看得出来
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

你会像你爸爸一样博览群书
You'll be a scholar like your father.

父亲在哪？
Where is Father?

狄肯呢？
And Dickon?

他们去打猎了
They're on a hunt.

他们会回来跟我们一起吃晚饭
They'll join us for dinner.

进来吧 这么远的路
Come inside. Such a journey.

你们肯定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

来 长途旅行之后都会想洗澡
Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.

噢 还有出席晚餐的衣服
Oh, and a dress for dinner.

你可以穿我的
You can wear one of mine.

你… 你喜欢什么颜色？
What's... what's your color?

深蓝还是银色？
Midnight blue or silver?

大概是银色？ 来
Silver, maybe. Come.

如果你需要的话 可以选一个我的卧室
You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.

没有别的办法了么？
Is there no other way?

你很怕她出事？
You're afraid for her?

我当然怕她出事！
Of course I'm afraid for her!

拖曼・拜拉席恩
七大王国国王

大麻雀
总主教

是因为好像这样做太危险
It just seems very dangerous.

她会被全程保护
She'll be protected the entire way.

教团武装对那些
The Faith Militant are very stern

越界的人非常严厉
with those who overstep their bounds.

而且玛格丽王后和你母亲不同
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

我觉得诸神可能会引导人们
I suspect the gods will predispose the common people

对她礼貌以待
to gentleness on her behalf.

她确实对他们敞开了真心
She's truly opened her heart to them.

她一直都致力于帮助那些贫穷和不幸的人们
She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.

而且她现在也笃信诸神
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.

您想见见她么？
Would you like to see her?

玛格丽・提利尔
七大王国的王后

他们伤害你了吗？
Have they hurt you?

有没有虐待你？
Have they mistreated you?

 没有 陛下    我想你
 No, Your Grace.  I've missed you.

比你想得还要多
More than you could know.

我们很快就能再次相聚
We'll be together again soon

一切都会比之前更好
and everything will be better than it was before.

怎么能更好？
Better how?

很快就是… 
Soon the...

救赎之路
walk of atonement.

他说了没有别的办法
He says there's no other way.

你跟他谈过吗 跟大麻雀？
Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?

是的 有过几次
Yes, a few times.

你呢？
Have you?

是的 我也有
Yes, I have.

他也不完全就是我们认为的那样  是吧？
He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?

你觉得我疯了
You think I'm mad.

我的话听起来很疯狂
I sound mad.

不 不 你没有
No. No, you don't.

你… 你永远不会
You... you could never.

你说得对 他不是
You're right, he's not.

他更有… 
He's a lot more...

正是如此
He is.

他有些不一样的经历
There's something about him.

他看这个世界的方式
His way of looking at the world.

承认真实的自我到底是什么确实不是一件简单的事情
It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.

这已经花了我好一阵子
It's taken me a while.

他帮了我
He's helped me.

你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

你是个好人 你一直都是好人
You're a good person. You've always been a good person.

你是我所知道的最好的人
You're the best person I know.

我只是告诉他你对穷人的帮助
I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.

啊  是的  我去过他们的住处
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

喂他们喝汤  确保别人看到我做过这些事情
and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.

但是 我从来都没有给过他们真正需要的东西
I never gave them what they really needed, though.

我想了很久 想到我给自己装扮上多么好看的伪装
I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.

我给自己讲的那些故事
All those stories I told myself about who I was

关于我是谁 我为什么要做这些事
and why I did the things I did.

那些故事里面有太多的谎言
There were so many lies in those stories.

我不懂
I don't understand.

没事 真没什么
It's all right. It really is.

卸下伪装就像卸下负担
It's such a relief to let go of those lies.

洛拉斯怎么样？
What about Loras?

我爱我弟弟
I love my brother.

永远都爱
I will always love my brother.

他的灵魂纯洁而完美
His soul is pure and perfect.

他的罪抹不去那种纯净
His sins don't erase that purity,

只是遮蔽了它
they only obscure it.

他只是需要 为他们赎罪
He just needs... to atone for them.

我们都是如此
We all do.

或早或晚 必有一劫
Sooner or later, one way or another.

诸神对我们都早有安排
The gods have a plan for us all.

穿着这个不好走路
It's hard to walk in this.

裙子好看
It's beautiful.

你真好看
You're beautiful.

蓝道・塔利
角陵伯爵

这鹿肉 很好吃
This venison, it's very tasty.

是今天猎到的吗？
Is it from today's hunt?

呃 不是
Well, no.

今天的我们还没处理好
We haven't been able to cure that one yet.

这是上周的
This is last week's.

哦 当然 很抱歉
Oh, of course. Sorry.

我们走了太久的路
Long journey.

我们从七十码外的地方
Brought it down from 70 yards.

一箭中的
One shot.

哦 那… 那可真是够远的
Oh, that's... that's a fair distance.

你在长城的时候经常打猎吗？
So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?

哦 是啊 没错
Oh, yes. Yes.

我经常去
A good amount.

在长城以北的地方
North of the Wall,

你不打猎就没得吃
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

猎物大多是鹿吧？也是麋鹿？
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

主要是兔子
Rabbits.

有些时候会打松鼠
Sometimes squirrels.

我说的“我们”主要是指我和我朋友琼恩
I say "we," it's my friend Jon mostly.

有时艾迪也会去
Sometimes Edd.

哦 还有吉莉
Oh, and Gilly.

她… 她也是个相当棒的猎手
She's... she's quite a good hunter as well.

女猎手
Huntress.

我觉得在你的家乡这应该挺常见的
I imagine it's common where you're from.

我们遇到过最后壁炉城的安柏大人 对吧 蓝道
We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

他说他教自己所有的女儿打猎
who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.

你父亲教你打猎的？
Your father taught you to hunt?

我们的父亲可永远都不会这么做
Our father would never teach us.

我猜没准他能从你父亲身上学点东西
I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.

到此为止
That's enough of that.

山姆威尔 你还想再来点面包吗？
Samwell, would you care for more bread?

哦 是的 要的 谢谢
Oh, yes. Yes, please.

谢谢您 母亲
Thank you, Mother.

你还嫌自己不够胖吗？
Not fat enough already?

我是奉总司令大人的命令来到南方的
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.

 他想让我…   我读了你的信
 He wants me to...  I read your letter.

你想要当学士
You're to be a maester.

是的
Yes.

一旦我拥有了自己的颈链
And once I have my chain,

便会回到黑城堡
I'll return to Castle Black.

我以为守夜人会把你变成一个真男人
I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.

至少也该有点男人的模样
Something resembling a man at least.

结果你却依旧如此软弱 胖得不行
You managed to stay soft and fat.

就知道一头扎进书堆
Your nose buried in books.

一辈子都在阅读更优秀的人所取得的成就
Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.

我敢打赌你还是骑不上马 挥不动剑
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.

蓝道 成为守夜人的学士是很高的荣誉
Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.

他能挥剑
He can wield a sword.

他曾杀死一个瑟恩人
He killed a Thenn.

还杀死过一个异鬼
He killed a white walker.

根本没有异鬼这种东西
There's no such thing.

在南下黑城堡的路上 我亲眼所见
I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.

他把一柄匕首捅进了异鬼的心脏
He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.

他不止一次冒着生命危险救我
He risked his own life to save mine more than once.

他是一名战士 取得的成就是你们一辈子都得不到的
He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.

你南下黑城堡的路上？
Your way down to Castle Black?

他在哪儿杀死异鬼的？
Where did he kill a white walker?

你从哪儿来？
Where are you from?

你是怎么遇到我儿子的？
How'd you come to meet my son?

守夜人去了我们的堡垒
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

 哪儿的堡垒？  吉莉
 Where?  Gilly.

 长城以北  长城以北？
 North of the Wall.  North of the Wall?

你是个野人
You're a wildling.

近几个世纪以来 七大王国都在抵抗这些野蛮人的入侵
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries

而我却在家里盛情款待他们中的一个
and here I sit hosting one in my hall

真是多亏了我的好儿子
thanks to my son.

看见那把剑了吗？
See that sword?

它叫“碎心”
It's called Heartsbane.

已经在我们家族流传了五百多年
It's been in our family for 500 years.

它是瓦雷利亚钢剑
It's Valyrian steel.

全世界也没有几把留存了
Only a handful of them left in the world.

在我死后 它理应由我的长子继承
It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.

由他继承
To him.

但他永远也别想得到这把剑
He will never wield that sword.

如果他成为了角陵的塔利伯爵
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

那将会是这个家族的末日
it would be the end of this house.

我见到你的时候以为你是个鼹鼠村的妓女
I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you

然后我接受了这个事实
and I made my peace with that.

有什么人会爱上他？
Who else would have him?

但我真是高估了他
But I overestimated him.

不
No.

一个野人婊子诱惑了我儿子
It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

你这是在报复我吗 小子？
This you getting back at me, boy?

把那东西带到我的餐桌上 让它和我共进晚餐？
Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?

你得到了自己一直想要的 对吗？
And you got what you were after, didn't you?

一个私生子 一个血统不正的私生子
A bastard. A half breed bastard.

作为你回家的邀请函
Your invitation into our home.

来吧 亲爱的 塔拉
Come, my dear. Talla.

我吃不下去了
I've lost my appetite.

他丢了我们家族的脸
He dishonors us.

你丢了你自己的脸
You dishonor yourself.

你母亲心地善良 你不配做她的儿子
Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.

为了让她开心 我会留下那野人 她可以在厨房打杂
To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens.

你的私生子也可以由我们抚养
The bastard will be raised here.

但今晚会是你这辈子在角陵的最后一个晚上
But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.

我很抱歉让他这样对待你
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.

我害怕他会赶走你和小山姆
I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.

我并不生你的气
I'm not angry at you.

让我生气的是那些可怕的人
I'm angry that horrible people

他们那样对待好人却不受到任何惩罚
can treat good people that way and get away with it.

你什么时候离开？
When do you have to go?

天一亮就得走
First light.

替我向他道别
Say good bye to him for me.

你不是他所说的那样 山姆
You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.

他并不了解你是什么样的人
He doesn't know what you are.

再见 吉莉
Good bye, Gilly.

 山姆？  我们该走了
 Sam?  We're leaving.

 什么？  收拾好东西
 What?  Get your things.

我什么东西也没有
I don't have any things.

 你在干什么啊？  我们应该在一起
 What are you doing?  We belong together.

我们三个
All of us.

你母亲和妹妹怎么办？
What about your mother and sister?

哦 她们会理解的
Oh, they'll understand.

我还穿着你妹妹的裙子呢
Your sister's dress.

她不会介意的
She won't mind.

反正你穿着更好看
Looks better on you anyway.

山姆
Sam.

那是你父亲的剑
That's your father's sword.

这是我家族的剑
It's my family's sword.

山姆
Sam.

他不会来找剑吗？
Won't he come for it?

那就让他来啊
He can bloody well try.

狮子与玫瑰已合而为一
The lion and the rose are one.

为此我感谢天上的神碉
I thank the gods above.

而你 我美丽动人的新娘
And to you, my beauteous bride,

我宣誓我的爱至死不渝
I pledge undying love.

乔佛里国王万岁 玛格丽王后万岁
Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.

我将向我的新后祝酒致敬
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

没有什么比这更加合情
for there is no one fairer.

亲爱的舅舅 你愿分享我的喜悦 做我的御用斟酒人吗？
Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?

大口喝吧 我尊贵的国王
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

艾莉亚・史塔克
“无名之辈”

尽情享受这杯香甜佳酿
from this cup of sweet wine.

这将是他人生的最后一口
The last drink he shall ever take.

而我则会迎来美妙的复仇
And vengeance shall be mine.

毒药！
Poison!

谋杀！
Murder!

我无法喘息 我… 我将死去
I gasp. I... I die.

我无法站立
I limp.

就是那人… 
And it was he...

他毒杀了我
...that poisoned me.

我邪恶的舅舅小恶魔
My evil Uncle Imp.

冷静下来 亲爱的
Calm down, dear.

我的初生子
My firstborn son.

我的小金狮
My golden lion

被无礼 粗暴地害死
foully, falsely slain.

我祈祷你能享有永久的宁静
I pray you found a lasting peace

永不再陷入斗争与痛病
free from strife and pain.

残酷的诸神啊 听我诉说
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

请带走我来换取他的重生
Take my life instead.

若我心爱的孩子已经死去 哪怕一天我也难以支撑
For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.

灾祸啊
Oh, woe.

不幸啊
Oh, grief.

最黑暗的日子啊 我的内心充满了悲伤
Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.

所有的希望都已离去
All hope is lost.

所有的欢乐都已消散
All joy is gone.

仿佛明日将不会降临这个世上
And there is no tomorrow.

什么声音？什么味道？
What is that I hear and smell?

我就要送那人踏上地狱之道
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

他们说泰温・兰尼斯特拉出的都是黄金
It's time to see if truth they told

是时候来看看他们是不是在骗人
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

你这畜牲 你这畜牲
You beast. You beast.

你杀了我妻 现在又将你父亲置于死地
You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.

不曾有比你更恶毒的子女玷污过这片土地
No worse child ever stained this land.

我诅咒我命名你的那日
Curse the day I named you.

这是我罪恶之极 现在我必须逃离
My greatest crime. Now I must flee.

到狭海彼岸之地
Then sail across the Narrow Sea

将更多背叛送抵
to do unto you more treachery.

论可怕 寒冬怎与我相比！
Don't fear winter. Fear me!

没什么
Nothing.

那天观众里也有你

三次
Three times.

I remember when the players came to my village.

我没有钱 于是我偷偷溜了进去
I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.

就像你一样
Just like you.

我看到上了妆的脸 戏服
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

听了歌
listened to the songs,

在年轻的恋人相拥而死时痛哭
cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.

第二天 我离家加入了他们 从此再未回头
I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.

你演得很精彩
You're very good.

我最后那段独白像屎一样
My final speech is shit.

但就像我经常说的 也是摸着良心说的
But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be,

剧本写得不好
the writing's no good.

那就别按它来
So change it.

没有你的话 他们不过就是在放屁打嗝 打打闹闹
It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.

你想怎么改？
How would you change it?

王太后爱她的孩子 胜过一切
The queen loves her son more than anything.

他被夺走生命 她却不及告别
And he was taken from her before she could say good bye.

她不会只是哭泣
She wouldn't just cry.

她会满腔愤怒
She would be angry.

她要杀死谋杀她儿子的人
She would want to kill the person who did this to her.

你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

茉慈

你有双会说话的眼睛 茉慈
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

好看的眉毛
Wonderful eyebrows.

醉醺醺的可爱
Drunkenly sweet.

奈德死的时候没人笑
No laugh for Ned's death.

这些人真是比动物还蠢

But they loved her. They all love her.

是啊 你人兽通吃啊
Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.

我只是善用天赋 尽己所能
I do what I can with what I'm given.

用你的天赋？
With what you're given?

额 我在想… 
Well, I was thinking...

哦 现在我们都是思想家了 是么？
Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

奶头里都是想法
Full to the tits with ideas.

 我不是说… 你有个想法 我有个想法
 I didn't mean...  You have ideas, I have ideas,

他也有个想法
he has ideas.

为什么我的想法比你们的更有价值？
Why should my ideas have any more value than yours

就因为我一辈子都在干这个
simply because I've been doing this my whole life?

谁想来评判我的工作？
Who is anyone to judge my work?

这是我的专业 我知道我在做什么
This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.

你没有权利拥有想法
You have no right to an opinion.

小心那个人
Careful of that one.

她想要你死

如何？
And?

如我所料

贾昆・赫加尔

可惜了
A shame.

女孩很有天赋
A girl had many gifts.

你答应我的

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫

梅斯・提利尔
高庭公爵

全体立定！
Company, halt!

大人
My lord.

大人
My lord.

朋友们 是时候了
My friends, the hour has come.

疯狂已经占领了这座城市
Madness has overtaken this city

置我的孩子于它的魔爪之下
and grasped in its claws my children.

但现在我们必须将它赶走
But now we must drive it back

让它从哪来就回哪去
under the rocks whence it came.

疯狂已到尽头！
Madness has had its day!

齐步走！
Forward, march!

富贵抑或贫穷 高尚抑或平庸
Rich or poor, noble or common,

一旦有罪 皆需赎罪
if we sin, we must atone.

提利尔家族的玛格丽
Margaery of House Tyrell

以罪人之身至此
came to us a sinner.

她在圣堂中面对诸神 撒了谎
She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied.

她对其弟犯下的罪行视若无睹
She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.

她令她的家族蒙羞
She disgraced her house,

令国王蒙羞 令自己蒙羞
her king, and herself.

奥莲娜・雷德温
荆棘女王

全体立定！

向前
Face front!

向左转！
Turn!

提利尔大人
Lord Tyrell.

詹姆爵士
Ser Jaime.

抱歉打断
Sorry to interrupt.

我们为玛格丽王后和洛拉斯・提利尔爵士而来
We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.

把他们交出来 否则我们不客气
Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

我无权把他们交给你们
I don't have the authority to give them to you.

而你们也无权把他们带走
And you don't have the authority to take them.

对啊
That's right.

执矛！
Lock spears!

我代表拜拉席恩家族的托曼一世国王
I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.

诸神并不认为他有权处理此事
The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.

你已经侮辱了一个大家族
You've already insulted one great house.

不会再有第二个
It won't happen twice.

玛格丽・提利尔若走下这条街道
Every last sparrow will die

我就把所有麻雀都杀光
before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.

因侍奉诸神而死
To die in the service of the gods

我们每个人都会倍感欣慰
would please each and every one of us.

我们渴望如此
We yearn for it.

兰赛尔・兰尼斯特
凯冯之子

但我们今天不必如此
But there is no call for it today.

今天不会有赎罪游街
There will be no walk of atonement.

列队！
Order up.

玛格丽王后已经赎罪
Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins

她已将另一人
by bringing another

带入七神的光芒之下
into the true light of the Seven.

我们一同宣布
Together we announce

迎来一个崭新的和谐时代
a new age of harmony.

迎来王权和神权的
A holy alliance

神圣同盟
between the Crown and the Faith.

托曼国王万岁 愿诸神保佑你 玛格丽王后
Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!

王权和神权
The Crown and the Faith

是这个世界的两大支柱
are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.

我们将一同恢复七国的荣耀
Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

怎么回事？
What's happening?

我们被耍了
He's beaten us.

就是这么回事
That's what's happening.

你跟教会作对 就是跟国王作对
When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.

任何跟国王作对的人
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

都不适合担任御林铁卫
to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

从你出生之前我一直是御林铁卫
I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.

你不必如此 你不必做任何事
You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.

我必须给诸神交代
I have to answer to the gods.

坐在上王位的人不用给教会任何交代
Not when you're sitting in that chair.

此事的决定没有回旋余地
The Crown's decision on this matter is final.

那你要我脱光了游街吗？
Will I be walking naked in the streets?

凯冯・兰尼斯特
国王之手

还是说我会在圣堂地牢里待上几个月
Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first

教教我什么叫诸神的仁慈？
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

你已经忠诚地侍奉你的家族和国王很多年了
You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.

你将继续如此
And you will continue to do so.

但不是在君临
But not in this city.

你丢掉了它？
You've lost it?

是的 父亲
Yes, Father.

那是座城堡 不是他妈的绵羊
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

瓦德・佛雷
孪河城侯爵

你还知道它在哪儿吧
Presumably you still know where it is.

你不是弄丢了奔流城
You didn't lose Riverrun.

而是让黑鱼抢去了
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

他突袭我们 他比任何人都熟悉那座城堡
He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.

红色婚礼之后 你的确把黑鱼弄丢了
You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.

他就在这个大厅里 你却让他给跑了
You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.

我让你去抓住他 杀掉他
Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him,

你却连人影都没找到
you couldn't find him.

这才叫弄丢了
That's what it means to lose something.

如今他回来了 还抢去了奔流城
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

我不觉得应该怪我们
I don't think it's fair to blame us...

三百年来 我们一直在亲徒利家的靴子
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

向他们和他们那臭烘烘的鳟鱼旗子誓忠
swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.

再也不能这样了 奔流城是我们的
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

给我抢回来！
Take it back!

我们人手不够
We don't have the men.

我们的人手是那条死鱼的十倍
We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.

梅利斯特家族叛变了 布莱伍德家族也是
The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.

无旗兄弟会在召集平民造反
The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us,

袭击我们的补给车队和营地
raiding our supply trains and camps.

奔流城经得住一年的围攻
Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.

如果你们只提得出借口 不如让她来管事
If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.

他们在嘲笑我们
They're laughing at us.

整个河间地
All across the Riverlands

直到君临
right down to King's Landing,

都在嘲笑我们
they're laughing at us.

我睡觉的时候都听得见！
I hear it in my sleep!

你们真是不走运 我还没死呢
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

在他们把自己的嘲笑吞回去噎死之前  我绝不咽气
And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.

把城堡夺回来
Take that castle back.

他不会投降的 父亲
He'll never yield, Father.

哦 他会的
Oh, he'll yield.

你把你那把刀拿给他看
You'll show him the knife you used

那把刀杀了罗柏・史塔克的婊子肚子里的孩子
to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,

你也把你的刀拿出来
and you'll show him the knife you used

那把割了他侄女喉咙的刀
to open his niece's throat.

然后你们给他提提醒
And you'll remind him who it was

红色婚礼是为谁办的婚礼
that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.

是为他侄子
His nephew.

艾德慕・徒利
徒利家族现任当家  河间地统治者

开心点 艾德慕大人
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

你要回家了
You're going home.

我被派去对付黑鱼
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.

瓦德・佛雷显然没法自己应付
Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own

因为他都四百岁了
because he's 400 years old.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

给我一支军队去河间地
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands

围城估计得持续几个月
and a siege that could last months.

去外地带兵
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army

总比被抓进圣堂的地牢好
than in the sept dungeons.

我不会去河间地的
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

那你想干嘛？
What, then?

我要给波隆备下世人不敢想象的巨额酬金
I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen

让他召集最好的杀手
and have him gather the best killers he knows.

然后我带他们去大圣堂 砍掉大麻雀的头
I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head

砍掉所有麻雀的头
and every other sparrow head I can find.

 你不能这么做  他抢走了我们的儿子！他偷走了我们的儿子！
 You can't.  He has our son! He stole our son!

他在分裂我们的家族
He's torn our family apart.

我们该如何处置那些分裂我们的人？
How should we treat people who tear us apart?

绝不放过他们 不给他们任何慈悲
We should treat them without mercy and we will.

但如果你杀了大麻雀 你不会活着离开圣堂的
But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.

而没有你 一切都毫无意义
And without you, this is all for nothing.

立于军队之首 那是属于你的位置
Stand at the head of our army where you belong,

也是父亲想要你在的位置
where Father wanted you.

让我们的人看清楚 他们应该向谁效忠
Show our men where their loyalties belong.

让他们看看兰尼斯特家族的样子
Show them what Lannisters are,

和我们处置敌人的手段
what we do to our enemies.

把那个愚蠢的小城堡夺回来
And take that stupid little castle back

因为它是我们的 因为你做得到
because it's ours and because you can.

你马上要接受审判了 我得守着你
You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.

那会是一场比武审判
It will be a trial by combat.

而我有魔山
I have the Mountain.

他们这些人 只能让我们更强大
They've made us both stronger, all of them.

他们不知道我们有多强大
They have no idea how strong we are.

不知道等待他们的是什么下场
No idea what we're going to do to them.

我们一直在一起
We've always been together.

也会永远在一起
We'll always be together.

全世界只有我俩
We're the only two people in the world.

你为什么帮我们？
Why did you help us?

三眼乌鸦派我来的
The Three Eyed Raven sent for me.

三眼乌鸦死了
The Three Eyed Raven's dead.

如今他已获重生
Now he lives again.

我上次见到你的时候 你还是个孩子
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

无所畏惧的孩子
A fearless boy.

最喜欢爬城墙 把他的母亲吓得不轻
Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.

你是谁？
Who are you?

班扬叔叔
Uncle Benjen.

班扬・史塔克
前守夜人首席游骑兵

琼恩最后一次来信说
The last letter Jon wrote me

你在长城之外失踪了
said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

我带领一队游骑兵深入北方
I led a ranging party deep into the North

寻找白鬼的踪迹
to find white walkers.

结果它们找到了我们
They found us.

一个白鬼用冰剑捅了我的肚子
A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.

留下我等死
Left me there to die.

慢慢转化
To turn.

森林之子发现了我
The Children found me.

阻止了异鬼的魔法
Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.

怎么阻止的？
How?

和他们当初造出异鬼的方法一样
The same way they made the walkers in the first place.

你自己也看到了
You saw it yourself.

龙晶
Dragonglass.

一片龙晶刺入心脏
A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.

现在你成为了三眼乌鸦
You are the Three Eyed Raven now.

我没时间去学 我什么都控制不了
I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.

在夜王到来之前
You must learn to control it

你必须学会控制
before the Night King comes.

喝吧
Drink.

他总会找到办法
One way or another,

攻入人类世界
he will find his way to the world of men.

当他到来时
When he does,

你会在等候着他
you will be there waiting for him.

你要做好准备
And you will be ready.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生” 弥林的女王

一切还好吗？
Everything all right?

达里奥・纳哈里斯
雇佣兵

到弥林还要骑多少天？
How many days' ride to Meereen?

最快一周
A week at best.

把我的卡拉萨带回维斯特洛需要多少艘船？
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?

多斯拉克人以及他们的马
Dothraki and all their horses,

无垢者 次子团… 
the Unsullied, the Second Sons...

至少需要一千艘船
a 1,000 ships easily.

 或许更多  谁有那么多艘船？
 Probably more.  And who has that many?

没人有
Nobody.

只是暂时而已
Nobody yet.

所以我们骑马回弥林 然后启航去维斯特洛
So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.

然后呢？
And what then?

我会把属于我的东西夺回来
I take what is mine.

你不适合坐在宫殿里的王位上
You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.

那我适合做什么？
What was I made for?

你是个征服者 风暴降生的丹妮莉丝
You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

在这等着
Wait here.

我去找她

在这儿等我

卓耿
丹妮的黑龙

从古至今 所有的卡奥都会选择三名血盟卫

和他并肩作战 守护他

但我不是卡奥

我不会选择三名血盟卫

你们都是我的血盟卫

我对我的卡拉萨的期望

也比其他任何卡奥更多！

你们愿意和我一起骑着木马横渡黑色咸水吗？

你们愿意为我杀死穿铁衣服的敌人

并拆了他们的石头房子吗？

你们愿意为我夺回七国吗？

那份卓戈卡奥曾在圣母山前

许诺给我的礼物？

你们会拥戴我

从今天

直到永远吗？
