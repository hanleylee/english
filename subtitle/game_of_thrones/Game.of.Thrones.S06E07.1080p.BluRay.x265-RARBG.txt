对 放到顶上
That's it. Get it right to the top.

稳住 稳住
Steady. Steady.

好了
Up she goes.

来吧 再加把劲儿
Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?

给你 孩子
Here you are, son.

哦 先生们 这边请 往右走
Oh, gentlemen, please. To my right.

还有你们 加油 不要停下来
And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving.

快点 快点
Come on, come on.

根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》 改编

第六季第七集   the Broken Man
残人

我活了这么多年 还从没见过一个人能像你这样挥动斧头
In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.

桑铎・克里冈
“猎狗”

得多少人才能把你撂倒？
How many men did it take to cut you down?

只需要一个
Just one.

他一定是个怪物
He must have been some kind of monster.

是个女的
He was a woman.

雷伊
七神教会的兄弟

我想有些人有点怕你
I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.

我习惯了
I'm used to it.

当我发现你时 以为你已经死了好几天
When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days.

身体发臭
The way you were stinking already

上面都是虫子
and you had bugs all over you

骨头也露出来了
and bone was coming through right there.

我还想着要给你个体面的葬礼呢 你却突然开始咳嗽
I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.

差点给我吓出屎来
Oh, nearly shit myself.

把你放到马车上时
I reckoned you were gonna die

我以为你会死 可你没有
by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't.

在接下来的几天里 我觉得你一定会死个十几回
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days,

可你没有 是什么让你活了下来？
but you didn't. What kept you going?

仇恨
Hate.

不 你还待在这儿是有原因的
No, there's a reason you're still here.

是啊 是有原因的 我是个大浑蛋 很难被杀死
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.

不 万事皆有因
No, a reason.

诸神还不准备收了你
Gods aren't done with you yet.

我以前听说过这话
I've heard that before.

不过那人谈的是别的神
Man was talking about a different god, though.

也许他是对的
Well, maybe he was right.

我不太了解神
I don't know much about the gods.

你入错行了
You're in the wrong line of work.

哦 有很多虔诚的王八蛋
Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches

他们以为自己了解上帝或神的话
who think they know the word of god or gods.

我不了解 我甚至不知道惦们真正的名字
I don't. I don't even know their real names.

也许是七神 也许是旧神
Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods.

也许是光之王
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

也许他们都他妈是一种东西
Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.

我不知道
I don't know.

我认为 最重要的
What matters, I believe,

是有些事物比我们自身伟大得多
is that there's something greater than us.

不管是什么 惦对桑铎・克里冈有自己的打算
And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.

你不了解过去的我
You didn't know me back in my time.

你不了解我做过的事
You don't know the things I've done.

我听过一些故事
I've heard stories.

如果诸神真的存在
If the gods are real...

惦们为什么没有惩罚我？
why haven't they punished me?

惦们已经惩罚了
They have.

玛格丽・提利尔
七大王国的王后

殿下
Your Grace.

大麻雀
总主教

今天我们读什么？
What are we reading today?

圣母之书 总主教大人
The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.

第三章 第12节
Chapter three, verse 12.

“当流水平滑地包围石头… ”
Ah, "As water rounds the stones, smoothing..."

“可以磨平石头 一个女人的爱同样可以
"Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love

抚平一个男人的残暴天性
calm a man's brute nature.

妻子抚平丈夫的伤痛
A wife salves her husband's wounds,

慈母的歌声让儿子睡着”
a mother sings her son to sleep."

您学得很快
You learn quickly.

有些人知道神圣文本里的每一节内容
There are some who know every verse of the sacred text,

但他们的血液里没有圣母的一丝怜悯
but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood

而根本不会阅读的野蛮人
and savages who can't read at all

却理解圣父的智慧
who understand the Father's wisdom.

多年来 我假装
For years I pretended

爱穷人 爱那些受折磨的人
to love the poor, the afflicted.

我同情他们 但我从未爱过他们
I had pity for them, but I never loved them.

我厌恶他们
They disgusted me.

很难去爱他们
They are hard to love.

穷人使我们厌恶 因为他们就是我们
The poor disgust us because they are us,

只是被剥夺了我们拥有的幻想
shorn of our illusions.

他们展示了我们褪去漂亮衣服的样子
They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.

我们没用香水时的味道
How'd we smell without perfume.

我可以问您一个私人问题吗？
Can I ask you about a personal matter?

当然
Of course.

国王提到自从你们重聚
The king mentioned that since your reunion,

您还没有睡上他的婚床
you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.

没有
No.

殿下 您有职责
You have a duty, Your Grace.

无论是对您的丈夫 您的国王 您的国家
To your husband, your king, your country,

还是对您信仰的神
to the gods themselves.

只是… 
It's just...

曾经的欲望一去不返
the desires that once drove me no longer do.

国会不需要女人有欲望
Congress does not require desire

只要求女人有耐心
on the woman's part, only patience.

国王必须有继承人
The king must have an heir

如果我们还想继续我们的事业
if we are to continue our good work.

原谅我
Forgive me.

有时很难找到真正的道路
Sometimes the true path is hard to find.

很难找到
Hard to find

更难走
and harder still to walk upon.

但你已经取得了很大的进步
But you've made great progress.

我只祈祷你祖母能紧随你的脚步
I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.

我的祖母？
My grandmother?

是的
Yes.

荆棘女王是个了不起的女人
The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman,

一个坚强的女人
a strong woman,

也是一个不思悔改的罪人
and an unrepentant sinner.

你必须教她新的方式
You must teach her the new way

就像她曾教你老的方式
as she taught you the old.

否则我会担心她的安全
Or I fear for her safety,

身心安全
body and soul.

乌尼亚
修女

它会动 会说话吗？
Does it move or talk?

我想和你单独谈话
I want to speak with you alone.

奥莲娜・雷德温
荆棘女王

乌尼亚修女一直是我真正的朋友和顾问
Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.

哦 这太疯狂了！
Oh, this is madness!

你现在不是在你的圣所 亲爱的
You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.

我只需要吹个口哨 我的人就会到这儿来 给你一顿海扁… 
All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...

祖母 直到我叫停为止
Grandmother. Until I tell them to stop.

如果我让他们停下的话
If I tell them to stop.

真该打你一顿 奶奶 求您了
You could use a good bashing. Grandmother, please.

他们对你做了什么？
What have they done to you?

你们向大麻雀进军
You marched against the High Sparrow,

反对教团 我们是为了你才出兵的
against the Faith. We marched for you.

诸神原本会惩罚您和父亲 但他们没有
The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't.

他们很仁慈 你弟弟怎么办？
They showed mercy. And what about your brother?

他们给了他什么样的仁慈？
What mercy did they show him?

洛拉斯唯一的希望就是认罪 忏悔
Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.

如果他这样做了 教团便会允许他回到高庭
If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden.

他将放弃名字和爵位… 
He'll have to renounce his name and title...

你疯了吗？ 作为一个忏悔者生活
Have you lost your mind? And live his life as a penitent.

他是高庭的继承人  提利尔家族的未来
He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.

他可以重新开始
He can begin again.

作为一个盲目的狂热分子
As a mindless fanatic.

作为一个自由人
As a free man.

你今天就回高庭
You will leave for Highgarden today.

没有法律规定你必须待在这儿
There is no law that says you must stay here.

我是王后
I am the queen.

我有责任侍奉我的丈夫 他是国王
It is my duty to serve my husband the king.

但您应该离开 奶奶
But you should leave, Grandmother.

您应该待在家里
Your place is at home.

我决不会离开你 决不
I will never leave you. Never.

您必须离开
You must.

回家吧
Go home.

在祈祷和善行中找到安慰
Find comfort in prayer and good works.

圣母照看着所有人
The Mother watches over us all.

希望能尽早再见 亲爱的
I'll see you soon, my dear.

七神保佑您 奶奶
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

我们开始祈祷吧？
Shall we pray?

我们说过会和你并肩战斗 乌鸦王
We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,

只等时机成熟 我们是认真的
when the time comes and we meant it,

但这和我们说好的不一样
but this isn't what we agreed to.

这些不是白鬼
These aren't white walkers.

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令

珊莎・史塔克
艾德和凯特琳的长女

这不是死亡军团
This isn't an army of the dead.

这不是我们要打的仗
This isn't our fight.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
洋葱骑士

如果没有他 我们不会站在这里
If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.

"旺旺"
巨人

你们都会成为夜王军队里的臭肉
All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.

托蒙德
野人头领

我将是一堆烧焦的骨头 就像曼斯
And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.

还记得曼斯的营地吗？
Remember Mance's camp?

它一直延伸到地平线
It stretched all the way to the horizon.

现在看看我们
And look at us now.

看看我们剩下的人
Look what's left of us.

如果输了这一仗 我们就完了
And if we lose this, we're gone.

数十部族 数百代人
Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.

就像从未出现过一样
Be like we were never there at all.

我们将是最后的自由民
We'll be the last of the free folk.

如果我们输了 这将是你们的下场
That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

波顿家族 卡史塔克家族 安柏家族
The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,

他们知道你们在这
they know you're here.

知道其中有一多半是妇孺
They know that more than half of you are women and children.

干掉我之后 他们会来对付你们
After they finish with me, they'll come for you.

你说的对
You're right.

这不是你们的战斗
This isn't your fight.

你们不必随我去临冬城
You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.

我不该要求你们
I shouldn't be asking you.

我们之前不是这么说的
It's not the deal we made.

但要想打败他们 我需要你们的帮助
I need you with me if we're going to beat them,

如果你们想活下来 我们则必须打败他们
and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.

乌鸦们杀了他 就因为他替自由民说话
The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk

其他南方人不会这样
when no other southerners would.

他曾为我们而死
He died for us.

如果我们不为他做同样的事 那和懦夫有什么区别
If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.

如果我们就是懦夫
And if that's what we are,

那自由民活该终于我们之手
we deserve to be the last of the free folk.

雪诺
Snow.

你能确定他们会来么？
Are you sure they'll come?

我们不像你们南方人那么油滑
We're not clever like you southerners.

我们说什么 就是什么
When we say we'll do something, we do it.

我听说您要离开君临了
I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

这可跟你没什么关系
That is hardly your concern.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
太后

您的孙子还是个阶下囚
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

您准备离开他 让他烂在监牢里么？
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

洛拉斯烂在监牢里都是因为你
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

大麻雀统治着这个城市 是因为你
The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.

我们两个古老的家族正面临崩溃 也是因为你
Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you

以及你的愚蠢
and your stupidity.

您说的对
You're right.

我犯了一个严重的错误
I made a terrible mistake.

每天我都在提醒自己
I carry it with me every single day.

很好
Good.

我给自己家门口送来一批狂热分子
I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.

现在我们必须同仇敌忾
And now we must fight them together.

我们需要彼此
We need each other.

我在想你是不是我见过的最差劲的人
I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.

已经这把年纪 我也想不起来了
At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

不过这么多年来你确实作恶多端
But the truly vile do stand out through the years.

你还记得我的孙子和孙女被拽到监牢里的时候
Do you remember the way you smirked at me

你是怎么冲着我幸灾乐祸的么？
when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?

我记得 我永远不会忘
I do. I'll never forget it.

您爱您的孙女
You love your granddaughter.

我爱我的儿子
I love my son.

这是我唯一确定的事
It's the only truth I know.

我们必须保护他们
We must defend them.

我可得赶紧离开这个可悲的城市
I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can

省得被那些光脚的狂热分子扔进他们的监狱
before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.

如果你有你自己想的一半那么聪明的话
If you're half as bright as you think you are,

你也会离开这里的
you'll find a way out of here, too.

绝不
Never.

我绝不会离开我的儿子
I'll never leave my son.

那你能怎么办？
What'll you do, then?

不像以前了 你没有支援了
You have no support. Not anymore.

你弟弟已经走了 这一点大麻雀已经料理好了
Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.

你家族的其他人都已经抛弃了你
The rest of your family have abandoned you.

人民鄙视你
The people despise you.

你被成千上万的敌人包围
You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them.

你想凭自己杀光他们么？
You're going to kill them all by yourself?

你已经输了 瑟曦
You've lost, Cersei.

这是我在这一切的苦难中能找到的唯一乐趣了
It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.

加快速度
Pick the pace up.

继续走
Keep going.

快走！
Keep it moving!

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫

波隆
骑士

看吧 这样的围城毫无意义
Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.

得有人教教这帮可悲的娘们怎么挖战壕
Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.

是得有人教啊
Someone certainly does.

不不 别看我
Oh, no. Not me.

我只是个瞎蹦垩的雇佣剑士
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

你是涂过圣油的骑士 完全两回事
You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.

是啊 当骑士可没有报酬
Aye, knights don't get paid.

你的军事才能胜过兰尼斯特军队的任何军官
You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.

这就跟说我的那话儿比无垢者军队里任何人都大差不多
That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.

我希望不久之后可以统领所有的兰尼斯特军队
I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.

你可以成为我失去的右手
You can be the right hand I lost.

你答应给我一个爵位 一座城堡
You promised me a lordship and a castle

还能娶一位出身高贵的美女
and a highborn beauty for a wife.

这三样你都得到了 兰尼斯特有债… 
And you'll get all three. A Lannister always...

别说了 别他娘的说了
Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

出来跟我们打啊 黑鱼
Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

罗索・佛雷
“跛子罗索”

艾德慕大人在我们手上
We have Lord Edmure.

艾德慕・徒利
徒利家族现任当家  河间地统治者

瓦德・佛雷
“黑瓦德”

把城交出来 不然我们绞死他
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

布林登・徒利
“黑鱼”

这是最后通牒
This is your last warning.

把城交出来
Yield the castle.

你以为我不敢吗 老头？
You think I won't do it, old man?

是我一刀抹了你侄女的喉咙 划个半张脸大的口子
I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.

可你却跑哪去了？跟他妈胆小鬼似的躲来躲去
And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.

交出城来 不然我连他的喉咙也切了
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

请便 想切就切吧
Go on, then. Cut his throat.

罗索 是你吧？
Lothar, is it?

詹姆爵士
Ser Jaime.

我们不知道你要来
We didn't know you were coming.

那是因为你没有做好封锁
'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.

八千个人未经任何阻挠就来到了你这
You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.

幸好我们是朋友 否则你们的屁眼现在已经被爆了
Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.

带艾德慕大人沐浴进餐
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

瓦德
Walder.

艾德慕是佛雷家的囚犯
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

只有傻瓜才拿自己做不到的事威胁别人
Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.

现在 我威胁要打你
Now let's say I threatened to hit you

除非你闭上嘴 但你还是说个不停
unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.

  你觉得我会怎么办？  我才不管你… 
What do you think I'd do? I don't give a rat's...

我依国王之命来此收回这座城堡
I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.

带他沐浴进餐
Have him bathed and fed.

除非你想取代他的位置
Unless you'd like to take his place.

我很抱歉 詹姆爵士
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

照他说的办
Do as he says.

现在由我指挥围攻
The siege is now under my command.

下一次黑鱼再从城墙往外看的时候
The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts,

他将看到的是兵临城下的军队 而不是你们这堆破玩意
he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.

让你的人开始挖外围的战壕
Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches.

每一百码设哨兵
Set pickets every hundred yards.

把这些攻城塔和投石机捣毁重做
And work doubletime on those siege towers and trebuchets.

这些是我们的攻城塔… 
Those are our siege towers...

我说了 现在听我指挥
As I said, the siege is under my command.

如果你不乐意 给我走人
If that's not to your liking, go home.

给黑鱼带个话
Get word to the Blackfish.

我要谈判
I want a parley.

是谈判还是单挑？
A parley or a fight?

他是个老头
He's an old man.

你只有一只手
You've got one hand.

我赌老家伙赢
My money's on the old boy.

莫尔蒙小姐
Lady Mormont.

欢迎来到熊岛
Welcome to Bear Island.

莱安娜・莫尔蒙
熊岛伯爵夫人

你出生的时候我还记得 小姐
I remember when you were born, my lady.

你以我的姑妈莱安娜的名字命名
You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

据说她是个大美人 想来你也会是
It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.

那不一定 我妈妈不是大美人
I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty

什么美人也不是
or any other kind of beauty.

但她是一位伟大的战士
She was a great warrior, though.

她为你哥哥罗柏战死
She died fighting for your brother Robb.

莱安娜小姐 我在黑城堡是你伯父的手下
I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

他也是一位伟大的战士 德高望重
He was also a great warrior and an honorable man.

我是他的事务官 事实上… 
I was his steward. In fact...

家长里短我们聊得够多了 说正事吧
I think we've had enough small talk. Why are you here?

史坦尼斯 ・ 拜拉席恩驻守黑城堡
Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black

他进军临冬城 然后被杀
before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.

他给我看过那封你回应他求援的信
He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.

  上面写道…   我记得上边写了什么
It said... I remember what it said.

熊岛不认国王
Bear Island knows no king

只认北境之王 名为史塔克
but the King in the North whose name is Stark.

罗柏死了
Robb is gone,

但史塔克家族没有
but House Stark is not.

它比任何时候都需要你们的支持
And it needs your support now more than ever.

我和我妹妹来此 希望得到莫尔蒙家族的效忠
I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.

据我所知 你是私生子
As far as I understand, you're a Snow

而珊莎夫人嫁到了波顿家
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

还是兰尼斯特家？
Or is she a Lannister?

消息太多 说什么的都有
I've heard conflicting reports.

小姐 我竭尽所能 只为生存
I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.

但我姓史塔克 永远都姓史塔克
But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.

随你 不过话说回来
If you say so. In any case,

你想要的不止我的忠诚 还有我的战士们
you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.

决不能让拉姆斯・波顿霸占临冬城 小姐
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady.

我们有责任阻止他
It is our duty to stop him.

此外 他还囚禁了我们的幼弟瑞肯・史塔克
Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

小姐 你必须明白… 
What you have to understand, my lady, is that...

我明白我的责任在于熊岛 在于岛上的每一个人
I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.

为什么我要为了一场别人的战争再去牺牲哪怕一个族人的性命呢？
So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?

小姐 请让我说两句
If it please, my lady,

我理解您的感受
I understand how you feel.

我不认识这位爵士 你是？
I don't know you, Ser...?

我是席渥斯家族的戴佛斯 小姐
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

您不必向学士询问我的家族
You needn't ask your maester about my house.

是一个新兴家族
It's rather new.

好吧 席渥斯家族的戴佛斯爵士
All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

你是如何理解我的感受的呢？
How is it you understand how I feel?

您从未想过有一天自己会身居如此高位
You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.

年纪轻轻 就要对这么多的人民负责
Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.

我也没想过会到达今天的位置
I never thought I'd be in my position.

我是一个捕蟹人的儿子 做过走私犯
I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.

在当今的战争年代 我的演说对象
And now I find myself addressing the lady

却是一个伟大家族的小姐
of a great house in time of war.

我在这里 是因为这不是别人的战争
But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.

这是我们的战争
It's our war.

继续说 戴佛斯爵士
Go on, Ser Davos.

您的伯父 莫尔蒙总司令
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

让这个人做了他的事务官
made that man his steward.

他选择琼恩做他的继任者 因为他深知
He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew

他有坚持正义的勇气
he had the courage to do what was right,

甚至不惜抛头颅洒热血
even if it meant giving his life.

因为杰奥・莫尔蒙和琼恩・雪诺都清楚
Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood

真正的战争不是几个家族间的吵吵闹闹
that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.

而是生者与亡者的对决
It's between the living and the dead.

不要铸成大错 小姐
And make no mistake, my lady,

亡者就要来了
the dead are coming.

真的吗？
Is this true?

你的伯父在先民拳峰与它们对战
Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.

我在艰难屯与它们交锋
I fought them at Hardhome.

两场皆败
We both lost.

波顿占据临冬城一日 北境就一日不得统一
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided.

四分五裂的北境在夜王面前没有半点胜算
And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.

你想要保护你的人民 小姐 我理解这一点
You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand.

但面对亡者大军他们无处可逃
But there's no hiding from this.

人类必须团结一心 共同抗敌
We have to fight and we need to do it together.

千年以来 莫尔蒙家族对史塔克忠心耿耿
House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years.

今日我们仍将坚守忠诚信念
We will not break faith today.

谢谢你 小姐
Thank you, my lady.

我们能获得多少人手？
How many fighting men can we expect?

六十二个
62.

六十二个？ 我们不是大家族
62? We are not a large house,

但我们是骄傲的家族
but we're a proud one.

每一个熊岛人
And every man from Bear Island

都能打十个内陆佬
fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

只要他们有小姐的一半勇猛
If they're half as ferocious as their lady,

波顿的末日就指日可待了
the Boltons are doomed.

弑君者
Kingslayer.

黑鱼
Blackfish.

我猜你此次前来
I assume you're here

是要履行对我侄女的诺言
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

可我没看到珊莎和艾莉亚
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

我没找到她们 真遗憾
I don't have them. Pity.

那你是回来继续做俘虏的喽？
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

那你为什么来？
Then why are you here?

你知道我为什么来
You know why I'm here.

这座城堡属于佛雷家族
This castle belongs to House Frey.

你这是侵略
You're trespassing.

以托曼国王之名 我命你即刻投降 否则… 
In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or...

否则你就杀了艾德慕？
Or you'll kill Edmure?

无论我怎么做 我侄子都难逃一死
My nephew's marked for death no matter what.

就请你快快吊死他吧
Hang him and be done with it.

不止艾德慕
It won't stop with Edmure.

你这是逼着我强攻城堡
You'll force me to storm the castle.

数百人会丧命
Hundreds will die.

我死几百人 你死几千人
Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.

前提还是你能突破城墙
If you can breach the walls.

我们定能攻破城墙 还将杀光城中老小
We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.

但只要你投降
But if you surrender,

我会饶了所有人的性命
I'll spare the lives of your men.

以我的荣誉发誓
On my honor.

你的荣誉？
Your honor?

与破誓者讨价还价就如同在流沙上面盖房子
Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.

战争已经结束了 爵士
The war is over, ser.

为什么还要为了已经失败的事业白白牺牲人命呢？
Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?

只要我还没倒下 战争就不算结束
As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.

这城堡是我的家
This is my home.

我出生在这里 也准备好了死在这里
I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.

你要么打过来
So you can either attack

要么试着把我们饿垮
or try to starve us out.

我们的给养能撑两年
We have enough provisions for two years.

你们撑得过两年吗 弑君者？
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

你显然无意拯救你的人民的生命
You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.

那你还来谈判作甚？
Why did you come treat with me?

围城枯燥得要命
Sieges are dull.

我是来见一见你本人 再好好掂量一下你
And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.

好吧 现在你见也见过了
Well, now you have.

是呀 我见过了
Aye, now I have.

我很失望
I'm disappointed.

答案是不
The answer is no.

葛洛佛伯爵 请你听我们说完 我听够了
Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. I've heard enough.

我们刚从铁民手里夺回这座城堡
We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.

波顿帮了我们一把
The Boltons helped us do it.

现在你想让我反水去打他们？
Now you want me to fight against them?

罗贝特・葛洛佛
盖伯特伯爵的弟弟

光是和你们谈话我就有可能被剥皮
I could be skinned for even talking to you.

波顿是叛徒 卢斯・波顿… 
The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton...

有其他北境家族愿意为你们而战吗？
Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?

莫尔蒙家族
House Mormont.

还有呢？
And?

我们向曼德勒家族放出了渡鸦… 
We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...

我不关心什么渡鸦
I don't care about ravens.

你要我加入你的军队
You're asking me to join your army.

这支军队里都有谁？
Who is fighting in this army?

主要是野人
The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.

那么流言是真的了
Then the rumors are true.

我之前都不敢相信
I didn't dare believe them.

出于对你们父亲的敬意 我接见了你们
I received you out of respect for your father.

现在我要求你们离开
Now I would like you to leave.

葛洛佛家族不会辱没先祖
House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home

去和野人并肩而战
to fight alongside wildlings.

葛洛佛伯爵 没什么好说的了
Lord Glover. There's nothing else to say.

我要提醒你
I would remind you that House Glover

葛洛佛家族向史塔克家族效忠
is pledged to House Stark.

宣誓响应史塔克家族的号召
Sworn to answer when called upon.

是的 几百年以来我的家族一直侍奉史塔克家族
Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries.

收到令尊死讯的时候我们纷纷流下眼泪
We wept when we heard of your father's death.

我的兄长做这座城堡的领主时 响应了罗柏的号召
When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call

推举他为北境之王
and hailed him King in the North.

但是当铁民攻入这座城堡
And where was King Robb

把我的妻儿投入狱中
when the ironborn attacked this castle?

残杀我们的家臣的时候
When they threw my wife and children in prison

罗柏国王又在哪里呢？
and brutalized and killed our subjects?

和一个外国婊子鬼混
Taking up with a foreign whore.

害得自己和追随者们中计身死
Getting himself and those who followed him killed.

我曾经侍奉过史塔克家族
I served House Stark once,

但史塔克家族已经灭亡了
but House Stark is dead.

席恩・葛雷乔伊 
“臭佬”

我们为什么要来这里？
Why did we have to come here?

亚拉・葛雷乔伊
海怪之女

我们中还是有人喜欢这里的
Some of us still like it.

多少喝一杯吧
Have a drink at least.

我不想喝
I don't want one.

不要走远 甜心
Don't go far, love.

我很快就去找你
I'll find you in a bit.

在铁群岛上可没有这等翘臀
Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.

你当真一点性趣也没有了吗？
Doesn't interest you anymore?

抱歉 我不开那方面的玩笑了
I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.

我永远不会伤害你的 小弟弟
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

你知道吧？
Don't you know that?

你觉得攸伦叔叔正在搜捕我们？
You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

那是当然 只要我们活着 对他就是个威胁
Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.

他会找到我们的
He'll find us.

世界很大 我们有快船
It's a great big world and we have fast ships.

喝了它
Drink.

我不想喝
I don't want any.

我不管你想不想 喝
I don't care what you want. Drink.

都喝了
Drink it all.

你是个铁种 席恩 我知道你这几年很难熬
You're ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.

这几年很难熬？
Some bad years?

但我已经受够了看着你像条落水狗一样畏畏缩缩
But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.

把他妈的麦酒喝了
Drink the goddamn ale.

现在听我说
Now listen to me.

我需要你
I need you.

我需要真正的席恩・葛雷乔伊 不是这个老鼠屎一样的冒牌货
The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender.

你能帮我找到他吗？
Can you find him for me?

喝
Drink.

你逃出来了 听到了吗？
You escaped. You hear me?

你逃出来了 永远不会再回去了
You got away and you're never going back.

我们会为你讨回公道
We'll get justice for you.

按照公道 我应该被烧死然后吊在临冬城门前
If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.

那就去他妈的公道 我们要复仇 喝
Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.

听我说
Listen to me.

如果你这样萎靡 那就再也没有机会了
If you're so broken that there's no coming back,

你还不如拿把刀割了手腕
take a knife and cut your wrists.

了结这一切
End it.

但如果你留下 席恩 我需要你
But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.

我们要驶去弥林
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

我们要去和那个龙女王达成协议
We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.

我们要把铁群岛给夺回来
And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.

你站在我这边吗？
Are you with me?

你真的站在我这边吗？
Are you really with me?

那么 既然过了今晚咱们就一时半会上不了岸
Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,

我要好好跟她来上一发
I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.

史坦尼斯在去临冬城的路上在这里扎过营
Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.

好事？
And that's a good thing?

他曾是维斯特洛最有经验的指挥官
He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.

他选择这里一定是有原因的
He chose this place for a reason.

有山作天然屏障
Those mountains are a natural fortification.

有河可以饮马
There's a stream down there for the horses.

我们不会在这儿呆太久
We're not staying here long.

随时可能有另一场风暴袭来
Another storm could hit any day.

是啊 暴风雪击败了史坦尼斯
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis

战功跟波顿家族相当
as much as the Boltons did.

我们必须趁现在向临冬城进军
We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.

我们有两千野人
2,000 wildlings,

霍伍德家的两百人 梅辛家的一百四十三人… 
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

莫尔蒙家的六十二人
62 Mormonts.

比我们预计的要少得多
It's not what we'd hoped for.

但是如果我们足够谨慎和精明的话 还是有机会的
But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.

操他妈的
For fuck's sake.

他现在成了你最信任的顾问了？
So he's your most trusted advisor now?

就因为他从一个十岁小孩那里弄来了六十二个人？
Because he secured 62 men from a 10yearold?

多亏了戴佛斯爵士 我现在才能站在这儿和你说话
Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you

而且他效忠史坦尼斯已经很多年了
and he served Stannis for years.

输掉了黑水河之战的史坦尼斯
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

杀了自己弟弟的史坦尼斯 断头的史坦尼斯？
who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?

这还远远不够 我们需要更多的人手
It's not enough. We need more men.

可我们没有时间了
There's no time.

如果我们去赛文城的话 我认识那里的领主… 
If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord...

我们只能靠现有的军队去战斗
We fight with the army we have.

朋友们 不值得为这点事打起来
Friends, this is not worth fighting over!

别打了 到此为止
This'll be it, now.

好吧 这事儿没必要打架… 
Right, now we don't need to be fighting...

你他妈的是谁？ 等等
Who the fuck are you? Hold on.

对啊 你他妈的是谁啊？
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

我曾经是个士兵
I was a soldier once.

我的上级全都以为我非常勇敢
All my superiors thought I was brave.

实际上我并不勇敢 没错 我从来没临阵脱逃过
I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight.

那只是因为我害怕战友们会看出来我在害怕
Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.

我只不过是个懦夫
That's all I was, a coward.

我们服从命令 无论那命令是什么
We followed orders no matter the orders.

烧了那个村子
Burn that village.

好吧 我就来当这个纵火犯
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

去偷那个农民的庄稼 行 我现在成了个贼
Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief.

杀了那些小伙子 这样他们就不会反抗我们
Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.

我就又成了杀人凶手
I'm your murderer.

我记得有一次 一个女人向我们尖叫
I remember once a woman screaming at us,

我们把她儿子从小屋里拖出来的时候 她叫我们禽兽
calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.

但我们不是禽兽
But we weren't animals.

禽兽从来都是顺应自己的天性
Animals are true to their nature

而我们却违反了天性
and we had betrayed ours.

我亲自割了那个男孩的喉咙
I cut that young boy's throat myself

他的母亲一直在尖叫
as his mother screamed

我的战友们拉着她
and my friends held her back.

那天晚上… 
That night...

我感到万分羞愧
I felt such shame.

这种羞耻感是如此的沉重
Shame was so heavy on me,

我甚至吃不下饭 睡不着觉
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

我能做的就只有盯着那片昏暗的天空
All I could do was stare into that dark sky

脑海中回响着那位母亲喊她儿子的声音
and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.

我这辈子都没法忘记那声音
I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.

现在 我明白我永远不能让那个孩子死而复生
Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.

在我的余生里我能做到的
All I can do with time I've got left

就只有给这个世界带来一点善意了
is bring a little goodness into the world.

我们每个人都能做到这点 不是吗？
That's all any of us can do, isn't it?

不再打劫
Never too late to stop robbing people,

不再杀人 这永远都不会太迟
to stop killing people.

开始帮助别人
Start helping people.

转恶向善永远都不会太迟
It's never too late to come back.

我们并不期望着诸神回应我们的祈祷
And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.

这甚至和诸神无关 只和我们自己有关
It's not even about the gods. It's about you.

得明白 我们的祈祷要靠自己去回应
Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.

七神祝福你们 朋友们
Seven save you, friends.

有什么可以效劳的？
How can we help you?

你们在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

嗯 我们在谈论人生
Well, we're talking about life.

你们呢？
You?

我们在保护人民
Protecting the people.

好吧 我们感谢你们的保护
Well, we thank you for your protection.

可你们是在保护我们免受什么人的伤害呢？
Who are you protecting us from?

柠檬
无旗兄弟会成员

你们有马么？
Do you have any horses?

我们没有马
No horses.

没有金子 也没有兵器
No gold. No steel.

吃的总该有吧 保护人民可是很容易饿的
Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.

我想也是
I'm sure it is.

欢迎留下来一起吃晚餐
You're welcome to stay for supper,

但是我们也有很多吃不饱的人
but we have hungry mouths here.

照顾好自己
Stay safe.

长夜漫漫 处处险恶
The night is dark and full of terrors.

“七神祝福你们 朋友们”
"Seven save you, friends."

我他妈的是个修士 我还能说什么？
I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?

他们不信你的七神
They don't believe in your Seven.

他们是兄弟会的人 信的是红神
They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.

哎呀 好吧 这里欢迎所有人
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

无论如何 我们没什么可给他们的
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

你当然有 你有吃的
Sure, you do. You've got food,

你还有武器 就算你告诉他们没有
you've got steel even if you say you don't.

你这里还有女人
And you've got women.

你打算怎么办？跟他们打？
What do you want to do? Fight them?

杀了他们？
Kill them?

只能靠你一个对付他们所有人
It'd be you against all of them.

我是说 其他人可不会战斗
I mean, these people don't know how to fight.

你会
You do.

我再也不打仗了
I'm done with fighting.

自卫呢？
Even if it's to protect yourself?

暴力是一种疾病
Violence is a disease.

你不可能通过传染更多的人来治愈疾病
You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.

你死了的话也没法治病了
You don't cure it by dying, either.

你今天干的活够多了
You've done enough work for one day.

来吃点晚饭吧
Come on up for some supper.

今天晚上会很冷
It's gonna be a cold night.

我们需要柴火
We'll need firewood.

我会给你留一碗炖肉的
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

没准还能藏一点麦酒带给你
Might even have some ale hidden away.

他是个实在人
He's not a lying man.

他说铁舰队已经到了奴隶湾
He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.

艾莉亚・史塔克
“无名之辈”

我信了他
I'm inclined to believe him.

我可要离那些疯子远点
I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.

你是维斯特洛人
You're Westerosi.

关你什么事？
What do you care?

我想要坐船回家
I want to book passage home.

就你？你付不起路费的
You? Can't afford it.

你从哪儿偷来的这些？
Where'd you steal this from?

关你什么事？
Why do you care?

我们两天后离开
We leave in two days.

你可以住在三等舱的吊床上
You can have a hammock in steerage.

我想要一件单独的舱房
I want a cabin.

而且我们一早就走
And we'll leave at dawn.

日出的时候见
See you at sunrise.

小甜妞
Sweet girl.

流浪儿
无面者
