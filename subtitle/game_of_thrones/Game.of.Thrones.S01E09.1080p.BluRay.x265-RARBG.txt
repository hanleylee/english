第一季第九集  Baelor
贝勒圣堂

您受苦了 大人
You've seen better days, My Lord.

你又来了？
Another visit?

艾德・史塔克
临冬城公爵 昵称“奈德”

看来你倒成了我仅剩的朋友
It seems you're my last friend.

哪里 很多人爱戴着您啊
No no, many still love you.

珊莎今天早上刚上朝
Sansa came to court this morning

为您求情
to plead for your life.

为我下跪求饶是不是？
On her knees, begging for me, hmmm.

你是不是跟别人一起看她的笑话？
Did you laugh with the others?

您错怪我了 大人
You do me wrong, My Lord.

我对您的血一点兴趣都没有
Your blood is the last thing I want.

我不知道你感兴趣的是什么
I don't know what you want.

也不想再猜了
I've given up trying to guess.

瓦里斯
太监 情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

我小时候
When I was still a boy

在他们用红热的匕首割我之前
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife

曾跟戏班子在自由贸易城邦巡回演出
I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities.

他们教会我每个人都有自己该扮演的角色
They taught me that each man has a role to play.

朝廷里也是如此
The same is true at court.

我是情报总管
I am the master of whisperers.

当然应该诡计多端 擅长逢迎拍捧 行事无孔不入
My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples.

我演得不错吧 大人
I'm a good actor, My Lord.

你能把我从这地穴救出去吗？
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

我能
I could.

但我要不要做呢？
But will I?

当然不
No.

我说过 我不是英雄
As I said, I'm no hero.

告诉我 你究竟想要什么？
What do you want? Tell me.

别再打哑谜 兜圈子了 你给我说清楚
No riddles, no storiestell me, what do you want?

和平
Peace.

您知不知道令公子带着北方大军南下了
Did you know that your son is marching south

这孩子一片孝心
with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad

为救父亲不顾一切
fighting for his father's freedom.

罗柏？
Robb?

他只是个孩子
He's just a boy.

自古英雄出少年哪
Boys have been conquerors before.

不过真正令瑟曦寝食难安的是国王...
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights

已故国王的弟弟史坦尼斯大人
is the King'sthe late King's brother.

他的继承权名正言顺
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne,

本人又能征善战 而且绝不心软
he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩是劳勃真正的继承人
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.

王位理应归他所有
The Throne is his by rights.

啧啧 珊莎那么努力地为您求情
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life,

若是不把握机会 实在太可惜了
it would be a shame to throw it away.

瑟曦不笨
Cersei is no fool.

她知道驯服的狼比死狼有用得多
She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.

你竟然要我为谋害我的国王 屠杀我的部下
You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King,

还把我儿子摔成残废的女人效力？
who butchered my men, who crippled my son?

我要您为国家效力！
I want you to serve the realm!

对太后承诺您愿意坦白邪恶的叛国罪行
Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason,

并命令您儿子放下武器
tell your son to lay down his sword

尊乔佛里为真正的国王
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

瑟曦知道您是个言行一致的人
Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

只要您成全她
If you give her the peace she needs

并保证死也不说出她的秘密
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

我相信她会同意您穿上黑衣
I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days

在长城和您弟弟 还有您那私生子一起渡过余生
on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.

你以为我的命珍贵到那种地步
You think my life is some precious thing to me?

值得让我用荣誉去换那区区几年...
That I would trade my honor for a few more years of...

那算什么？
Of what?

你跟着戏班子长大
You grew up with actors.

你学会了演戏 而且演得很好
You learned their craft and you learned it well.

但我从小跟战士们为伍
But I grew up with soldiers.

早就知道如何面对死亡
I learned how to die a long time ago.

可惜
Pity.

真可惜
Such a pity.

大人 您女儿的性命呢？
What of your daughter's life, My Lord?

那对您又有多珍贵？
Is that a precious thing to you?

这是他给曾侄孙女瓦妲的生日贺信
It's a birthday message to his grandniece Walda.

席恩・葛雷乔伊
临冬城公爵养子

这是瓦德・佛雷的障眼法
Or so Walder Frey would have you think.

继续射杀出城的乌鸦
Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder

罗德利克・凯索
临冬城教头

绝不能让瓦德大人把你的动向报告给兰尼斯特
sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.

他好歹是外公的封臣 为什么不肯支持我们？
He's grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?

罗柏・史塔克
临冬城公爵长子

别对瓦德・佛雷抱任何期望 没有他干不出的事
Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised.

看
Look.

父亲正在地牢里受苦
Father rots in a dungeon.

随时可能掉脑袋
How long before they take his head?

我们得赶紧渡过三叉戟河 否则就来不及了
We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.

咱们干脆把大军开到城门口 叫他开门得了
Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing.

我们的兵力足足是他五倍 如果必要 你可以拿下孪河城
We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.

恐怕短时间内不行 而泰温・兰尼斯特正兼程北上
Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

佛雷家族把守渡口已经六百年
The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years,

六百年来 他们从不忘收取过桥费
and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.

凯特琳・徒利
临冬城公爵夫人

备马 我去谈判
Have my horse saddled and ready.

琼恩・安柏
史塔克家族的封臣 "大琼恩"

只身前往孪河城 他会把您卖给兰尼斯特
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

他会把你丢进地牢 甚或割了你喉咙
Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.

换成我父亲在这里 为了让部下渡河
My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing.

他会不惜做出一切牺牲
Whatever it took.

如今我是大军统帅
If I'm going to lead this army,

同样不能躲起来逃避责任
I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.

同意
I agree.

让我去 您不能去！
I'll go. You can't!

我从小就认识瓦德大人
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.

他不会对我怎样的
He would never harm me.

除非有利可图
Unless there was a profit in it.

你来干什么？
What do you want?

大人 多年不见 今日重逢真是倍感喜悦
It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord.

哦 省省罢
Oh spare me.

你家儿子太尊贵 不愿亲自来见我
Your boy's too proud to come before me himself.

瓦德・佛雷
徒利家族的封臣 孪河城城主

我又该拿你怎么办呢？
What am I supposed to do with you?

父亲 您忘了吗？史塔克夫人正是受您...
Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here

谁问你了？我没死 你就不是佛雷侯爵
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,

我看起来像死人吗？
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

史提夫伦・佛雷
瓦德・佛雷的长子和继承人

父亲 请您...
Father, please

连我的私生子都教训起我待客之道啦？
I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

要不是我把你小子播到你妈肚子里
Your mother would still be a milkmaid

她还在牧羊咧
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

第八任佛雷夫人

好吧 你过来
All right, you come forward.

喏 我已经行过礼了
There. Now that I've observed the courtesies,

或许我的儿子们可以赏个脸 给我闭上嘴巴
perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.

我们可否好好谈谈？
Is there somewhere we can talk?

我们现在不就在谈？
We're talking right now.

好吧
Fine.

滚！还不快滚！
Out! All of you!

你也一样
You too.

看见没有？
You see that?

她才十五岁
15 she is.

像朵小花
A little flower.

她的花蜜可是只给我一个人喝哟
And her honey's all mine.

我相信她会给您添许多儿子的
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

嘿 你老爸没来参加我的婚礼
Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.

他身体欠安 大人
He is quite ill, My Lord.

我上次结婚他也没来
Didn't come to the last one either.

还有上上次
Or the one before that.

你们家的人老是看我不顺眼
Your family has always pissed on me.

大人 我... 别否认 你很清楚我说的是实话
My Lord, IDon't deny it. You know it's true.

高高在上的徒利大人
The fine Lord Tully

死也不肯跟我联姻
would never marry any of his children to mine.

恐怕当年事出有因...
I'm sure there were reasons why

我不想听原因 只想赶紧嫁掉儿女们
I didn't need reasons. I needed to get rid

这帮兔崽子家里都快堆不下了
of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up?

你到底来干什么？
Why are you here?

我来请求您
To ask you

打开城门 大人
to open your gates, My Lord,

让我儿子和他的军队渡过三叉戟河 赶赴前线
so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.

我为何要放他过去？
Why should I let him?

你要是还能爬上自己的城墙
If you could climb your own battlements,

你会看到城外有他的两万精兵
you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.

等泰温・兰尼斯特赶到 他们就会变成两万具尸体
They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here.

史塔克夫人 你少吓唬我
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

你丈夫被关在红堡底下的牢房
Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep

你儿子连自个儿的卵蛋都偎不暖
and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.

你可是宣誓效忠于我父亲
You swore an oath to my father.

呵 可不是吗 我发过誓...
Oh yes, I said some words...

但没记错的话 我也宣誓效忠王室啊
And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right.

依我看 这会儿既然乔佛里是国王
Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy

你家小鬼以及外面那群活尸不就是叛徒嘛？
and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

这事连鱼都知道
If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish,

按理说 我该把你们娘俩献给兰尼斯特
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

那你为什么不动手？ 史塔克 徒利
Why don't you? Stark, Tully,

兰尼斯特 拜拉席恩
Lannister, Baratheon,

给我个好理由
give me one good reason

我凭什么要管你们的闲事？
why I should waste a single thought on any of you?

攻击
And... engage.

伊蒙估计你的手多久可以复原？
When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?

他说快了 那敢情好
Soon, he says. Good.

到时候你就用这个
You'll be ready for this then.

我想狼比熊更适合你
I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令的事务官

所以把圆头重新打过了
than a bear...

它名叫‘长爪’
So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw.

杰奥・莫尔蒙
守夜人总司令

瞧 狼和熊都有爪子
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

这是瓦雷利亚钢剑
This is Valyrian steel.

这是我父亲的剑
It was my father's sword,

我祖父传给他的
his father before him.

这把剑在莫尔蒙家族传承了五百年
The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.

它本来属于我儿子乔拉
It was meant for my son Jorah.

但他让我们家族蒙羞
He brought dishonor to our House,

好歹他逃离维斯特洛之前
but he had the grace to leave the sword

懂得留下这把剑
before he fled from Westeros.

大人 您让我受宠若惊 可我不能...
My Lord, you honor me, but I can't

噢 你受之无愧
Oh, you can and you will.

若不是你和你那头狼 我就不会站在这里了
I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast.

差点被个见鬼的死人干掉...
A bloody dead man tried to kill me...

所以快拿去 别再跟我罗嗦
So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it.

听懂了没？ 是 大人
Is that understood? Yes, My Lord.

很好 但别以为
Right. Now don't think this means

这代表我赞同你
I approve of this nonsense

顶撞艾里沙・索恩
with you and Alliser Thorne.

这是把成年人的剑
That's a man's sword,

也只有成年人才配用它
it'll take a man to wield it.

我今晚就去跟艾里沙爵士道歉
I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

不必了
No you won't!

我昨天就派他去了君临
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

带着那只被你的狼
The hand that your wolf

从那东西身上咬断的手
tore off that thing's wrist

我命令索恩呈给
I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this...

小鬼国王看看
Boy King.

这总该吸引小鬼头乔佛里的注意罢
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

而且如此一来
And it puts a thousand leagues

你和索恩就隔开了几千里
between you and Thorne.

你去罢 把剑收好
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe

把我的晚餐端来
and bring me my supper.

是 大人
Yes, My Lord.

干得漂亮 干得漂亮
Well done. Well done.

这是你应得的 雪诺
You earned that, Snow.

干得漂亮
Well done.

快过来让咱们瞧瞧罢
Go on, let's have a look.

瞧什么？ 那把剑！我们想瞧瞧那把剑
At what? The sword! Show us the sword.

拿剑来！拿剑来！拿剑来！拿剑来！
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

让我仔细瞧瞧
Let's have a look.

放手 一边去
Piss off.Get off of it. Piss off.

快拿来 我要就着光亮好好欣赏
Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.

递过来！
Give it here!

怎么了？
What is it?

我...
I

拿给我 我不该...
Give it. I can't.

你不该什么？
You can't what?

我...我不该说这个
II'm really not supposed to say.

但你想说出来
And yet you really want to say.

你想说什么？
You want to say that...?

有只乌鸦送信来
There was a raven.

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人事务官

是我读给伊蒙师傅听的
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

是你哥哥罗柏的事
It's your brother Robb.

什么？
What?

他怎么了？
What about him?

他率军南下
He's heading south.

去打仗
To war.

不过不用担心 他召集了所有封臣 一定能平安归来
All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.

我应该在他身边
I should be there.

应该跟他并肩作战
I should be with him.

...这意味着他们被送上了绝路
...If we do that, they'll never get back across.

怎么？
Well?

他怎么说？
What did he say?

瓦德大人会让你过河
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

他的军队也是你的
His men are yours as well

他还会亲率四百人防守河渡口
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing

为你阻挡追兵
against any who would pursue you.

他要我们怎样回报？
And what does he want in return?

他的儿子奥利法将担任你的私人侍从
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.

过段时间以后 你要策封其为骑士 没问题
He expects a knighthood in good time. Fine fine.

还有呢？
And?

还有艾莉亚
And Arya

要嫁给瓦德大人的儿子瓦多...
will marry his son Waldron

...等两人成年以后 她不会喜欢的
when they both come of age. She won't be happy about that.

还有吗？
And?

还有
And

等战事结束...
when the fighting is done...

你也将迎娶他一个女儿
You will marry one of his daughters.

你可以自己挑
Whichever you prefer.

他有好些个适合的...人选
He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.

原来如此
I see.

你有没看看她们长什么样？
Did you get a look at his daughters?

看了
I did.

怎么样？
And?

有一个倒还...
One was...

你同意吗？
Do you consent?

我可以拒绝吗？
Can I refuse?

那你就不能渡河
Not if you want to cross.

那么我同意
Then I consent.

山姆说您有事找我？
Sam said you wanted to see me?

是我的意思
I did indeed.

或许你愿意好心地帮我个忙
Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.

告诉我 你可曾想过
Tell me, did you ever wonder

为何守夜人
why the men of The Night's Watch

不娶妻也不生子？
take no wives and father no children?

我没想过
No.

如此一来 他们才不会为情爱所困
So they will not love.

情爱是责任的大忌
Love is the death of duty.

假如有这么一天 你的父亲大人
If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose

伊蒙・坦格利安
守夜人的学士

必须在荣誉
between honor on the one hand

和他所爱之人间做出抉择
and those he loves on the other,

他会怎么做？
what would he do?

他会做他应该做的事 不管那是什么
He would do whatever was right. No matter what.

那么艾德大人是万里挑一的君子
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

多数人不如他这么坚强
Most of us are not so strong.

跟女人的情爱相比
What is honor

荣誉算得了什么？
compared to a woman's love?

跟怀抱中的初生幼儿
And what is duty

或是兄弟的笑容相比
against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?

责任又算得了什么？
Or a brother's smile?

山姆告诉您了
Sam told you.

我们身为凡人
We're all human.

噢 当毋需付出代价时 自然都能尽忠职守
Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it.

坚守荣誉似乎是那么简单
Honor comes easy then.

然而
Yet sooner or later

每个人生命中
in every man's life

迟早会遇到考验
there comes a day when it is not easy,

那便是他必须抉择的时刻
a day when he must choose.

如今就是我要抉择的时刻
And this is my day?

您的意思是这样吗？
Is that what you're saying?

孩子 这很痛苦
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh yes.

噢 可不是嘛 我知道 你不知道！
I know. You do not know!

没人知道！
No one knows.

就算我是私生子
I may be a bastard,

但他依旧是我父亲 罗柏依旧是我哥哥
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

天上诸神为我的誓言设下了残酷的考验
The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows.

他们直等到我步入老年之后
They waited till I was old.

乌鸦从南方带来我家族灭亡的消息
What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South

带来我亲人惨死的消息 我能做什么呢？
the ruin of my House, the death of my family?

我这个身体虚弱的瞎眼老人
I was helpless,

是如此无助
blind, frail.

可一旦想到
But when I heard

他们杀害了我弟弟的儿子
they had killed my brother's son,

和他可怜的孙子
and his poor son...

还有那些孩儿！
And the children!

那些无辜的孩儿
Even the little children.

您究竟是谁？
Who are you?

我父亲
My father was Maekar,

是梅卡一世
the first of his name.

在他之后 我拒绝了王位
My brother Aegon reigned after him

于是由我弟弟伊耿继承
when I had refused the Throne.

伊耿又将王位传给了他儿子伊里斯
And he was followed by his son Aerys,

也就是人们口中的“疯王”
whom they called the Mad King.

您是伊蒙・坦格利安
You're Aemon Targaryen.

我是自学城毕业
I'm a Maester of the Citadel,

立誓为黑城堡与守夜人奉献心力的学士
bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch.

我不会要求你留下或是离开
I will not tell you to stay or go.

你必须自己做出抉择
You must make that choice yourself,

然后一辈子与之相伴
and live with it for the rest of your days.

就像我一样
As I have.

夫君
My lord...

我的日和星
My sun and stars...

卓戈
Drogo

我的马...我的马...
My steed...My...steed.

吾血之血
Blood of my blood.

不 我必须骑马
No,I must ride.

他从自己的马上摔下来
He fell from his horse.

无法骑马的卡奥便不再是卡奥
A Khal who cannor ride is no khal.

他累了 就是这样 他需要休息
He's tired,that's all.He needs to rest.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
卡丽熙

今天我们骑得也够远了 就在这里扎营
We have ridden far enough. We will camp here.

这里不能扎营
This is no place to camp.

女人无权命令我们停下 即便卡丽熙也不例外
A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

卓戈 卡奥 
多斯拉克部族首领

我们就在这里扎营 就说这是卓戈卡奥的命令
We will camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. Qotho...

你无权命令我 卡丽熙
You do not command me, Khallesi.

去把弥丽・马兹・笃尔找到 带她来见我
Find Mirri Maaz Duur. Bring her to me.

巫魔女？我会把她的脑袋带来 卡丽熙
The witch? I will bring you her head khaleesi.

把她毫发无损的带来
Bring her to me unharmed

否则等卓戈醒来 他会知道你如何忤逆我
or Khal Drogo will hear you defied me.

哈戈
血盟卫

斥候回报
Our scouts tell us

史塔克军已从孪河城南下
the Stark host has moved south from the Twins

佛雷大人的部队加入了他们
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

此刻敌军就在北边 距离我们一日行程
They're a day's march north.

小鬼不自量力 又没经验
The boy may lack experience and sense,

不过倒确有点乡巴佬
but he does have a certain mindless

初生牛犊不怕虎的劲头
provincial courage.

继续说啊 别让我坏了你们的兴致
Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.

希望你那群野蛮人不要一无是处
I do hope your savages are going to be of some use,

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 西境守护 国王外祖父

否则我们精良的装备就白白浪费了
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

那浑身是毛的高个子坚持要拿两把战斧...
The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes

里奥・莱佛德
兰尼斯特家族封臣 金牙城领主

还是黑色重钢 两面开刃的上等货
heavy black steel, doublesided.

夏嘎喜欢斧头
Shagga likes axes.

开战的时候
When the battle commences, you and your wildlings

你和你那群野人将被放在前锋
will be in the vanguard.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
国王舅舅 "小恶魔"

前锋？
The vanguard?

让我和原住民一起冲锋陷阵？
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

他们看起来很威猛
They do seem rather ferocious.

威猛？昨晚
Ferocious? Last night

有个月人部的为一根香肠 捅死了石鸦部的人
a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

三个石鸦部的人抓住凶手 割了喉咙
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat.

波隆好不容易才阻止夏嘎剁掉死人的老二
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock,

不幸中的大幸 即便如此
which was fortunate, but even still

乌尔夫还坚决要求他们付赔偿金
Ulf is demanding blood money,

而冈梭尔和夏嘎不肯
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

士兵缺乏纪律 说明指挥官领导无方
When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.

再怎么想我死
Surely there are ways to have me killed

也不能拿战争当儿戏吧
that would be less detrimental to the war effort.

这事已经定了
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

我发现自己一点也不饿
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

诸位大人 告退
Excuse me, My Lords.

兵荒马乱的 你打哪儿找来这么个漂亮妞？
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?

抢的 抢的？
I took her. Took her?

波隆
佣兵

从谁手里？ 从 呃...
From whom? From, uh...

想想...叫啥爵士来着？
Serwhat's his name?

忘了 三个帐篷外的棕发佬
I don't know. Ginger cunt three tents down.

他屁都没放一个？
And he didn't have anything to say about it?

话倒是说了两句
He said something.

算了 我能不能活到
Well, the odds of me living long enough

他来寻仇那天还难说咧
for him to retaliate just dropped drastically.

我们明天打前锋
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

噢 既然如此
Oh well.

我还是给自己再找个妞吧
I... think I'll go and find myself one.

你是谁呢？
Who are you?

您希望我是谁？
Who would you like me to be?

你母亲怎么称呼你？
What did your mother call you?

雪伊
Shae.

您母亲又如何称呼您呢？
What did your mother call you?

我母亲生我时难产而死
My mother died giving birth to me.

您叫我来就为这个？谈论我们的母亲？
Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?

你那是什么口音？ 外国口音
What sort of accent is that? Foreign.

外...
For

雪伊
妓女

您想要我做什么？
What do you want from me?

我想要你做什么？
What do I want from you?

我要你和我一起住
I want you to share my tent.

为我倒酒 陪我说笑
I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes,

每天在我奔波之后替我按摩双脚
rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride.

而且只要我们在一起
I want you to take no other man to bed

你就不许跟其他男人上床
for as long as we're together.

最重要的是 我要你拿出世界末日的劲头跟我风流快活
And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world

说不定明天真是世界末日
which it may well be.

那我能获得什么回报？
And what do I get?

首先是安全
One: Safety.

没人敢动我的妞
No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine.

其次 我的陪伴
Two: The pleasure of my company,

我某些方面的口碑可是一等一的
which I have heard is spectacular.

口碑？您拿钱包上的婊子说的？
Who told you this? Women you paid?

第三
And three: More gold

你活上一千年也花不完的金子
than you can spend if you lived a thousand years.

你接受我的条件吗？
Do you accept my proposal?

就让我们从世界末日那部分开始吧
Let's start with your last night in this world.

多斯...多斯拉...
Doth...Dothrae...

克...牦牛...
ki...yak...

踩着...
might trample...

黑色的鹳鸟...
a black stork...

卡丽熙
Khaleesi.

进来
Come.

他非常强壮
He's very strong.

没人能比他强壮
No one understands how strong he is.

乔拉・莫尔蒙
杰奥・莫尔蒙之子

他熬不过今晚 卡丽熙 他不能死
He will die tonight, Khaleesi. He can't.

他不可以死 我不会让他死...
He can't. I won't let him.

这个命令超出了公主您的能力所及
Even a Queen doesn't have that power.

我们得赶紧走 听说亚夏有个繁盛的大港...
We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai

我不要离开他 您丈夫救不活了 卡丽熙
I won't leave him. He's already gone, Khaleesi.

即便...
Even if

即便他死了
Even if he dies,

我为什么要逃走？
why would I run?

我是卡丽熙
I am Khaleesi

我的...我的儿子将会继任卡奥
and mymy son will be Khal after Drogo.

这不是崇尚血统的维斯特洛
This isn't Westeros where men honor blood.

在这里力量决定一切
Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting

卓戈死后 他们会自相残杀
after Drogo dies.

胜者即为新的卡奥
Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal.

而他一定不会养虎为患
He won't want any rivals.

您的孩子刚出生就会被夺走
Your boy will be plucked from your breast

拿去喂狗
and given to the dogs.

我不要离开他
I won't leave him.

伤口化脓了
The wound has festered.

巫魔女 都是你干的好事
You did this,witch.

住手！
Stop it.

我不许你伤害她
I don't want her hurt.

住手？住手？你不许我伤害她？
No? No? You don't want her hurt?

最好祈祷我们不要伤害你吧
Pray we don't hurt you too.

是你让巫魔女害了我们的卡奥
You let this witch put her hands on out Khal.

讲话小心一点 她仍然是你的卡丽熙
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

除非吾血之血还能活下去
Only while blood of my blood lives.

在他死后 她就什么也不是了
When he dies, she is nothing.

我从来不是无名之辈 我是真龙传人
I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon.

龙早就死绝了 卡丽熙
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

我想今晚你得穿上盔甲了 爵士
I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser.

您说得没错
I think you're right.

您又救了我一命
You've saved me once more.

换你救他一命了
And now you must save him.

已经没有任何医者可以救他
He's beyond the healer's skills.

我能做的 只是让他毫无痛苦的上路
All I can do is ease his path.

只要你救他 我就放你自由 我对天发誓
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

弥丽・马兹・笃尔
神庙女祭司

你一定还知道其他的办法...
You must know a way...

某种...
Some...

某种魔法
Some magic.

的确有一种魔法
There is a spell.

但对某些人而言 死亡反而比较干脆
Some would say death is cleaner.

动手吧
Do it.

快救救他
Save him.

您必须付出代价
There is a price.

你要黄金？多少都可以
You'll have goldwhatever you want.

这不是黄金的问题 这是血魔法
It's not a matter of gold. This is Bloodmagic.

惟有死亡方能换取生命
Only death pays for life.

我的死？
My death?

不 不是您的死 卡丽熙
No. Not your death, Khaleesi.

把他的马带进来
Bring me his horse.

卡丽熙 这事做不得
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

请让我杀了这女巫吧 杀了她 你就是杀了你的卡奥
Let me kill this witch. Kill her and you kill your Khal.

伊丽
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

可这是血魔法啊 这是禁忌
This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.

我是卡丽熙 我说不是就不是
I am your Khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.

出去！
Go now!

带她出去
Take her and leave.

拉卡洛
血盟卫

带她出去！
Take her!

伊丽？
Irriya?

夫人 您也得出去
You must go also, lady.

一旦我开始吟唱 任何人都不能进入这座帐篷
Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent.

今晚亡灵将在此舞蹈
The dead will dance here tonight.

任何人都不会进入
No one will enter.

请为我把他带回来
Bring him back to me.

您到底做了些什么？
What have you done?

我非救他不可
I have to save him.

我们本来可以去亚夏 这会儿够跑出去十里了
We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai.

您本来可以平安无事
You would have been safe.

这事不能继续
This must not be.This must not be.

这事必须继续
This must be.

巫魔女！
Witch.

你不能...
Nothing good will come of this.

不！你不能进去！
No. You can't.

卡丽熙！
Khaleesi

站住 马王
No further, horselord.

您伤着了？
Are you hurt?

...要生了
The baby... Is coming.

把接生婆找来！ 她们不肯来
Fetch the midwives. They will not come.

她们说她是被诅咒的人
They say she is cursed.

她们要么过来 要么我就把她们的头砍了
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

女巫...女巫会接生
The witchshe can bring baby.

我听见她说的
I hear her say so.

痛吗 我的狮子？
Are you in agony, my lion?

不疼 可你的表情挺痛苦的
No. You look like you're in agony.

细皮嫩肉都给火焰烤到啦...
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

去你的 女人 你没有痛觉么？
Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?

只是习惯了 你喝
Just used to it. Drink.

我们来玩个新游戏
Let's play a new game.

我知道一个布拉佛斯的匕首游戏...
There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you

这游戏没有掉手指头的危险吧？
Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?

赢了就不会 不玩！
Not if you win. No!

玩火 玩刀的都一边儿去
No more fire games, no knife games.

来玩个我拿手的
Let's do something I'm good at.

你什么拿手？
What are you good at?

我自认看人很准
I happen to be a great judge of character.

似乎是个无聊的游戏 才怪
This sounds like a boring game. It's not.

游戏规则很简单：我说出你的经历
Here's how it works: I make a statement

说对了 你喝
about your past. If I'm right,

说错了 我喝
you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink.

别撒谎 撒谎是瞒不过我的
And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.

我不想玩这个
I don't want to play this game.

好吧 波隆先来
Fine. Bronn first.

你老爹打过你
Your father beat you.

我老娘打得更狠
But my mother hit harder.

没满十二岁你就开了杀戒 你的对手 你宰了他
You killed your first man before you were 12.

那是个女人
It was a woman.

她抡斧子砍我
She swung an axe at me.

你去过长城北边
You've been North of the Wall.

去那边做什么？
What brought you up there?

工作
Work.

还有...
And...

你很多年前真心爱过一个女人
You once loved a woman many years ago,

却发现自己上了恶当 于是你再也不相信爱情了
but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again.

噢等等 那是我的故事
Oh wait, that's me.

到你了 神秘的东洋美女
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

我说了不想玩
I don't want to play.

这多有趣啊！你看我们玩得多开心
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

你娘是个妓女
Your mother was a whore.

你喝
Drink.

好吧
All right.

你爹在你很小的时候就离家出走
Your father left the family when you were very young,

一去不回 你喝
never to return. Drink.

咱们不是说好只说实话吗？
And we've established the rules about lying?

你喝！
Drink!

你想改变生活
You wanted a different life.

换个地方重新开始
You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.

这可以形容这操蛋世界里的每个人
The whole shitstained world could drink off that one.

那就说具体点...
So specifics

你想换换手气 可为什么要来这里？
you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?

肯定不是想来当静默姐妹
I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you.

一个出身低微的女孩能做什么呢...
So what's a lowborn girl to do?

你喝
Drink.

你确定... 你喝！
Are you suredrink!

再别谈论我的父母
And don't talk about my mother and father ever

不然我把你眼珠子抠出来
or I will carve your eyes from your head.

亲爱的小姐 如有冒犯之处 我深表歉意
My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize.

现在该我问了
My turn.

好 好
Fine fine.

尽管提问
Ask away.

看你有什么法子解开我这个谜
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

你爱过的女人是谁？ 这不合游戏规则
Who were you in love with? That's not how the game works.

我才不管什么游戏规则
I don't care the way the game works.

我们这位大人结过婚
Our Lord here used to be married.

结过婚？ 你从哪听来的？
Married? How did you hear that?

跟兰尼斯特家的兵玩骰子可以听到不少故事
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

改天我或许会告诉你
Another night, perhaps.

不 就今晚
Not another night. This night.

这是个蛮伤感的故事
It's not a pleasant story.

也许我会哭哦 我猜这位小姐
Or maybe I will cry. I'm guessing the lady and I

和我的伤心事可比大人你多啊
can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship.

好吧...
So...

那年我十六岁 我老哥詹姆和我骑马回来
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding

只听一声尖叫 她朝路上跑来
when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road,

衣服扯破了 后面跟了两个男人
clothes half torn off with two men on her heels.

詹姆几下就把他们赶跑了 我则用自己的斗蓬裹住她
Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

那女孩惊慌失措 不敢一个人走路
She was too scared to send off on her own,

詹姆又一心只想逮着强奸犯
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers

于是只能由我带她到附近的旅馆吃东西
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

她叫泰莎
Her name was Tysha.

是个车轮匠的遗孤
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

她很饿
And she was hungry

我俩足足吃了三只烤鸡 又喝干一整壶酒
together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.

现在看来不可思议 但当时的我不会喝酒
Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

我乱了性 忘了自己有多害怕女孩们
I forgot how afraid I was around girls,

怕她们嘲笑我
how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me

怕她们看见我就扭过头去
or look away embarrassed

怕她们夸奖我那高大英俊的老哥
or ask me about my tall handsome brother.

我眼里只有泰莎
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

于是我跟她上了床
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

三只烤鸡啊 总不能白吃
For three chickens, I should hope so.

我的第一次 我他妈还没闹清楚就完事了...
It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

但她对我很好
But she was good to me.

事后吻了我
She kissed me afterwards

还给我唱了一首歌
and sang me a song.

到隔天清晨 我已经爱上她了 便向她求婚
And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

讲几句谎话 塞几枚金币 再找个喝醉酒的修士
A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon

就这么成了...一对小夫妻
and there you have itman and wife.

两个星期后 那修士酒醒
For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up

便把事情禀报我老爸
and told my father.

你的婚姻到此结束
I imagine that was the end of all that.

不 结果更惨
Not quite.

老爸先要我老哥跟我说实话
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

其实...那女孩是个妓女
The girl was a whore, you see.

从那条路到那两个强奸犯
Jaime had arranged the whole thing,

整件事都是詹姆安排好的
the road, the rapersall of it.

他认为让我体验男女之事的时刻到了
He thought it was time I had a woman.

詹姆坦白之后
After my brother confessed,

老爸把我老婆叫进来
my father brought in my wife

交给他手下的卫兵
and gave her to his guards.

他出的价挺公道...一人一枚银币
He paid her wella silver for each man.

你说多少妓女值这个价？
How many whores command that kind of price?

他还逼我在军营里全程观赏
He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.

到后来她赚的银币多到拿不完
By the end, she had so much silver

白花花的银子顺着指缝
that the coins were slipping through her fingers

洒了一地
and rolling onto the floor.

有人敢这样对我 我非宰了他不可
I would have killed the man who did that to me.

你早该知道她是个婊子
You should have known she was a whore.

是吗？
Really?

我才十六岁 被爱情冲昏了头脑...
I was 16, drunk and in love

没有哪个险遭强暴的正常女孩
A girl who was almost raped

过两小时又去诱惑别的男人
doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.

是啊 我当时太傻太天真
As I said, I was young and stupid.

你现在也是又傻又天真
You are still young and stupid.

怎么了？你要干嘛？
What is it? What do you want?

还睡！打算贻误军机吗？
You're sleeping through the war.

什么？ 他们趁夜色抢先出击
What? They stole a night's march on us.

此刻就在北方一里处
They're a mile north.

叫侍从来帮我！ 你没有侍从
Get my squire! You don't have a squire.

如果我死了 要为我掉眼泪
If I die, weep for me.

你人都死了 怎么会知道？
You'll be dead. How will you know?

我就是知道
I'll know.

让开！
Watch out! Move!

别挡道！
Out of the way!

让开！
Move aside!

趴低点
stay low.

趴低点？
Stay low?

运气好的话 没人会注意到你
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

这么说我打娘胎里出来就是幸运儿
I was born lucky.

谷地的勇士们！
Tribesmen of the Vale,

集合！
gather round!

石鸦部！
Stone Crows!

黑耳部！灼人部！
Black Ears! Burned Men!

月人部！ 还有我们画犬部
Moon brothers! And painted dogs!

画犬部！
And painted dogs!

你们统治谷地的机会来了！
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

勇往直前 夺取一切！
Onward to claim what is yours!

半人万岁！半人万岁！
Half man! Half man!

半人万岁！半人万岁！
Half man! Half man!

半人万岁！半人万岁！
Half man! Half man!

冲啊
To battle.

你真是不经打
You're a shit warrior.

我没死吧？
I'm alive?

你没死
You're alive.

我们赢了？
Did we win?

没赢我们有命聊天？
We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.

那些原住民打得怎样？
How did our tribesmen do?

还凑合
Yeah, good.

好歹他们在战场上没打自己人
It's nice to see them getting along.

你受伤了
You're wounded.

谢谢您的关注哟
Good of you to notice.

听说我们赢了
I hear we won.

哼 探子的情报有误
Hmph. The scouts were wrong.

史塔克军只有两千 并非两万
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

那我们逮住史塔克小鬼了？
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

他不在这
He wasn't here.

在哪？
Where was he?

自然是带着他剩下的一万八千人马
With his other 18,000 men.

那他们又在哪？
And where are they?

去安全的地方吧 夫人 不
We should go, My Lady. No!

夫人！
My Lady!

等他们反应过来 木已成舟
By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.

史塔克夫人 很乐意为您效劳
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,

可惜我的剑不知掉哪儿去了
but I seem to have lost it.

我不需要你的效劳
It's not your sword I want.

我要我的两个女儿
Give me my daughters back.

以及我的丈夫回来
Give me my husband.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 国王舅舅 “弑君者”

恐怕我也不知他们到哪儿去了
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

杀了他 罗柏 把他的头还给他父亲
Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father.

你亲眼看见 他砍倒了十个我们的人
He cut down 10 of our menyou saw him.

他活着比较有用
He's more use to us alive than dead.

把他带走 戴上镣铐
Take him away and put him in irons.

小鬼 我们可以在这里结束战争
We could end this war right now, boy,

省得生灵涂炭
save thousands of lives.

你代表史塔克家 我代表兰尼斯特家
You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters.

用剑用枪 用牙齿用指甲...你来挑
Swords or lances, teeth, nailschoose your weapons

咱俩就在这里分个高下
and let's end this here and now.

弑君者 照你说的方式来
If we do it your way, Kingslayer,

你肯定会赢
you'd win.

我们有自己的方式
We're not doing it your way.

滚吧 小白脸
Come on, pretty man.

我让二千人去送死
I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.

吟游诗人将传唱他们的牺牲
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

这对死人来说又有什么意义呢？
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

一次胜利不代表我们就成了征服者
One victory does not make us conquerors.

我们从王后手中救出我父亲了吗？
Did we free my father?

救出我妹妹们了吗？
Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen?

我们打败了那些企图奴役北境的恶人了吗？
Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees?

战争还远未结束
This war is far from over.

可以给我一个么？
Could I have one?

柠檬...或是什么口味都好
A lemon oneor any of them.

三个铜币
Three coppers.

艾莉亚・史塔克
临冬城公爵次女

一只上好的肥鸽跟你换？
How about a nice fat pigeon?

滚吧你 滚！
Piss off now. Go on.

昨天没卖出去的也行
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?

烤糊了的也行 快滚！
Or any burnt ones? Piss off!

嘿 大家都去哪儿？发生了什么事？
Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?

他要被带到贝勒大圣堂
They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.

带谁？
Who?

首相啊！
The Hand of the King.

国贼！ 懦夫！
Traitor! Coward!

尤伦
守夜人 “浪鸦”

Lord of Winterfell

暨国王之手

我当着天上诸神和地上凡人的面
I come before you to confess my treason

承认我的叛国罪行
in the sight of Gods and men.

我背叛了我的国王和挚友劳勃...
I betrayed the faith of my King

...的信任与托付
and the trust of my friend Robert.

我发誓保护他的孩子
I swore to protect and defend his children,

然而他尸骨未寒
but before his blood was cold

我却阴谋杀害他的儿子...
I plotted to murder his son...

并自立为王
And seize the Throne for myself.

国贼！
Traitor!

请总主教和“受神爱护的”贝勒
Let the high Septon

为我所说的作见证：
and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say:

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
Joffrey Baratheon

乃铁王座唯一合法的继承人
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne,

以天上七神之名
by the Grace of all the gods,

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

他是七国统治者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

与全境守护者
and Protector of the Realm.

因为我们有罪
As we sin,

所以我们受苦
so do we suffer.

此人当着天上诸神与地上凡人的面
This man has confessed his crimes

派席尔
大学士

坦承其罪行
in sight of Gods and men.

天上诸神是公正的
The Gods are just

然而“受神祝福的”贝勒曾教导我们
but beloved Baelor taught us

他们也是仁慈的
they can also be merciful.

国王陛下
What is to be done

请问该如何处置这名叛徒呢？
with this traitor, Your Grace?

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

我的母亲敦请我让艾德公爵加入守夜人
My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

剥夺其一切头衔与权利
Stripped of all titles and powers,

终生流放长城为王国服役
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

而我的珊莎小姐
And My Lady Sansa

也多次为她父亲求情
has begged mercy for her father.

但那是她们软弱的妇女心肠使然
But they have the soft hearts of women.

只要我一日为王
So long as I am your King,

叛国之罪必将严惩！
treason shall never go unpunished.
