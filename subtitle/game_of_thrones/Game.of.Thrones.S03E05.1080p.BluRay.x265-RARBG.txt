光之王 请光耀此人 您的仆从

他的火焰已然熄灭

因为长夜漫漫 处处险恶
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

光之王 请…   艾莉亚 别！
Lord, cast... Arya, don't!

将他从死亡与黑暗中带回
Bring him back from death and darkness...

不！
No!

放开我！放开我！
Let go of me! Let me go!

看起来他们的神更偏爱我甚过你的屠夫小子
Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.

烧死在地狱里！
Burn in hell!

他最终会的
He will.

但不是今天
But not today.

Tell me what you know.

巡逻四个人一队
There are four to a patrol

两个工匠检查建筑缺损
two builders to check for structural damage,

两个游骑兵放哨

多久巡逻一次
How often do these patrols go out?

要看情况
It varies.

如果我知道要去的是哪段长城 我就能告诉你了
If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.

你倒是想
You'd like to know that.

长城沿线有19座城堡

黑城堡里还剩多少人？
How many men remain in Castle Black?

1000 骗子
1,000. Liar.

如果我杀了你 你的老鹰会怎样？
What happens to your eagle after I kill you?

它会像断线的风筝一样飘走？
Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut

还是会一头摔死？
or does he just flop dead to the ground?

他已经不是乌鸦了
He's no crow.

你想要他不是乌鸦 他就不是了吗
Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.

我可不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

我挺喜欢你 孩子
I like you, boy.

但如果你敢对我撒谎
But if you lie to me,

我就把你的肠子从喉咙扯出来
I'll pull your guts out through your throat.

一千个人
1,000 men.

我们很快就知道真假了
We'll find out soon enough.

我不需要你保护我
I don't need you to protect me.

你当然需要
Of course you do.

叮当衫要杀你的时候谁救了你？
Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?

谁为你向曼斯担保？
Who vouched for you with Mance?

你似乎还欠着我人情呢
It seems you owe me a debt.

还给我  好吧 我把它偷了
Give it back. Well, I stole it.

它就是我的了 如果你想要 就偷回来啊
It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.

耶哥蕊特！

Ygritte!

Ygritte! Seven hells.

耶哥蕊特！
Ygritte!

欧瑞尔说对了吗？
Is Orell right?

你还是只乌鸦？
Are you still a crow?

是证明你自己的时候了
It's time you proved yourself.

耶哥蕊特
Ygritte.

你许过的誓言
You swore some vows.

我要你破掉
I want you to break 'em.

我要你看我
I want you to see me.

我的全部
All of me.

我们不该这样
We shouldn't.

正该这样
We should.

你干嘛还不脱？
Why are you still dressed?

你什么都不懂 琼恩 雪… 
You know nothing, Jon Sno

你做的那个
That thing you did

用嘴做的那个
with your mouth

南方的老爷跟夫人之间是那样的吗？
is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?

我不知道
I don't know.

我就是想亲亲你 仅此而已
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

嗯
Hmm.

你好像挺喜欢呀
You seemed to like it.

是啊 我有点喜欢
Aye, I liked it some.

谁教你的？
Who taught you that?

没人教过我 我只有你
There's been no one else. Only you.

处子
A maid.

你还是个处子
You were a maid.

我曾是守夜人
I was a man of the Night's Watch.

你呢？你是第一次吗？
How about you? Were you a maid?

你觉得呢？
What do you think?

那个他是谁？ 就个普通的男孩
Who was he? Just a boy.

他来和他的兄弟们做买卖
He came trading with his brothers.

他跟我一样是红发 火吻而生
He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire.

但是… 
But...

他是个软蛋
he was weak.

比不上你
Not like you.

他是我的第一个
That was the first one.

然后是个瑟恩的男孩
Then there was this Thenn boy.

不会说通用语 可神呐 他壮得像头猛犸
Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.

嗯 谢了 我想我听够了
Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough.

我们最好回去了
We'd best get back.

托蒙德… 
Tormund

我俩的事儿还没完呢
I'm not done with you yet.

你有多久没洗澡了？
How long's it been since you had a bath?

我们别回去了
Let's not go back.

我们在这多待一会儿
Let's stay here a while longer.

琼恩 雪诺 我想永远都不离开这座洞穴
I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

永远都不
Not ever.

还我钱
I want my gold.

借条上写得很清楚
It says it clearly right there on that note

战争结束后我们就会尽数偿还
you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.

放你个屁！你们就是一群小贼
Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.

我们是法外之徒，自然要雁过拔毛
We're outlaws. Outlaws steal.

我们没杀你已经算你走运
You're lucky we didn't kill you.

那来试试啊 弓箭手
Come try it, archer.

我会把那些箭都捅进你的屁眼里
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.

你们不能放他走 他是杀人犯 他有罪
You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.

光之王不是这么看的 你们不能放！
Not in the eyes of god. You can't!

够了！我等无权裁定
Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.

安静地离开吧 桑铎 克里冈
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.

光之王和你还未了结
The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.

给骑兵让路！
Riders coming through!

洛克

布蕾妮・塔斯

“美人” 凯特琳的护卫

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者” 御林铁卫队长

弑君者
The Kingslayer.

跪下！
Down!

跪下
On your knees.

波顿大人 我给你献上弑君者
Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡伯爵

拉他起来 洛克
Pick him up, Locke.

你少了一只手
You've lost a hand.

不 大人 手在这儿呢
No, my lord, he has it here.

把这拿走 送给他父亲？
Take this away. Send it to his father?

不想丢掉舌头就给我闭嘴
You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.

放开她 抱歉 小姐
Cut her free. Apologies, my lady.

你们现在在我保护之下
You're under my protection now.

谢谢您 大人
Thank you, my lord.

给我们的客人找个合适的房间
Find suitable rooms for our guests.

我们稍后再谈
We'll speak later.

波顿大人
Lord Bolton.

君临那有新消息了吗？
Is there word from the capital?

你不知道？
You haven't heard?

史坦尼斯围攻了君临城
Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.

舰队开进了黑水湾
Sailed into Blackwater Bay.

上千人冲击城门
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.

而你的姐姐… 
And your sister...

该怎么说呢？
How can I put this?

你姐姐她… 
Your sister...

她活得好好的
is alive and well.

你父亲一方胜利了
Your father's forces prevailed.

詹姆爵士身体不舒服
Ser Jaime isn't well.

带他去见科本
Take him to Qyburn.

科本

我会死吗？ 不会
Will I die? No.

腐疮已经扩散了
The corruption has spread.

恐怕得切掉
I fear it must be cut away.

最周全的办法是截掉整条手臂
The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.

那你就死定了
Then you'll die.

你不是学士
You're no maester.

你的颈链哪去了？
Where's your chain?

学城剥夺了我的颈链
The Citadel stripped me of it.

他们觉得我的一些实验… 
They found some of my experiments

太大胆了
too bold.

我可以保住你的上臂 从肘部开始截
I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.

我不用右手就可以干掉你
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

我可以只移除腐肉
I can take away the rotting flesh

试着用沸酒处理掉
and try and burn out the corruption

腐烂的部分 嗯
with boiling wine. Mmm.

运气好的话 这样的处理就管用了
With any luck, that will suffice.

我去拿罂粟花奶
You'll need milk of the poppy.

不要 这会很痛
No milk of the poppy. There will be pain.

我可以尖叫 会痛彻心扉
I'll scream. Quite a bit of pain.

那我可以厉声惨叫
I'll scream loudly.

培提尔・贝里席
“小指头” 赫伦堡公爵

贝里席大人
Lord Baelish.

太后殿下
Your Grace.

可否请你帮个忙
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

当然可以 殿下
Of course, Your Grace.

我有理由怀疑提利尔家族
I have reason to believe that House Tyrell

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

并不真心为了王室谋益
do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.

哦 那您有没有将您的怀疑告知泰温大人？
I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

我父亲是个脚踏实地的人 他偏爱事实
My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.

我反而认为事实是一种对真相的阻碍
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

如你所知 他很欣赏那些愿意助兰尼斯特一臂之力的人
And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.

对于肯帮助我们的人 我的父亲有多慷慨大方
He's almost as generous to those who help us

对不肯帮助我们的人 他就有多冷酷无情
as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.

你和提利尔家关系不错
You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.

我想你也许愿意在离开君临前 调查一下他们
I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.

我会尽力的 谢谢
I shall do my best. Thank you.

希望你能比让你找回艾莉亚那次做得好一些
And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

我向您保证
I assure you that it will.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔” 财政大臣

神啊 孩子够了够了 我们又不在酒馆里
Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.

波德瑞克・派恩
提利昂的侍从

奥莲娜夫人
玛格丽・提利尔的祖母

对不起 夫人 不必说了
Pardon, my lady. No need to speak.

有无花果吗？拿来点
Are there any figs? Fetch some.

我下午的时候总是吃点无花果
I always take figs midafternoon.

可以助消化
They help move the bowels.

你叫我来有何贵干？
To what do I owe this summons?

谢谢您的拜访 夫人
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

我有一些财政事务想与您商讨一二
I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.

我爬了这么多楼梯就是为了来讨论财政事务？
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?

其实是王家婚礼的事
It's the royal wedding.

我听说您也参与筹备这件事
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

那是自然
Naturally.

此事已经牵涉众多
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

他们说这场婚礼太奢侈了
The word extravagant has been used.

要是奢侈这个字眼都不能用来形容一场王家婚礼
What good is the word extravagant

要它何用？
if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?

这点我理解 很好
I understand that. Good.

但是 作为财政大臣 我身负重任
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me

要盘点王室支出
to calculate the cost for the crown.

目前为止 这已是一笔巨额支出
As of now, it's a huge expense.

但是？
And?

但是我们正处于战争中 奥莲娜夫人
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

哦 你不说我都快忘了
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

是的 支撑补给线需要… 
Yes, and maintaining supply lines

真不明白我怎么才能把这些事都忘了
I can't think how it slipped my mind.

提利尔家族提供了多少人来着
What is it, 12,000 infantrymen

12,000名步兵？
the Tyrell family has supplied?

1,800名长枪骑兵
1,800 mounted lances.

2,000人预备队
2,000 in support.

还有足够君临熬过冬天的补给品
Provisions so this city might survive the winter.

一百万斗小麦
A million bushels of wheat.

大麦、燕麦和黑麦各五十万斗
Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.

两万头牛
20,000 head of cattle.

五万头羊
50,000 sheep.

你不用给我上课
You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses.

战时开支这方面我熟悉的很
I'm quite familiar with them.

您家族的贡献我们感激在心
And we are so grateful for your contributions

为了维系王国它们必不可少
which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.

说到那场王家婚礼
As is a royal wedding.

民众渴求的不仅仅是食物
The people are hungry for more than just food.

他们渴望能转移注意力的东西
They crave distractions.

如果我们不给他们这种东西 他们会自己造一个
And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.

他们会很乐意通过把我们撕成碎片
And their distractions are likely to end

来彻底转移注意力
with us being torn to pieces.

来一场王家婚礼会安全得多
A royal wedding is much safer.

你说对吗？ 对的
Wouldn't you say? I would.

根据传统 开支应由
And traditionally paid for

皇室家族来承担
by the royal family.

我听说你是个酒鬼 为人粗鲁
I was told you were drunk, impertinent,

一个彻头彻尾的浪荡子
and thoroughly debauched.

你可以想象 当我看到你只是一个
You can imagine my disappointment

战战兢兢的记账员时有多失望
at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

你去哪儿搞到的无花果 瓦兰提斯？
Where did you go for them, Volantis?

夫人…  噢 好了好了
My ladyOh, very well.

我不会让别人说提利尔家族
I won't have it said that House Tyrell

袖手旁观的
refuses to play its part.

我们会负责半数的开支
We'll pay for half the expenses

并且庆典也会如期举行
and the celebrations will go on as planned.

这样够了吧？ 完全足够 谢谢您
Is that sufficient? Quite sufficient. Thank you.

非常好 就这么定了 日安
Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

给我也来点
Give me that.

你在干什么？
What are you doing?

在修理贝里大人的盔甲
Just mending Lord Beric's armor.

为什么？
Why?

我想留下来 为兄弟会当铁匠
I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.

你疯了吗？
Have you lost your mind?

当兰尼斯特找到这里 你认为他们会放过铁匠？
When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths?

他们会把你的脑袋塞进你自己打造的头盔里
They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.

我不加入兄弟会  兰尼斯特也早就想杀我了
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.

你没必要这样做
You don't have to do this.

我想这样做
I want to.

他们需要人才
They need good men.

罗柏也需要人才 我们明天走吧
Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow.

然后你就可以…  什么？给他干活？
And then youWhat? Serve him?

我一辈子都在给别人干活
I've served men my entire life.

我给君临的莫特师父干活
I served Master Mott at King's Landing

然后他把我卖给了守夜人
and he sold me to the Watch.

我给赫伦堡的泰温大人干活
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,

每天都提心吊胆会不会被拷打或者处死
wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.

我不想再给别人干活了
I'm done serving.

你刚才说你要为贝里大人干活
You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

他是他们的领袖 但也是他们选出来的
He may be their leader, but they chose him.

这些人情同手足 就像一家人一样
These men are brothers. They're a family.

我从来都没有过一个家
I've never had a family.

我可以做你的家人
I can be your family.

你不会是我的家人的
You wouldn't be my family.

你只会是“小姐”
You'd be "my lady."

威廉・兰尼斯特

马丁・兰尼斯特

威廉
Willem.

威廉！
Willem!

有人来救我们了？ 兰尼斯特贱种！抓住他！
Is this a rescue? Lannister filth! Take him!

求你了 我什么都没做 我只是个侍从
Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire.

求你… 
Please

泰丽莎・梅葛亚
小护士 罗柏的王后

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

把他们带进来
Bring them in.

布林登・徒利
“黑鱼” 凯特琳・徒利之叔

瑞卡德・卡史塔克
卡霍城伯爵

一共就这几个？
Is that all of them?

你们五个身强力壮的汉子去谋害两个手无寸铁的侍从？
It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?

这不是谋害 陛下
Not murder, Your Grace.

是复仇
Vengeance.

复仇？
Vengeance?

你的儿子不是这几个孩子杀的
Those boys didn't kill your sons.

我亲眼见到哈利昂战死沙场 托伦… 
I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen

被弑君者勒死
Was strangled by the Kingslayer.

他们是他的亲族 他们只是孩子！
They were his kin. They were boys!

看着他们
Look at them.

叫你母亲去看
Tell your mother to look at them.

凯特琳・徒利
艾德・史塔克的遗孀

她和我有同样的责任
She killed them as much as I.

我母亲与此事毫无瓜葛
My mother had nothing to do with this.

这是你的背叛之举
This was your treason.

放走敌人才是背叛
It's treason to free your enemies.

打仗的时候 你得杀掉你的敌人
In war, you kill your enemies.

你父亲没教过你吗 小子？
Did your father not teach you that, boy?

别动他
Leave him.

很好
Aye.

让国王来处置我
Leave me to the king.

他打算轻描淡写地斥责我几句 然后加以原谅
He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.

艾德慕・徒利
奔流城公爵 凯特琳・徒利之弟

他就是这样处理叛徒的
That's how he deals with treason.

我们的北境之王
Our King in the North.

我是不是该改口称您为
Or should I call him

失去北境之王？
the King Who Lost the North?

押送卡史塔克大人去地牢
Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.

吊死其他人
Hang the rest.

发发慈悲吧 大人！我一个人也没杀
Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.

只是替他们看门
I only watched for the guards.

这个人只负责看门
This one was only the watcher.

最后一个吊死他 好让他看着其他人死去
Hang him last so he can watch the others die.

求你了！求你了 不要 他们逼我这么做的！
Please! Please, no. They made me do it!

他们逼我的！他们逼我的！
They made me! They made me!

这件事决不能传出奔流城
Word of this can't leave Riverrun.

他们是泰温・兰尼斯特的侄子
They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.

兰尼斯特有债必还
The Lannisters pay their debts.

他们都这么说
They never stop talking about it.

你要我既当杀人犯 又当骗子吗？
Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?

我们无需说谎
It wouldn't be lying.

把他们埋掉 一句也不提
We will bury them and remain silent

直到战争结束
until the war is done.

无论凶手出身多么高贵
I'm not fighting for justice

如果我不能对凶手施以公正的裁决
if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks,

那么我就不是为了正义而战
no matter how highborn.

他必须死
He has to die.

卡史塔克家是北方人
The Karstarks are Northmen.

他们不会原谅你杀了他们的领主
They won't forgive the killing of their lord.

你母亲是对的
Your mother's right.

如果你这样做了 你会失去卡史塔克家
If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.

你给他们包扎过伤口
You tended to their wounds.

你给他们送过饭 现在他们死了
You brought them supper. Now they're dead.

在战争结束前还会有更多的男孩死去
And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.

你需要卡史塔克的人去结束这一切
You need Karstark men to end it.

饶过他的性命 把他当做人质
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

作为人质
A hostage.

告诉卡史塔克家 只要他们仍旧效忠
Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal,

他就安然无恙
he will not be harmed.

先民的血液不止流在你体内
The blood of the First Men flows through my veins

也流在我体内 小子
as much as yours, boy.

我为你父亲和疯王打仗
I fought the Mad King for your father.

为你与乔佛里王作对
I fought Joffrey for you.

史塔克和卡史塔克
We are kin

我们是血肉难分的亲人
Stark and Karstark.

血脉不能阻止你背叛我
That didn't stop you from betraying me.

也不能拯救你
And it won't save you now.

我没指望它拯救我
I don't want it to save me.

我希望它能折磨你到死
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.

跪下 大人
Kneel, my lord.

瑞卡德・卡史塔克
Rickard Karstark,

卡霍城伯爵
Lord of Karhold,

在诸神与世人的见证下 我宣判你死刑
here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.

你有遗言吗？
Would you speak a final word?

快快杀了我 接受诅咒吧
Kill me and be cursed.

你不是我的国王了
You are no king of mine.

乔佛里国王
Joffrey.

瑟曦太后
Cersei.

伊林・派恩
Ilyn Payne.

马林爵士
Ser Meryn.

猎狗
The Hound.

你要怎么处置我？
What are you going to do with me?

天一亮我们就去奔流城
At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.

你哥哥现在在那儿
Your brother's there now.

他会为我们的事业助力
He'll make a contribution to our cause

而你也可以回家了
and you can go home.

我是个人质 你要拿我换赎金
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

事情不像你认为的这样
Don't think of it that way.

但事情就是这样 是的
But it is that way. It is.

但也不是 是的部分大于不是的
And it isn't. More is than isn't.

你知道 贝里很仰慕你的父亲
Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.

他想要把你送回去 不要赎金
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

为什么不呢？ 我们需要金子
So why don't you? We need the gold.

我吓着你了吗 孩子？
Do I frighten you, child?

没
No.

你在生我的气
You're angry with me.

我不怪你
And I don't blame you.

但是放他走是对的
But letting him go was the right thing.

我有无数的理由想要吊死他
I have more reason than most to want him hanged.

我以为他杀了你 他是这么做了
I thought he killed you. He did.

但是… ？
But how...?

索罗斯… 
Thoros...

你把我救回来多少次了？
how many times have you brought me back?

是光之王把你救回来的
It's the Lord of Light brings you back.

我只是个碰巧念了祷词的醉鬼
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

多少次？ 五次吧 大概是
How many times? Five, I think.

不 算上这次是六次
No, this makes six.

那就是六次
Six.

第一次是… 魔山
There was the first timethe Mountain.

给她看
Show her.

骑枪正中胸膛
Lance right through the chest.

然后是腹部被刺穿
Then I was stabbed in the belly.

然后是背上中箭
Then it was an arrow in the back.

还有侧面的斧伤
And that axe in the side.

后来兰尼斯特抓住了我 处以叛国罪
Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.

是被吊死的还是被匕首刺入眼睛？
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

一起来的 那帮怂货不知道该选哪样
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

最后猎狗来了第六次
And the Hound makes six.

我被克里冈家的人杀死的第二次
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

你以为你得到教训了
You'd think you'd learn.

这不会越来越容易的 你知道
It's not getting any easier, you know.

我明白
I know.

每次我活过来
Every time I come back,

都觉得自己更不完整
I'm a bit less.

记忆和生命渐渐离我而去
Pieces of you get chipped away.

你能把没了头的人救回来吗？
Could you bring back a man without a head?

不用六次 一次就行
Not six times. Just once.

我不认为那能管用 孩子
I don't think it works that way, child.

他是个好人 奈德・史塔克
He was a good man, Ned Stark.

他现在已在某处安息了
He's at rest now, somewhere.

我可不希望他像我一样
I would never wish my life upon him.

我希望
I would.

至少你还活着
You're alive.

光之王 光耀我身
Lord, cast your light upon me.

护吾于暗
Protect me in the darkness.

燃尽吾罪
Burn away my sins.

赛丽丝?佛罗伦
史坦尼斯?拜拉席恩的王后

助吾侍奉
Help me serve you.

任主驱策
Use me as you will.

因为长夜黑暗
For the night is dark

处处险恶
and full of terrors.

我日夜祈祷你能来看我
I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
狭海中的王

夫人
My lady.

我本想早点来
I meant to come sooner.

但战斗…  我知道您的麻烦 陛下
The battleI know of your troubles, my king.

梅丽珊卓夫人把所有事都告诉我了
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

是的 当然
Yes, of course.

您不能丧失信心 您信仰的是真神
You mustn't despair. Your claim is true.

您会凯旋的 我也曾经这么以为
You will be victorious. I believed that once.

你是唯一的神选中的人
You are the one god's champion

也是我见过的最正直的人
and the finest man I've ever known.

赛丽丝
Selyse.

我打破了神圣的誓言
I've broken a sacred vow.

我有罪
I've sinned.

不  我做了对不起你的事
No. I've wronged you.

我令你蒙羞  你不过是在执行神赐的使命
I have shamed you. You're doing god's work.

你不明白
You don't understand.

那红袍女… 
The Red Woman

是梅丽珊卓夫人… 
the Lady Melisandre

我知道 史坦尼斯
I know, Stannis.

梅丽珊卓夫人已经全都告诉我了
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

为服侍光之王而做的事
No act done in service of the Lord of Light

绝不会是罪恶的
can ever be a sin.

当她告诉我的时候
When she told me,

我喜极而泣
I wept with joy.

哦 我可爱的男孩们
Oh, my sweet boys.

培提尔 托蒙德
Petyr, Tommard,

艾德利克
Edric.

我每日都在感谢着神
I thank god every day

因为他将梅丽珊卓带给我们
for bringing Melisandre to us.

她给了你一个儿子
She gave you a son.

而我… 
I gave you...

什么都没给  那不是真的
nothing. That's not true.

那你也是来看望她的？
So you've come to see her as well?

你不必这样做
There is no need.

你必须远离这些令你分神的事
You must keep away from such distractions.

她是我的女儿
She's my daughter.

我想看看她
I want to see her.

你是国王
You are a king.

你不需要请求我的允许
You don't need my permission.

海底下
? Under the sea ?

我知道 我知道
? I know, I know ?

噢噢噢
? Oh, oh, oh ?

鸟儿生鳞
? The birds have scales ?

鱼儿长翅
? And the fish take wing ?

我知道 我知道
? I know, I know ?

噢噢噢
? Oh, oh, oh... ?

希琳
Shireen.

希琳?拜拉席恩
史坦尼斯?拜拉席恩的女儿

父亲！
Father!

从我上次见你到现在你已经长了不少
You've grown since I last saw you.

母亲说你在打仗
Mother said you fought in a battle.

你赢了吗？
Did you win?

没有
No.

洋葱骑士和你一起回来了吗？
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

他回来了
He did.

他战斗的很英勇
He fought bravely.

他还没来看望过我
He hasn't come to visit me.

他说他会从都城带礼物给我
He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.

他不会来看你了 孩子
He won't be visiting, child.

为什么？他是我的朋友
Why not? He's my friend.

看
Look.

他给我做了这个
He made this for me.

但别告诉母亲
But don't tell Mother I have it.

这是个秘密
It's a secret.

母亲不喜欢洋葱骑士
Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

戴佛斯爵士是个叛徒
Ser Davos is a traitor.

他因自己犯下的罪而被关在地牢里
He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.

你最好忘了他
Best forget him.

别那么用力 你会把自己的皮蹭掉的
Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

你在这做什么？
What are you doing here?

我要洗个澡
I need a bath.

帮我把这身臭布脱掉
Help me out of these rags.

现在走吧
Now get out.

这里多的是池子
There's another tub.

我就看中这个
This one suits me fine.

别怕 我对你没兴趣
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

若见我昏厥 赶快把我拖出去
If I faint, pull me out.

没有哪个兰尼斯特是洗澡时淹死的 我可不想当头名
I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.

我干吗管你死活？
Why should I care how you die?

当然要管 你发下了神圣的誓言 忘了吗？
You swore a solemn vow, remember?

你本应把我安然无恙的护送到君临
You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.

不怎么顺利 是吧？
Not going so well, is it?

难怪你保不住蓝礼
No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.

你别这样 原谅我
That was unworthy. Forgive me.

你从头到尾细心保护 武艺也比旁人都强
You protected me better than most

你取笑我  我在道歉哪
Don't you mock me. I'm apologizing.

我吵累了
I'm sick of fighting.

咱们就不能停战么
Let's call a truce.

停战的基础是信任
You need trust to have a truce.

我信任你
I trust you.

瞧 又是这种眼神
There it is. There's the look.

我已经忍受了十七年
I've seen it for 17 years

一张又一张不信任的脸
on face after face.

你们都瞧不起我
You all despise me.

弑君者
Kingslayer.

背誓者
Oathbreaker.

没有荣誉的人
A man without honor.

你听说过野火吗？
You've heard of wildfire?

当然
Of course.

疯王对它着了魔
The Mad King was obsessed with it.

他喜欢看着人们被活活烧死
He loved to watch people burn,

他喜欢看着他们的表皮被烧的焦黑然后爆裂
the way their skin blackened and blistered

从他们的骨头上融化滴落
and melted off their bones.

他烧那些他讨厌的领主
He burned lords he didn't like.

他烧那些不遵从他命令的首相
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.

他烧所有敢于反对他的人
He burned anyone who was against him.

很快 半个国家都起来反抗他
Before long, half the country was against him.

伊里斯看谁都是叛徒
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.

他命火术士们将野火罐子
So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire

埋到全城各地
all over the city

从贝勒大圣堂底
beneath the Sept of Baelor

到跳蚤窝的陋屋
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

民居 马厩 与旅店甚至红堡的地窖内
Under houses, stables, taverns.

都有这些“水果”
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

最终
Finally,

他自食苦果的一天到来了
the day of reckoning came.

劳勃・拜拉席恩在三叉戟河得胜之后
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital

开始向都城进军
after his victory at the Trident.

但我的父亲带着兰尼斯特大军
But my father arrived first

抢先一步抵达
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

承诺自己是为勤王而来
promising to defend the city against the rebels.

但我更了解我的父亲
I knew my father better than that.

他绝不会站在失败者的一边
He's never been one to pick the losing side.

我告诉疯王这些
I told the Mad King as much.

我劝他老实投降
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

但国王不肯听我的
But the king didn't listen to me.

他也不听瓦里斯的警告
He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.

但他听从了国师派席尔的话
But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,

那个灰白 下垂的老贱货
that grey, sunken cunt.

“你要相信兰尼斯特” 他说
"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.

“兰尼斯特一直是
"The Lannisters have always been

王家真正的朋友”
true friends of the crown."

于是城门大开
So we opened the gates

我父亲的军队洗劫了城市
and my father sacked the city.

我再一次找到了国王
Once again, I came to the king,

敦请他投降
begging him to surrender.

而他要我… 
He told me to...

献上我父亲的人头… 
bring him my father's head.

然后他… 
Then he...

找到了他的火术士
turned to his pyromancer.

“烧光他们” 他说
"Burn them all," he said.

“把他们烧死在他们的房子里”
"Burn them in their homes.

“把他们烧死在睡梦中”
Burn them in their beds."

告诉我 如果你的宝贝蓝礼
Tell me, if your precious Renly

命令你杀死自己的父亲
commanded you to kill your own father

还要把成千上万的男人
and stand by while thousands of men,

女人 和孩子活活烧死
women, and children burned alive,

你会这么做吗？
would you have done it?

你会继续遵守你的誓言吗？
Would you have kept your oath then?

我先杀了那火术士
First, I killed the pyromancer.

然后国王转身要逃跑
And then when the king turned to flee,

我从后面一剑把他捅了个透心凉
I drove my sword into his back.

“烧光他们” 他一直这样说着
"Burn them all," he kept saying.

“烧光他们”
"Burn them all."

我认为其实他不是真的想死
I don't think he expected to die.

他… 他想要… 
Hehe meant to...

烧死我们所有人
burn with the rest of us

然后重生
and rise again,

化为真龙
reborn as a dragon

把他的敌人烧成灰烬
to turn his enemies to ash.

于是我割了他的喉咙 以保证他不会得逞
I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.

这时奈德・史塔克看到了我
That's where Ned Stark found me.

如果这是真的
If this is true...

为何无人知晓？
why didn't you tell anyone?

为什么你不告诉史塔克大人
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

史塔克？
Stark?

你以为
You think

高贵的临冬城公爵
the honorable Ned Stark

会来听取我无力的解释？
wanted to hear my side?

居然看着我
He judged me guilty

就认定我有罪
the moment he set eyes on me.

奔狼有什么资格
By what right does the wolf

来评判雄狮？
judge the lion?

有什么资格？  来人！救命！
By what right? Help! Help!

弑君者出事了！
The Kingslayer!

詹姆
Jaime.

我的名字叫詹姆
My name is Jaime.

洋葱骑士
Onion Knight.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

洋葱骑士
Ser Onion Knight.

公主殿下？诸神啊 你在这里做什么？
Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

嘘 你会吵醒伯特的  伯特？
Shh, you'll wake Bert. Bert?

他是那个胖守卫 他负责今晚的值班
He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.

但他喜欢喝酒 总是一醉不醒
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

快回你的房间去 你不应该来这里
Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here.

如果你的父亲知道了…  他说你是个叛徒
If your father knewHe said you were a traitor.

你真的是吗？
Are you?

是的 孩子
I am, child.

我违抗了国王的旨意 你父亲的旨意
I disobeyed my king, your father,

现在我为此付出了代价
and now I'm paying the price.

我不在乎 你是我的朋友
I don't care. You're my friend.

你在这一定很无聊
You must get bored down here.

我给你带书来看
I brought you something to read.

是关于伊耿和他的巨龙的
It's about Aegon and his dragons.

伊耿以前住在这里 你知道吗？
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?

坦格里安们建造了这座城堡  是啊
And the Targaryens built this castle. Aye.

他们建造了这座城堡  你可以把这本书藏在你的衣服下面
So they did. You can hide the book under your cloak.

这是本好书 我会带给你更多的
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

谢谢你 我的小姐 我肯定这是本好书
Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book,

但给我是种浪费
but it's wasted on me.

拿着它 我还有更多书呢
Take it. I have more.

可是小姐 我不识字
My lady, I can't read the words.

你不识字？
You can't?

我来教你吧 我会等伯特值班的时候回来教你
I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.

别这样  读书很简单 很有趣的
No. No. No. It's easy. It'll be fun.

走吧 我们不能  为什么不能
Go. We can't. Why not?

他们难道会把我们都关进牢房吗？
What will they do, lock us in cells?

我不知道从哪开始
I wouldn't know where to start.

就从头开始吧
At the beginning.

这个词是伊耿
This word is Aegon.

当你看到A E和G像这样在一起时
When you see A, E, and G together like that,

它听起来像伊戈
it sounds like egg.

而这本书的标题
And the title of the whole book

是“征服者伊耿传
is "An History of Aegon the Conqueror

暨维斯特洛征服史”
and His Conquest of Westeros."

那可真是场激烈的攻城战
It was a bitch of a siege.

嗯 你是第一个冲进派克城墙的缺口的？
Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?

第二个 密尔的索罗斯第一个冲了进去
The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone,

乔拉・莫尔蒙
“大熊” 熊老之子

挥舞着他的火焰剑
waving that flaming sword of his.

密尔的索罗斯 那个不要命的疯子
Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
前任御林铁卫队长

劳勃在那场战役之后册封你为骑士的？
Robert knighted you after the battle?

那是我生命中最值得骄傲的时刻
Proudest moment of my life.

单膝跪在地上 国王的剑则搭在我的肩上
One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder,

我听他说道
listening to the words.

“以战士之名令汝英勇无畏”
"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."

而我只想着要赶紧去撒泡尿
All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.

穿着全身的板甲整整16个小时
In full plate metal for 16 hours.

直到战斗结束之后才感到要撒尿
Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.

我几乎要成了第一个在被册封时在国王的靴子上撒尿的人
I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.

劳勃会为此哈哈大笑的
Robert would have laughed.

他是个好人 一个伟大的战士
He was a good man, a great warrior.

一个糟糕的国王
And a terrible king.

我花费如此多的时光在这个糟糕的国王的麾下战斗
I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.

你曾发下过誓言  是的
You swore an oath. Yes.

一个有荣誉的人会遵守他的诺言
And a man of honor keeps his vows,

即使他要服侍一个酒鬼 或是疯子
even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.

在我的生命中 这是第一次
Just once in my life before it's over,

我想知道带着骄傲去服侍
I want to know what it's like to serve with pride,

去为值得信任的人战斗 是什么样的感觉
to fight for someone I believe in.

你信任她吗？
Do you believe in her?

我全心全意的信任她
With all my heart.

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

就是这些人了？
These are the ones?

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
风暴降生 龙之母

是的 卡丽熙 无垢者军官们
Yes, khaleesi. The officers.

你们没有选择要过这样的生活

而你们现在是自由人了 自由人做出他们自己的决定

你们自己从队伍中选出了军官吗？

摘下你的头盔

小人有幸为您效劳

你叫什么名字？

灰虫子

灰虫子

所有的无垢者男童在被阉割时
All Unsullied boys are given new names

都起了新的名字
when they are cut

灰虫子 红跳蚤 黑鼠
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

这些名字都是在提醒他们 自己的身份
Names that remind them what they are

害虫
vermin.

从今往后 你可以自己挑选自己的姓名

告诉你的战友们 他们也可以这么做

丢弃你们的奴隶姓名

你们可以选择使用父母给你们的姓名或是任何其他的

足以给你们尊严的姓名

灰虫子这个名字可以使我感到尊严

这是一个幸运的名字

而我诞生的名字被下了诅咒

那是我被迫为奴时使用的姓名

而灰虫子这个名字

是丹尼莉丝风暴降生解放我时我所使用的姓名

劳勃国王要她的命
King Robert wanted her dead.

当然他想致她于死地
Of course he wanted her dead.

她是坦格利安家族的后人 是家族最后的血脉
She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

我猜御前议会里已经无人能够劝谏国王
I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.

我并没有列席御前议会 没有么？
I didn't sit on the small council. No?

御林护卫的长官不是通常都要出席的么
Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally

照理来说 确实如此 但在劳勃起义的期间
Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen

我杀了他的许多朋友
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

他才不需要听取疯王护卫的谏言
He didn't want advice on how to govern

来帮他治国安邦呢
from a man who had fought for the Mad King.

我倒是松了口气
Can't say I minded much.

我向来憎恶政治
I always hated the politics.

是啊 我又何尝不是呢
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

花那么多的时间去谋算如何背后放冷箭
Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings

或是背信弃义 嗯
and betrayals the world over. Mmhmm.

但若是她若想一统七国
Still, she'll have to wade through that muck

就必须从这些污秽的政争中杀出一条血路
if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

她会需要良臣名将的辅佐和谏言
She'll have good men around her to advise her,

真正的有识之士
men with experience.

说到这类人 你会想到谁呢？
Which men do you have in mind?

乔拉爵士 我下面要说的话还望您见谅
Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say,

但您的声誉在维斯特洛多年以来可以说是受尽诟病了
but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.

都是因为一个原因
It suffered for a reason.

我曾经贩卖过奴隶
I sold men into slavery.

我不确定如果您继续留在她的身边
I don't know if your presence by her side

能否对我们复辟故土的大业有任何助益
will help our cause when we go home.

大业？
Our cause?

恕我直言 巴里斯坦爵士
Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy

但在您向劳勃国王点头哈腰的时候
defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins

我可是在忙着为卡莉熙抵御他派来的刺客哩
while you were still bowing to the man.

我俩都希望她能复国称帝啊 难道不是么？
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

您可是仅仅加入我们阵营几日而已啊
You only joined us a few days ago.

我不敢妄言你的动机为何
I can't speak to your intentions.

但如果我们诚心要做女王殿下忠实的仆人
If we're truly her loyal servants,

任何需要去做的事情 我们都要完成它
we will do whatever needs to be done,

无论代价 不计荣辱
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

在这里你也并不是什么御林铁卫队长了
You're not Lord Commander here.

你也只是另一个流亡者而已
You're just another exile.

而我只听从女王的号令
And I take my orders from the queen.

上床休息吧 你说对了
Come to bed. You were right.

卡史塔克弃我而去了
The Karstarks are gone.

带走我们将近一半的兵力
Almost half our forces.

泰温兰尼斯特知道如何逐步瓦解我们的势力
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.

他无需做什么
Nothing.

只要静静的等待
Only wait.

别让他得逞
Don't let him.

我能做些什么呢？
What can I do?

攻打君临城?
Attack King's Landing?

那就正遂了他的心意
There's nothing he'd like better.

他一天之内即可粉碎我们
He'd crush us in a day.

我们可以拥兵北上
We could ride north.

把葛雷乔伊侵略的疆土夺回来
Take your land back from the Greyjoys.

等待冬天结束再卷土重来 冬季可能会持续五年之久啊
Wait out the winter. Winter could last five years.

一旦我的封臣回到家中
Once my bannermen are home again,

坐在火炉边 被家人陪伴着
sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families,

温暖且安全 就没人再动南下之念了
warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.

当我将众臣集结一处时
When I gathered my lords together,

我们曾有着共同的目标和任务
we had a purpose, a mission.

如今我们就像一群不停在争吵的小孩
Now we're like a band of bickering children.

那就给他们一个新目标
Give them a new purpose.

什么呢？
What?

哎 我也不知道啊
Oh, I don't know.

我甚至连临冬城在哪都不知道
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

在这里
Here.

而我们在这儿 那是君临城… 
And we're here. King's Landing

你怎么了？
What is it?

我无法逼迫他们和我军兵戎相见
I can't force them to meet us in the field

我也不能和敌军的精锐开战
and I can't attack them where they're strongest,

但我可以攻其不备
but I can attack them where they're not.

凯岩城是不会插翅而飞的
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

我将会把他们的家园从他们的手中夺走
I'm going to take their home away from them.

你能做到么？
Can you do it?

我需要有人手来取代折回家乡的卡史塔克军队
I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.

放眼全境 只有一人
There is only one person in this kingdom

拥有这样的兵力 而且尚未与兰尼斯特家族结盟
with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.

我本应该称之为岳父的那个人
The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry

瓦德佛雷
Walder Frey.

他真是个优秀的武士
He's such a splendid fighter.

珊莎・史塔克


你有什么好建议可以让我们… 
Do you have any idea when we might...

待我和乔佛里成亲之日 我便着手开始谋划
I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

玛格丽・提利尔
乔佛里国王的未婚妻

事情很快便会遂我们心愿
It should grow quickly.

乔佛里不会让我离开的
Joffrey won't let me leave.

他有一堆留下我的理由
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

而他又只需一个由头就会放你走
And only one to let you go.

因为这么做会取悦于我
Because it will please me.

侍从！
Squire!

打得好 大人
Well fought, ser.

洛拉斯的侍从

又不是来真的. 我没见过你
That was no fight. I don't know you.

洛拉斯・提利尔
“百花骑士” 御林铁卫

在下奥利佛
Olyver, if it please you.

我觉得你应当和一个实力相当的伙伴较量 大人
I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

你怎么看出来的？
How did you know?

看出来什么？
Know what?

看出我也想要啊
That I wanted to.

大人啊… 
My lord...

你要知道我就要成婚了
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon

可我连什么时候被订婚都一无所知
and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.

这种事总是私下决定的 在我看来
They rarely do, in my experience.

你的经验蛮丰富的啊 是吧？
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

与丈夫们偷情 是的
With the husbands.

你上手挺快啊
That didn't take long.

额 也够久的了
Well, it took long enough.

看起来我们的百花骑士已经订了婚了
It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

是么？
Is he?

那… 
And...

谁是那个幸运的女孩儿啊？
who's the lucky girl?

这也许不是世界上最宏伟
She may not be the grandest ship in the world

最快的船
or the fastest,

但它属于我
but she's mine.

我一直想要一艘船
I've always wanted a ship.

现在我想要一个舰队
Now I want a dozen.

好奇怪啊 不是么？ 你是说？
Strange, isn't it? What is?

有时一旦我们得到拥有了
It doesn't matter what we want,

我们曾经的所想就变得那么无足轻重
once we get it,

那时的我们又渴望新的事物
then we want something else.

你的发型很与众不同呢
Your hair is different.

是么？
Is it?

玛格丽小姐就是这样的发型
Lady Margaery wears it that way.

很多小姐都这么弄
Many ladies wear it this way.

我有个好消息
I have good news.

不久我就会离开这座城市了
I'll be leaving the city soon.

你仍然想要我和你一起去？
You still want me to come with you?

这并不在于我想如何
It's not a question of what I want.

而是你想要怎样
It's what you want.

你想回家 不是么？
You want to go home, don't you?

那是当然 比一切都想
Of course. More than anything.

但也许更应该等待
But maybe it would be better to wait.

我在想着这将会变得多么的危险
I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.

不是说我 而是对你
Not just for me, but for you.

您那么的仁慈
You've been so kind.

若有不幸的事发生在你身上 我会很伤心
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.

听你这么挂念我的安危
I can't tell you how touched I am

我真的无法形容我有多感动
by your concern for my welfare.

希望你把我当做你的朋友 珊莎

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

在和奥莲娜提利尔会谈之后
that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,

这一场通婚
I've saved the crown

我为皇室省去了成千上万的开销
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

现在不用担心这个了
Never mind that now.

我们还有要事要商量
We have something important to discuss.

我乃财政大臣 节省开支是重中之重
I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.

别那么看我
Stop that.

你看得我很不舒服
You're making me uncomfortable.

你姐姐得到情报你的新朋友提利尔家族
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells

正谋划将珊莎史塔克嫁给洛拉斯爵士
are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

很好啊
Very well.

她是个可爱的女孩子
She's a lovely girl.

虽然不见得真的对洛拉斯的胃口
Missing some of Loras' favorite bits,

但我相信他们能和得来
but I'm sure they'll make do.

你的笑话很无聊  这不是我最好的发挥啦 但是… 
Your jokes are not appreciated. It wasn't my best, but

我把这些人带入皇室 他们就这么报答我
I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me,

想从我手中窃取通往北境的钥匙
by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.

珊莎是通往北境的钥匙？
Sansa is the key to the North?

我好像记得她还有个大哥嘛
I seem to remember she has an older brother.

卡史塔克家族已经返回故乡了
The Karstarks have marched home.

狼崽丧失了近乎一半的军力  他已经气数将尽
The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered.

葛雷乔依把他的两个小弟都杀了
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

这样一来 珊莎史塔克就成了临冬城的继承人
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.

但我可无意任由她和提利尔家族联姻
And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.

正是提利尔家族的相助 我们才赢得了战争
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.

你这样拒绝他们明智么
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

倒不是说拒绝 这里面有一个计策
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

计策可不是人人都知道的呢
Plots are not public knowledge.

在小乔大婚之前
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out

提利尔家族这个心思不会得逞的
until after Joffrey's wedding.

我们必须先下手为强 把这个联盟扼杀在摇篮中
We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.

是吧 咱们怎么去做呢？
And how do we do that?

我们给珊莎史塔克指定另一门婚配
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

好主意  是好主意
Wonderful. Yes, it is.

你不是认真的吧
You can't mean it.

真的啊 这还有假
I can and I do.

小乔杀了这孩子的父亲
Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable

让她的日子过的也生不如死
since the day he took her father's head.

现在她好不容易挣脱小乔的魔掌 你把她交给我？
Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me?

即便是你 这么做也太过残忍
That's cruel even for you.

你想要虐待她么？
Do you intend on mistreating her?

她幸不幸福 与我何干
The girl's happiness is not my concern,

又与你何干 她还只是个孩子！
nor should it be yours. She's a child!

她已经来过潮了 我向你保证 我们曾就此详细的讨论过
She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.

就这么定了 你要娶她 睡了她 而且要让她怀上你的种
There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.

当然这些都是你能做到的  如果我拒绝呢？
Surely you're capable of that. And if I refuse?

你不是一直想因为你在战争的战绩而受到赏赐么
You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle.

珊莎史塔克这样的赏赐 你做梦也不敢去梦吧
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.

而且你也到了该成婚的时候了
And it is past time you were wed.

我曾经结过婚
I was wed.

你忘了么？
Or don't you remember?

记得可清楚了
Only too well.

你还是感谢天感谢地去吧
You should be thanking the gods for this.

你何德何能受到如此丰厚的奖赏哦
This is more than you deserve.

提利昂将依命行事
Tyrion will do as he's bid.

你也一样
As will you.

你什么意思？
What do you mean?

你将和洛拉斯联姻
You'll marry Ser Loras.

我才不呢  那个男孩是高庭家族的继承人
I will not. The boy is heir to Highgarden.

提利昂将确保北境的稳固 你要确保边境的长治久安
Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.

不 我不会这么做 你必须这么做
No, I won't do it. Yes, you will.

你还能生养 你必须再嫁而且要繁育后代
You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.

我是摄政太后 不是种马
I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.

你是我女儿！
You're my daughter!

你就要听从我的号令
You will do as I command

你必须要和洛拉斯提利尔联姻
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

并以此一劳永逸的
and put an end to the disgusting rumors

终结关于你的流言
about you once and for all.

父亲 我求你不要让我这么去做啊
Father, don't make me do it again, please.

不要再多说什么了
Not another word.

孩子们
My children.

你们已经让兰尼斯特这个名字受辱太久了
You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
