嗯嗯 我听说人们叫他小恶魔
Mmm, I hear they call him the Imp.

我却听说他讨厌这个外号
I hear he hates that nickname.

是嘛？ 我觉得这个外号倒是名副其实
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

他真是个贪杯的小色鬼 精通各种风流姿势哟
I hear he's a drunken little lecher, prone to all manner of perversions.

需要我跟你解释虚掩房门在妓院里的意义吗 老哥?
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother? 

毫无疑问 这方面知识你比我丰富, 我来是因为咱们的好姐姐想念你了
You have much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention.

她总是那么爱激动
She has odd cravings, our sister.

傍晚史塔克家要设宴为我们接风
Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

别扔下我独自应付
Don't leave me alone with these people.

不好意思 恐怕我已经提前入席了
I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

我就知道你会这么说
I thought you might say that.

傍晚见
See you at sundown.

真有必要把她葬在这种地方？
Did you have to bury her in a place like this?

她应该安葬在风景优美的山丘上 头顶有阳光白云与她为伴
She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.

她属于这里
This is where she belongs.

每晚在梦中 我都要杀他一次
In my dreams, I kill him every night.

坦格利安家族灭亡了
The Targaryens are gone.

我们的准新娘在这儿呢
There's our bridetobe.

瞧 这是伊利里欧送的礼物
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

没关系 瞧瞧这料子
Go on, feel the fabric.

他是不是很慷慨啊？
Isn't he a gracious host?

我们在他府上住了一年多了 他还没要求过任何回报
We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.

伊利里欧可不笨
Illyrio's no fool.

他知道有朝一日当我重登王位 不会忘记雪中送炭的朋友
He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne.

得让他们知道 你已经有女人的形态了
Let them see.  You have a woman's body now.

今天我需要你打起十二分精神
I need you to be perfect today.

能做到吗？
Can you do that for me?

我的好妹妹 将来史家为我立传时 会说我的统治始自今夜
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.

水烫着呢 公主殿下！
It's too hot, my lady.

多斯拉克人可没有守时的概念
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.

请允许我介绍府上嘉宾
May I present my honored guests?

安达尔人及先民真正的国王 坦格利安家族的 韦赛里斯三世
Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

你看到他的头发有多长了没？
Do you see how long his hair is?

每当多斯拉克人在战斗中落败 他们便割去辫子 让全世界知道他们的耻辱
When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids so the whole world can see their shame.

卓戈卡奥一辈子都没吃过败仗
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

当然 他不过是个蛮子 却也是世上最厉害的蛮子
He's a savage, of course, but one of the finest killers alive.

请上前来 公主
Come forward, my dear.

见面仪式已经结束 可他还什么都没说呢！
The ceremony is over. But he didn't say anything.

您将率军渡过狭海 夺回您父王的王位
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea, and take back your father's throne.

全国上下的子民正偷偷举杯 向您致敬
The people drink secret toasts to your health.

他们会为真正的国王起而奋战
They cry out for their true king.

究竟何时完婚？
When will they be married?

很快 多斯拉克人不是拖泥带水的民族
Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.

他们真的连马都搞吗？
Is it true they lie with their horses?

你当我是笨蛋？
Do you take me for a fool?

我当您是王者
I take you for a king.

所谓王者无凡虑
Kings lack the caution of common men.

倘若我冒犯了您 我道歉
My apologies if I've given offense.

我很清楚怎么跟卓戈这号人打交道
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

我送他一个王后 他还我一支军队
I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

我不想当他的王后
I don't want to be his queen.

我想带咱俩一起回家 但我们的家早给人夺走了
I want us both to go home, but they took it from us.

你倒是说说看 好妹妹 我们怎么回家啊？
So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?

我们会带着军队 带着卓戈卡奥的千军万马杀回去
We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army.

只要能得到这支军队 就算得让整个卡拉萨 四万野蛮人 连同他们的马通通把你操上一遍… 我也会同意
I would let his whole tribe fuck you... All 40,000 men and their horses too if that's what it took.

那他就是有史以来最蠢的王子了
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

他真的好帅哦
He's so handsome.

我们什么时候结婚啊？现在吗？还是得再等等？
When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?

别激动！婚事你父亲大人还没点头呢
Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.

他为什么不同意嘛？
Why would he say no?

他很快就要成为一人之下 万人之上的首相了
He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.

你当初不也是离家来这儿的吗？
You left your home to come here.

而我有朝一日将成为王后
And I'd be queen someday.

求你了 让父亲答应下来吧!
Please make father say yes!

这是我一辈子最大的心愿
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

它死透了没有?
Is he dead yet?

我整日骑马赶回来 就是不忍心让你们独自应付兰尼斯特
Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.

你不去里面参加晚宴吗？
Why aren't you at the feast?

史塔克夫人认为若让私生子与王族同桌 对他们是种侮辱
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

好吧 长城上可没这些拘束
Well, you're always welcome on the wall.

私生子随时都有座
No bastard was ever refused a seat there.

你回去的时候带我一起走吧！
So take me with you when you go back.

长城又不会搬家 你不必…
The wall isn't going anywhere.

我该进去了 好给你父亲解围
I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests.

你叔叔可是守夜人？
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

你在这儿做什么？
What are you doing back there?

酝酿怎么跟你家人共度良宵呗
Preparing for a night with your family.

那你呢…你是奈德·史塔克的私生子 对吧？
And you... you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

我冒犯到你了吗?抱歉
Did I offend you? Sorry.

你确实是个私生子
You are the bastard though.

私生子小弟 让我给你一点建议罢
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

用它来武装自己 就没有人可以用它来伤害你
Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.

你又知道身为私生子是什么样子？
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

全天下的侏儒在他们父亲眼里都跟私生子没两样
All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.

你在宴会上 就像头困在笼子的熊
You at a feast... It's like a bear in a trap.

你认识他吗? 我当然认识
Did you know him? Of course I did.

说什么异鬼杀了他的伙伴
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

跟他同行的两名守夜人的确失踪了
The two he was with are still missing.

哼 多半是中了野人的埋伏
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

或许吧
Maybe.

冰原狼在长城以南现身
Direwolves south of the wall,

异鬼出没的谣言
talk of the walkers,

现在我哥哥也要去做首相了
and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.

真是“凛冬将至”啊
Winter is coming.

凛冬将至…
Winter is coming.

班杨叔叔 罗柏侄儿
Uncle Benjen. Robb boy.

你都好吗? 我很好啊
How are you? I'm good.

这是您第一次来北方吗 陛下？
Is this your first time in the north, Your Grace?

是的 美丽的国度
Yes. Lovely country.

我敢说 跟君临相比 这儿一定严酷得紧
I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.

我还记得奈德第一次带我来这儿的时候
I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me

我有多么恐惧
up here for the first time.

你好 小白鸽
Hello, little dove.

你真美啊
But you are a beauty.

多大了？ 十三岁 陛下
How old are you? 13, Your Grace.

挺高的啊 还在长个吗？
You're tall. Still growing?

我想是吧 陛下
I think so, Your Grace.

那你有过月事了吗?
And have you bled yet?

还没有…陛下
No, Your Grace.

你的裙服 是你自己绣的？
Your dress, did you make it?

真是心灵手巧 日后也为我绣点什么吧
Such a talent. You must make something for me.

风传咱们两家要抱孙子了
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

我也听说了
I hear the same.

你的女儿定会成为宫中的明珠
Your daughter will do well in the Capital.

这朵鲜花不应该埋没在这里
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.

让一让 听说咱们要做邻居了
Your pardon. I hear we might be neighbors soon.

但愿如此 不错
I hope it's true. Yes,

国王陛下有意赐予我一份莫大的荣誉
the king has honored me with his offer.

何不顺水推舟呢…我们才好继续举办比武会
I'm sure we'll have a tournament

以庆祝您走马上任
to celebrate your new title... if you accept.

跟您下场子切磋会很有趣
It would be good to have you on the field.

都是些老对手太无聊了
The competition has become a bit stale.

我不参加比武会 为什么？
I don't fight in tournaments. No?

年纪大了怕不方便吗?
Getting a little old for it?

我不参加比武会
I don't fight in tournaments

是因为跟人真刀真枪干上的时候
because when I fight a man for real

我不想让对手知道我的本事
I don't want him to know what I can do.

说得好
Well said.

艾莉亚!
Arya!

这一点也不好玩!
It's not funny!

她老是捣蛋
She always does this.

这是我最喜欢的裙子
This was my favorite dress.

她老是捣蛋 这一点也不好玩!
She always does it and it's not funny!

该睡觉了
Time for bed.

我是个北方人
I'm a Northman.

我属于这里 属于你 我无意南下
I belong here with you, not down south

去那个被称之为“都城”的老鼠窝
in that rats' nest they call a Capital.

我不会让他带走你的
I won't let him take you.

王命难违啊
The king takes what he wants.

谁能说个“不”字呢？
That's why he's king.

我会说 “听好了 死胖子”
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

“不许你带走我老公”
"You are not taking my husband anywhere.

“他是要跟我厮守到老的”
He belongs to me now."

他怎能长那么胖?
How did he get so fat?

不是吃就是喝 就成那样了呗
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.

鲁温师傅求见 陛下
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

让他进来

请原谅 陛下 夫人

是您妹妹派来的

她说琼恩·艾林乃是被人谋害

被兰尼斯特家
By the Lannisters.

她还说国王的处境凶险万分
She says the king is in danger.

你妹妹刚做了寡妇 凯特

她根本不知道自己在说些什么
She doesn't know what she's saying.

此信若是落入他人手里
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now

莱莎就得掉脑袋
if the wrong people had found that letter.

若她没有十足把握
Do you think she would risk her life...

会甘冒这么大风险？
her son's life...

赌上自己和儿子的性命吗？
if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?

如果此事属实
If this news is true

如果兰尼斯特家族觊觎王位
and the Lannisters conspire against the Throne,

除了您 又有谁能保护国王呢？
who but you can protect the king?

他们下毒手谋害了前任首相
They murdered the last hand.

你居然让奈德再去作牺牲品？
Now you want Ned to take the job?

国王马不停蹄地赶了一个月
The king rode for a month

就是来向陛下求援的
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

陛下是他唯一信任的人
He's the only one he trusts.

而您也曾誓言效忠您的国王
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

他为了劳勃戎马半生 问心无愧
He's spent half his life fighting Robert's wars.

他不欠劳勃什么情

卓戈卡奥既已答应给您一顶王冠
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,

您就一定能得到 何时?
you shall have it. When?

当预兆显示战争吉利的时候
When their omens favor war.

我管他妈的多斯拉克预兆
I piss on Dothraki omens.

为夺回王位 我已经苦等了十七年
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

力量的试炼！
Test your might!

一场多斯拉克婚礼

Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say

“谢谢”该怎么说？

There is no word for thank you in Dothraki.

好好取悦他

可不是嘛？
If I get through this without squirting

我没吐别人一身已经是奇迹了
