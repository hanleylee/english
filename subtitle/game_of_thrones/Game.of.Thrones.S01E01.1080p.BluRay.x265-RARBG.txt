轻点声 伙计
Easy, boy.

威尔
守夜人游骑兵

不开化的蛮子 行事当然野蛮了
What do you expect? They're savages.

这伙野人顺手牵了那伙野人的羊
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

吃亏的不服气 回来杀个片甲不留呗
before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.

这不像野人的行径
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

这种事情我根本没见过
I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.

你靠近观察过吗？
How close did you get?

靠得不能更近了！ 咱们返回长城吧
Close as any man would. We should head back to the wall.

威玛·罗伊斯
守夜人游骑兵

死人吓着你了么？
Do the dead frighten you?

我们受命追查野人行踪
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

盖瑞
守夜人游骑兵

我们照办了 现在他们再也不会来骚扰我们
We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.

你觉得上头不会追问他们的死因吗？
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

牵马上路
Get back on your horse.

不管是什么东西干的 它连孩子都不放过！
Whatever did it to them could do it to us.

很可能也会袭击我们！
They even killed the children.

幸好我们不是孩子
It's a good thing we're not children.

你吓破了胆 尽可以逃回南边啊
You want to run away south, run away.

只不过 即便你能逃出我的手掌心
Of course they will behead you as a deserter,

也会被当成逃兵斩首
if I don't catch you first.

快去牵马
Get back on your horse.

给你最后一次机会
I won't say it again.

看起来 死人转移阵地啰
Your dead men seem to have moved camp.

他们就在这里的
They were here.

四处找找看
See where they went.

那是什么？
What is it?

是…
It's...

I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners.

艾莉亚·史塔克
临冬城公爵次女

好一双巧手
Quite beautiful.

瞧这针脚…
The stitching...

你们哪个是十岁时就百发百中的？
And which one of you was a marksman at 10?

艾德·史塔克
临冬城公爵 昵称“奈德”

接着练 布兰
Keep practicing, Bran.

别灰心
Go on.

琼恩·雪诺

席恩·葛雷乔伊
临冬城公爵养子

非得这样做吗？
Do you have to?

他背弃了誓言 凯特
He swore an oath, Cat.

按律当斩 夫人
The law is law, my lady.

这次把布兰也带上
Tell Bran he's coming too.

奈德！
Ned.

十岁的孩子恐怕不合适…
10 is too young to see such things.

他不可能永远是个孩子
He won't be a boy forever.

更何况凛冬将至
And winter is coming.

瑞肯·史塔克
临冬城公爵幼子

小子 去后面把剩下的箭取回来
Lad, go run back and get the rest.

异鬼…
White walkers.

我看见异鬼了…
I saw the white walkers.

鬼…
White walkers.

异鬼…我看见它们了…
The white walkers, I saw them.

我知道自己背弃了誓言
I know I broke my oath.

我是个逃兵
And I know I'm a deserter.

我应该回长城去报警 只是…
I should have gone back to the wall and warned them, but...

我真的看见了
I saw what I saw.

我看见了异鬼
I saw the white walkers.

您必须警告他们
People need to know.

再给我家里捎句话…
If you can get word to my family...

告诉他们我不是懦夫
Tell them I'm no coward.

告诉他们我很抱歉
Tell them I'm sorry.

宽恕我 天父
Forgive me, lord.

以安达尔人和“先民”的国王
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,

七国统治者… 别转开头
the first of his name... Don't look away.

…暨全境守护者… 父亲会知道的
...King of the Andals and the First Men... Father will know if you do.

…拜拉席恩家族的劳勃一世之名

我 史塔克家族的艾德
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

临冬城公爵与北境守护
Lord of Winterfell and warden of the north,

在此宣判你死刑
sentence you to die.

你做得很好
You did well.

你知道我为什么要杀他？
You understand why I did it?

琼恩说他是个逃兵
Jon said he was a deserter.

那我为何要亲自行刑？
But do you understand why I had to kill him?

“我们家族遵循古老的传统”？
"Our way is the old way"?

判决死刑的人
The man who passes the sentence

必须亲自动手
should swing the sword.

他真的看见异鬼了吗？
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

异鬼早已经消失了几千年
The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.

所以他是骗人的？
So he was lying?

疯子总是把幻想当真
A madman sees what he sees.

这是怎么回事？
What is it?

山狮干的？
Mountain lion?

附近森林里没有山狮
There are no mountain lions in these woods.

一头怪物!
It's a freak!

这是冰原狼
It's a direwolf.

好顽强的野兽
Tough old beast.

绝境长城以南没有冰原狼
There are no direwolves south of the wall.

眼前不就有五只
Now there are five.

想抱抱吗？
You want to hold it?

他们以后怎么办呢？
Where will they go?

他们的妈妈死了
Their mother's dead.

他们不属于这个地方
They don't belong down here.

不如趁早了结
Better a quick death.

没有母狼他们活不长
They won't last without their mother.

好 把那东西递过来 不要！
Right. Give it here. No!

把匕首拿开
Put away your blade.

你父亲才有资格下令 你没有
I take orders from your father, not you.

求你了 爸爸！ 抱歉 布兰
Please, father! I'm sorry, Bran.

史塔克大人？
Lord Stark?

总共有五只小狼…
There are five pups...

而您恰好有五个孩子
One for each of the Stark children.

冰原狼又是史塔克家族的纹章
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

他们是注定要拥有这些小狼的
They were meant to have them.

你们得亲自训练他们
You will train them yourselves.

亲自喂养他们
You will feed them yourselves.

如果他们夭折 你们还得亲手埋葬他们
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

你不要小狼吗？
What about you?

我并非史塔克
I'm not a Stark.

走吧
Get on.

那是什么？
What is it?

狼群的弃儿 非你莫属嘛 雪诺
The runt of the litter... That one's yours, Snow.

君  临

作弟弟的有责任提醒你
As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you:

你多虑了
you worry too much.

别愁眉苦脸的 你向来是这样满不在乎
It's starting to show. And you never worry about anything.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
王后

记得咱们七岁那年 在凯岩城
When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

詹姆·兰尼斯特
御林铁卫 王后的孪生弟弟

你就敢从百尺高的悬崖往水里跳
100foot drop into the water,

一点都不害怕
and you were never afraid.

在你告诉父亲之前 本来没什么好怕的
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father.

“我们是兰尼斯特家的人”
"We're Lannisters.

“兰尼斯特决不当耍把戏的傻子”
Lannisters don't act like fools."

你怎么知道琼恩·艾林没说出去？
What if Jon Arryn told someone?

他能说给谁听？
But who would he tell?

我丈夫 倘若他告诉了国王
My husband. If he told the king, both our heads

你我的人头早已高挂城头
would be skewered on the city gates by now.

不管琼恩·艾林打听到些什么 那些都被他带进了坟墓
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him.

劳勃会找位新首相…找个人替他当差
And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King... someone to do his job

他才好继续干野猪 猎妓女…
while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores...

咦 我说反了吗?
Or is it the other way around?

反正就是一切照旧呗
And life will go on.

当首相的该是你才对
You should be the Hand of the King.

饶了我吧
That's an honor I can do without.

这首相作得辛苦
Their days are too long,

命却不长
their lives are too short.

这么多年了
All these years

每当来到这里
and I still feel like an outsider

我仍然感觉自己像个外人
when I come here.

你养育了五个北方的孩子
You have five northern children.

怎可能还是外人？
You're not an outsider.

远古旧神可未必同意
I wonder if the old gods agree.

你的七神才有那许多规矩呢
It's your gods with all the rules.

我很难过 亲爱的
I am so sorry, my love.

什么事？ 有只乌鸦从君临送信来
Tell me. There was a raven from King's Landing.

琼恩·艾林过世了
Jon Arryn is dead.

热病带走了他
A fever took him.

我知道他对你有如生父再世
I know he was like a father to you.

你妹妹和她的孩子呢？ 他们平安无恙
Your sister, the boy? They both have their health,

诸神慈悲
gods be good.

信上还说到别的事…
The raven brought more news...

国王正在前往临冬城的路上
The king rides for Winterfell...

他带着王后
With the queen

和大半朝臣
and all the rest of them.

他千里迢迢深入北境
If he's coming this far north...

只可能有一个原因…
There's only one thing he's after.

你可以拒绝他的 奈德
You can always say no, Ned.

提利昂大人的卧室里要多放些蜡烛
We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

据说他会通宵读书
I'm told he reads all night.

我却听说他会通宵酗酒
I'm told he drinks all night.

能喝多少呢？他那样的…
How much could he possibly drink? A man of his...

身量
Stature?

我们从窖里提了八桶麦酒上来
We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.

等着瞧吧 无论怎样
Perhaps we'll find out. In any case,

蜡烛不能少
candles.

你母亲干嘛非要我们打扮给国王看？
Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king?

是为了王后吧 我听说她是个臭美的矫情女人
It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

我倒听说王子是个风骚的小色狼
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

想想所有被这头小色狼…
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab

上过的南方女孩
with his right royal prick.

来吧 汤姆 给他剪漂亮点
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

他爱这鸡窝头胜过爱姑娘
He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.

诸神在上 他们长得真快
Gods, but they grow fast.

布兰登!
Brandon!

我看见国王了 他的队伍有几百号人呢
I saw the king. He's got hundreds of people.

我说过多少次不许乱爬？
How many times have I told you no climbing?

但国王马上就要到了…就在大道上呢
But he's coming right now... down our road.

我要你跟我保证
I want you to promise me,

决不再爬墙了
no more climbing.

我保证
I promise.

你知道吗？ 知道什么？
Do you know what? What?

你撒谎之前总是会盯着脚看
You always look at your feet before you lie.

快跑去找你父亲 说国王马上就到
Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.

艾莉亚上哪儿去了？珊莎 你妹妹呢？
Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?

你戴着这玩意儿做什么？
What are you doing with that on?

算了算了
Go on.

让开！
Move!

珊莎·史塔克
临冬城公爵长女

乔佛里·拜拉席恩
大王子

劳勃·拜拉席恩
国王

陛下
Your Grace.

你小子发福了
You've got fat.

凯特！ 陛下
Cat! Your Grace.

九年了…怎就见不着你呢？你死到哪里去了？
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?

替您守护北境啊 陛下
Guarding the north for you, Your Grace.

临冬城听候您差遣
Winterfell is yours.

小恶魔在哪儿呢？ 你闭嘴行吗？
Where's the Imp? Will you shut up?

这些都是谁啊？
Who have we here?

你肯定是罗柏
You must be Robb.

啊 美人胚子
My, you're a pretty one.

你叫什么名字？
Your name is?

艾莉亚
Arya.

给咱们展示一下你的肌肉
Oh, show us your muscles.

你会是个好战士
You'll be a soldier.

那就是詹姆·兰尼斯特啦 王后的孪生弟弟
That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother.

拜托 你闭嘴行吗？
Would you please shut up?

王后陛下
My queen.

王后陛下
My queen.

带我到你们家墓窖去 我要聊表敬意
Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.

亲爱的 我们奔波了一个月
We've been riding for a month, my love.

要看死人也不用这么着急
Surely the dead can wait.

奈德
Ned.

小恶魔究竟在哪儿呢?
Where's the Imp?

我们的弟弟哪儿去了?
Where is our brother?

把这小畜生给我找回来
Go and find the little beast.

跟我说说琼恩·艾林的事
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

前阵子他还好端端的 然后…
One minute he was fine and then...

那病活活把他给燃尽了
Burned right through him, whatever it was.

我好敬爱他啊
I loved that man.

我们都一样
We both did.

他可没为你伤脑筋 对我就不同了
He never had to teach you much, but me?

还记得我十来岁那会儿吗？
You remember me at 16?

成天盘算着怎么拿锤子砸人
All I wanted to do

怎么多搞几个女孩诸如此类
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

是他教诲我为人之道 是吧
He showed me what was what. Aye.

别这样看着我 我不受教又不是他的错
Don't look at me like that. It's not his fault I didn't listen.

我需要你帮忙 奈德
I need you, Ned...

跟我南下君临 不要一个人躲在这世界尽头 毫无用武之地
down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody.

艾德·史塔克大人
Lord Eddard Stark,

我将任命你为国王之手
I would name you the Hand of the King.

恐怕我不足以胜任此等要职
I'm not worthy of the honor.

我才不要为你着想 我是打算让你来治理国家
I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

而我呢？痛痛快快地吃喝玩乐 嫖个过瘾
while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.

妈的 奈德 快站起来
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

你既然帮我得到了这张该死的铁椅子
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

就该帮我保住它吧
now help me keep the damn thing.

我们注定是要并肩治理国家的
We were meant to rule together.

倘若你妹妹还活着 我们就该是联姻手足了
If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood.

好在现在也不迟
Well, it's not too late.

我有个儿子 你有个女儿
I have a son, you have a daughter.

他们会把两家结合在一起
We'll join our houses.

提利昂·兰尼斯特
王后幼弟 "小恶魔"

北方女孩果然有一套
It is true what they say about the northern girls.

你知道国王来临冬城了吗
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

略有耳闻
I did hear something about that.

同行的还有王后和她的弟弟
And the queen and her twin brother.

罗丝
妓女

大家都说他是七国上下最帅的男人
They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

那另一个弟弟呢？
And the other brother?

王后有两个弟弟吗？ 一个脸蛋俊
The queen has two brothers? There's the pretty one,

一个脑子灵
and there's the clever one.

嗯嗯 我听说人们叫他小恶魔
Mmm, I hear they call him the Imp.

我却听说他讨厌这个外号
I hear he hates that nickname.

是嘛？ 我觉得这个外号倒是名副其实
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

他真是个贪杯的小色鬼
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

精通各种风流姿势哟
prone to all manner of perversions.

真聪明
Clever girl.

我们等您等的好辛苦啊 提利昂大人！
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

是吗?
Have you?

噢! 又硬了?
Oh! Already?

诸神好歹恩赐我一样好东西
The gods gave me one blessing.

继续干你们的 大人
Don't get up. My lord.

需要我跟你解释虚掩房门在妓院里的意义吗
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door

老哥? 毫无疑问 这方面知识你比我丰富
in a whorehouse, brother? You have much to teach me, no doubt,

我来是因为咱们的好姐姐想念你了
but our sister craves your attention.

她总是那么爱激动
She has odd cravings, our sister.

家族遗传吧
A family trait.

傍晚史塔克家要设宴为我们接风
Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

别扔下我独自应付
Don't leave me alone with these people.

不好意思 恐怕我已经提前入席了
I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

这位娘子就是开胃菜
And this is the first of many courses.

我就知道你会这么说
I thought you might say that.

既然时间不等人…
But since we're short on time...

都进来吧 姑娘们
Come on, girls.

傍晚见
See you at sundown.

随手关门!
Close the door!

真有必要把她葬在这种地方？
Did you have to bury her in a place like this?

她应该安葬在风景优美的山丘上
She should be on a hill somewhere

头顶有阳光白云与她为伴
with the sun and the clouds above her.

她是我妹妹
She was my sister.

她属于这里
This is where she belongs.

她属于我
She belonged with me.

每晚在梦中 我都要杀他一次
In my dreams, I kill him every night.

您已经杀了他 陛下
It's done, Your Grace.

坦格利安家族灭亡了
The Targaryens are gone.

但我没能斩尽杀绝
Not all of them.

潘托斯

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安


丹妮！
Daenerys!

丹妮莉丝
Daenerys.

我们的准新娘在这儿呢
There's our bridetobe.

瞧 这是伊利里欧送的礼物
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

你摸摸
Touch it.

没关系 瞧瞧这料子
Go on, feel the fabric.

他是不是很慷慨啊？
Isn't he a gracious host?

我们在他府上住了一年多了
We've been his guests for over a year

他还没要求过任何回报
and he's never asked us for anything.

韦赛里斯·坦格利安
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的二哥

伊利里欧可不笨
Illyrio's no fool.

他知道有朝一日当我重登王位
He knows I won't forget my friends

不会忘记雪中送炭的朋友
when I come into my throne.

你还是弯腰驼背的
You still slouch.

得让他们知道
Let them see.

你已经有女人的形态了
You have a woman's body now.

今天我需要你打起十二分精神
I need you to be perfect today.

能做到吗？
Can you do that for me?

你不想唤醒睡龙之怒吧 想不想？
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

不想
No.

我的好妹妹 将来史家为我立传时
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister,

会说我的统治始自今夜
they will say it began today.

水烫着呢 公主殿下！
It's too hot, my lady.

伊利里欧·摩帕提斯
潘托斯总督

他人呢？
Where is he?

多斯拉克人可没有守时的概念
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.

恭迎尊贵伟大的卡奥
Respect to one that is respectful,great khal.

请允许我介绍府上嘉宾
May I present my honored guests?

安达尔人及先民真正的国王
Viserys of House Targaryen,

坦格利安家族的
the third of his name,

韦赛里斯三世
the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

他的妹妹
and his sister

坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

请允许我...
May I present...

你看到他的头发有多长了没？
Do you see how long his hair is?

每当多斯拉克人在战斗中落败
When Dothraki are defeated in combat,

他们便割去辫子 让全世界知道他们的耻辱
they cut off their braids so the whole world can see their shame.

卓戈卡奥一辈子都没吃过败仗
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

当然 他不过是个蛮子
He's a savage, of course,

却也是世上最厉害的蛮子
but one of the finest killers alive.

而你将会是他的王后
And you will be his queen.

请上前来 公主
Come forward, my dear.

卓戈 卡奥 
多斯拉克部族首领

他怎么跑了?
Where is he going?!

见面仪式已经结束 可他还什么都没说呢！
The ceremony is over. But he didn't say anything.

他喜欢她吗？ 相信我 陛下
Did he like her? Trust me, Your Grace,

假如看不上她 他早就发作了
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

用不了多久
It won't be long now.

您将率军渡过狭海
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea

夺回您父王的王位
and take back your father's throne.

全国上下的子民正偷偷举杯
The people drink secret toasts

向您致敬
to your health.

他们会为真正的国王起而奋战
They cry out for their true king.

究竟何时完婚？
When will they be married?

很快 多斯拉克人不是拖泥带水的民族
Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.

他们真的连马都搞吗？
Is it true they lie with their horses?

最好别在卓戈卡奥面前提这些
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

你当我是笨蛋？
Do you take me for a fool?

我当您是王者
I take you for a king.

所谓王者无凡虑
Kings lack the caution of common men.

倘若我冒犯了您 我道歉
My apologies if I've given offense.

我很清楚怎么跟卓戈这号人打交道
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

我送他一个王后 他还我一支军队
I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

我不想当他的王后
I don't want to be his queen.

我想回家
I want to go home.

我也想啊
So do I.

我想带咱俩一起回家
I want us both to go home,

但我们的家早给人夺走了
but they took it from us.

你倒是说说看 好妹妹
So tell me, sweet sister,

我们怎么回家啊？
how do we go home?

我不知道
I don't know.

我们会带着军队
We go home with an army.

带着卓戈卡奥的千军万马杀回去
With Khal Drogo's army.

只要能得到这支军队 就算得让整个卡拉萨
I would let his whole tribe fuck you...

四万野蛮人 连同他们的马通通把你操上一遍…
All 40,000 men and their horses too

我也会同意
if that's what it took.

你觉得乔佛里王子会看上我吗？
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

他嫌我丑怎么办？
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

那他就是有史以来最蠢的王子了
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

他真的好帅哦
He's so handsome.

我们什么时候结婚啊？现在吗？还是得再等等？
When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?

别激动！婚事你父亲大人还没点头呢
Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.

他为什么不同意嘛？
Why would he say no?

他很快就要成为一人之下 万人之上的首相了
He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.

但那样他就不得不离开家园
He'd have to leave home.

离开我
He'd have to leave me.

而你也得离家
And so would you.

你当初不也是离家来这儿的吗？
You left your home to come here.

而我有朝一日将成为王后
And I'd be queen someday.

求你了 让父亲答应下来吧!
Please make father say yes!

珊莎… 求你了求你了!
Sansa... Please please!

这是我一辈子最大的心愿
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

倒满!小子们 罗德利克 继续喝啊
Fill that up! Boys, Rodrik, come on.

干了!
Come on!

它死透了没有?
Is he dead yet?

班扬叔叔！
Uncle Benjen.

你长大了
You got bigger.

我整日骑马赶回来 就是不忍心让你们独自应付兰尼斯特
Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.

班扬·史塔克
临冬城公爵之弟 守夜人的首席游骑兵

你不去里面参加晚宴吗？
Why aren't you at the feast?

史塔克夫人认为若让私生子与王族同桌
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family

对他们是种侮辱
to seat a bastard in their midst.

好吧 长城上可没这些拘束
Well, you're always welcome on the wall.

私生子随时都有座
No bastard was ever refused a seat there.

你回去的时候带我一起走吧！
So take me with you when you go back.

琼恩… 只要你去说 父亲大人一定同意
Jon... Father will let me if you ask him.

我知道他一定会
I know he will.

长城又不会搬家 你不必…
The wall isn't going anywhere.

我已经做好准备
I'm ready

宣誓加入守夜人了
to swear your oath.

恐怕你无法想象将要付出的代价有多大
You don't understand what you'd be giving up.

我们没有家庭
We have no families.

永远也不会生儿育… 我才不在乎那个！
None of us will ever father sons... I don't care about that!

你若是知道这意味着什么 多半就会在乎了
You might, if you knew what it meant.

我该进去了
I'd better get inside,

好给你父亲解围
rescue your father from his guests.

咱们回头再聊
We'll talk later.

你叔叔可是守夜人？
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

你在这儿做什么？
What are you doing back there?

酝酿怎么跟你家人共度良宵呗
Preparing for a night with your family.

我一直想见识见识长城
I've always wanted to see the wall.

你是提利昂·兰尼斯特
You're Tyrion Lannister,

王后的弟弟？
the queen's brother?

这算是我最大的成就吧
My greatest accomplishment.

那你呢…你是奈德·史塔克的私生子 对吧？
And you... you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

我冒犯到你了吗?抱歉
Did I offend you? Sorry.

你确实是个私生子
You are the bastard though.

艾德·史塔克大人是我父亲
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

史塔克夫人却不是你母亲
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

这不就结了
making you the bastard.

私生子小弟 让我给你一点建议罢
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

永远不要忘记自己是什么人
Never forget what you are.

因为这个世界不会忘记
The rest of the world will not.

用它来武装自己
Wear it like armor

就没有人可以用它来伤害你
and it can never be used to hurt you.

你又知道身为私生子是什么样子？

全天下的侏儒在他们父亲眼里都跟私生子没两样
All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.

你在宴会上 就像头困在笼子的熊
You at a feast... It's like a bear in a trap.

但绝非孬种 奈德
And he was tough, Ned,

他是个真正的游骑兵

Pfft. He was talking madness.

说什么异鬼杀了他的伙伴
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

跟他同行的两名守夜人的确失踪了
The two he was with are still missing.

哼 多半是中了野人的埋伏
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

或许吧
Maybe.

冰原狼在长城以南现身
Direwolves south of the wall,

异鬼出没的谣言
talk of the walkers,

现在我哥哥也要去做首相了
and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.

真是“凛冬将至”啊

凛冬将至…
Winter is coming.

班杨叔叔 罗柏侄儿

你都好吗? 我很好啊
How are you? I'm good.

这是您第一次来北方吗 陛下？
Is this your first time in the north, Your Grace?

是的 美丽的国度

我敢说 跟君临相比 这儿一定严酷得紧
I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.

我还记得奈德第一次带我来这儿的时候
I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me

我有多么恐惧
up here for the first time.

你好 小白鸽
Hello, little dove.

你真美啊
But you are a beauty.

风传咱们两家要抱孙子了
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

我也听说了
I hear the same.

你的女儿定会成为宫中的明珠
Your daughter will do well in the Capital.

这朵鲜花不应该埋没在这里
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.

让一让 听说咱们要做邻居了
Your pardon. I hear we might be neighbors soon.

但愿如此 不错
I hope it's true. Yes,

国王陛下有意赐予我一份莫大的荣誉
the king has honored me with his offer.

何不顺水推舟呢…我们才好继续举办比武会
I'm sure we'll have a tournament

以庆祝您走马上任
to celebrate your new title... if you accept.

跟您下场子切磋会很有趣
It would be good to have you on the field.

都是些老对手太无聊了
The competition has become a bit stale.

我不参加比武会 为什么？
I don't fight in tournaments. No?

年纪大了怕不方便吗?
Getting a little old for it?

我不参加比武会
I don't fight in tournaments

是因为跟人真刀真枪干上的时候

说得好

我不会让他带走你的

王命难违啊
The king takes what he wants.

谁能说个“不”字呢？
That's why he's king.

我会说 “听好了 死胖子”
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

“不许你带走我老公”
"You are not taking my husband anywhere.

“他是要跟我厮守到老的”
He belongs to me now."

他怎能长那么胖?
How did he get so fat?

不是吃就是喝 就成那样了呗
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.

鲁温师傅求见 陛下
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

若她没有十足把握

会甘冒这么大风险？
her son's life...

赌上自己和儿子的性命吗？
if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?

如果此事属实
If this news is true

如果兰尼斯特家族觊觎王位
and the Lannisters conspire against the Throne,

除了您 又有谁能保护国王呢？
who but you can protect the king?

他们下毒手谋害了前任首相
They murdered the last hand.

你居然让奈德再去作牺牲品？
Now you want Ned to take the job?

国王马不停蹄地赶了一个月
The king rode for a month

就是来向陛下求援的
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

陛下是他唯一信任的人
He's the only one he trusts.

而您也曾誓言效忠您的国王
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

他为了劳勃戎马半生 问心无愧
