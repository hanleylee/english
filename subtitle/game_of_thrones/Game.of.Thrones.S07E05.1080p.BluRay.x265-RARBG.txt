第七季第五集  Eastwatch
东海望

黑水河的波隆
爵士

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者”

你差点搞死我
You could've killed me.

你他妈刚刚是在搞什么？
The fuck were you doing back there?

结束战争
Ending the war.

杀了她
Killing her.

你看到那条龙挡在她身前了吗
You saw the dragon between you and her?

所以呢
And?

听着 混蛋
Listen to me, cunt.

在我得到你欠我的东西之前
Till I get what I'm owed,

龙杀不了你
a dragon doesn't get to kill you,

你自己也杀不了你
you don't get to kill you,

只有我能杀了你
only I get to kill you.

这只是一条龙
That was only one of them.

她还有另外两条
She has two more.

如果她决定使用它们的力量 真正发挥它们的作用
If she decides to use them, to really use them...

那你就完蛋了 是我们都完蛋了
You're fucked. Don't you mean we're fucked?

不 我不会
No, I do not.

真有那么一天的话 我们的合作就到那为止了
Dragons are where our partnership ends.

那些东西朝着君临喷火的时候
I'm not gonna be around when those things

我绝对不会留在那里
start spitting fire on King's Landing.

我必须告诉瑟曦
I have to tell Cersei.

那你不如跳回河里去
May as well jump back in that river.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
女王之手

卓耿
女王的黑龙

我知道瑟曦是如何跟你们说的
I know what Cersei has told you.

她说我会摧毁你们的城市
That I've come to destroy your cities,

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生”  在龙石岛的女王

烧毁你们的家园
burn down your homes,

杀了你们 然后让你们的孩子成为孤儿
murder you, and orphan your children.

那是瑟曦・兰尼斯特的作风 不是我的
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

我来到这里不是为了杀人
I'm not here to murder,

而我唯一想要摧毁的是
and all I want to destroy

给了瑟曦・兰尼斯特这种人能为了一己之私
is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor

剥削一切富人穷人的社会制度
to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.

我给你们一个选择的机会… 
I offer you a choice

臣服于我 加入我的军队
bend the knee and join me.

我们将共同创造一个新世界 走向更美好的明天
Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it.

或者选择拒绝… 
Or refuse...

然后被处死
and die.

狄肯・塔利
蓝道・塔利的次子

蓝道・塔利
角陵伯爵

请上前来 大人
Step forward, my lord.

你不愿意臣服吗？
You will not kneel?

我已经宣誓效忠于一位女王了
I already have a queen.

我姐姐
My sister.

她是最近才成了你的女王的
She wasn't your queen

对吧？
until recently, though, was she?

她杀了你本该拥护的女王
When she murdered your rightful queen

彻底毁灭了提利尔家族
and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.

似乎您的忠诚有些不坚定啊
So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.

在战争中做出任何选择都非易事
There are no easy choices in war.

不管你怎么说你姐姐
Say what you will about your sister,

她出生于维斯特洛
she was born in Westeros.

一辈子都住在这里
She's lived here all her life.

而你呢
You, on the other hand,

杀了你的亲生父亲
murdered your own father

拥护一个外国侵略者
and chose to support a foreign invader.

一个与这片土地毫不相干的侵略者… 
One with no ties to this land...

依靠的还是一支野蛮人组成的军队
with an army of savages at her back.

你宁愿赴死也要守护自己的荣誉
You will not trade your honor for your life.

值得尊敬
I respect that.

或许可以让他披上黑衣 陛下
Perhaps he could take the Black, Your Grace.

无论如何 他都是个真正的战士
Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.

他可以在长城上发挥自己的价值
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

你不能发配我去长城
You cannot send me to the Wall.

你不是我的女王
You are not my queen.

你应该连我一同杀死
You will have to kill me, too.

退回去 闭上你的嘴
Step back and shut your mouth.

你是谁？
Who are you?

一个傻小子
A stupid boy.

我是狄肯・塔利
I am Dickon Tarly,

蓝道・塔利之子
son of Randyll Tarly.

你是你们家族未来的希望
You are the future of your house.

这场战争已经抹消掉一个伟大的家族了
This war has already wiped one great house from the world.

不要让这种悲剧再发生一次了 跪下臣服吧
Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.

我绝不臣服
I will not.

陛下 把他关进牢里呆几周
Your Grace, nothing scrubs bold notions from a man's head

他就不会做这么鲁莽的决定了
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

我言出必行
I meant what I said.

我不是来给他们铐上枷锁的
I'm not here to put men in chains.

如果有这个选项 许多人都会接受
If that becomes an option, many will take it.

我给过他们选择的机会
I gave them a choice.

而他们已经做出了决定
They made it.

陛下 如果你开始把整个家族斩首… 
Your Grace, if you start beheading entire families

我可没说过要斩首
I'm not beheading anyone.

陛下
Your Grace.

蓝道・塔利伯爵 狄肯・塔利
Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

我 坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝一世
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,

镣铐破除者 龙之母
Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons,

判处你们死刑
sentence you to die.

龙焰
Dracarys.

大… 大人
Mymy lord...

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
铁王座上的女王

我们损失了多少兵力？
How many men did we lose?

暂时还没有彻底清点完
We haven't done a full accounting.

打赢战争不能只靠军队
It's not only armies that win wars.

我们有提利尔家族的黄金 有铁金库的支持
We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.

我们可以雇用佣兵
We can buy mercenaries.

虽然不如自己的军队 但也会为我们而战
Not the same as our men, but they'll fight

只要我们给够钱 这点我们会做到的
if they're well paid, which they will be.

我刚刚见识到多斯拉克人是如何作战的
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

他们能打败任何雇佣军
They'll beat any mercenary army.

他们能打败我所见过的任何一支军队
They'll beat any army I've ever seen.

杀人对他们来说根本就不是打仗 只是消遣而已
Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.

她的龙烧毁了千辆马车
Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.

科本的弩炮射出的箭比你还大
Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.

但那也无法阻止它 何况她有三条龙
They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.

这场战争我们是赢不了的
This isn't a war we can win.

所以呢 我们该怎么办？
So, what do we do?

求和吗？
Sue for peace?

我坐在她父亲的王座上
I sit on her father's throne,

她父亲又刚好是被你背叛 刺杀的
the father you betrayed and murdered.

在她看来 她已经胜券在握
And in her mind, she's winning.

你觉得她会提出什么样的条件？
What sort of offer do you think she'd make?

或许我们可以指望提利昂为我们求情
Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf

当做他为谋杀我们父亲和儿子的道歉
by way of apology for murdering our father and son.

不是他做的
He didn't.

你看到了十字弓 你看到了父亲的尸体
You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.

我说的不是父亲
I'm not talking about Father.

提利昂没有杀乔佛里 他和这件事没有任何关系
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.

经历了这一切之后 你竟然还… 
After all this time, it still amazes me that you

是奥莲娜
It was Olenna.

她死前坦白的
She confessed before she died.

是在她喝下你“好心”提供的毒药
And this was before or after

之前还是之后？
she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?

之后
After.

然后你就相信她了？
And you believed her?

如果你是奥莲娜 你愿意看到
If you were Olenna, would you rather have seen

你的孙女嫁给乔佛里还是托曼？
your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?

谁更容易被玛格丽掌控？
Which one would Margaery have been better able to control?

谁更可能会让奥莲娜成为
Which one would have made Olenna

七大王国真正的统治者？
the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

她说的是实话
She was telling the truth.

我不该听你的
I shouldn't have listened to you.

她应该痛苦地死去
She should have died screaming.

她已经死了 就像他儿子
She's dead, like her son,

像她的孙辈们 她整个家族一样
her grandchildren, her whole house.

如果我们没有办法退出这场战争 我们会步他们后尘的
And if we don't find a way out of this war, we'll follow them.

所以我们要么战死 要么投降后被处死
So we fight and die or we submit and die.

我已经做出了选择
I know my choice.

而战士该明白如何选择
A soldier should know his.

琼恩・雪诺
北境之王

它们很美 是吧？
They're beautiful, aren't they?

我的第一反应不是这个词 不过… 
It wasn't the word I was thinking of, but...

不过 没错 它们很美
but, yes, they are.

美丽的野兽
Gorgeous beasts.

对我来说它们不是野兽
They're not beasts to me.

不管它们长到多大
No matter how big they get

或者对其他人来说有多可怕
or how terrifying to everyone else,

它们都是我的孩子
they're my children.

你去了没多长时间
You weren't gone long.

是的
No.

然后呢？
And?

然后 我现在的敌人已经比昨天少了
And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.

你好像心情很复杂
You're not sure how you feel about that.

是的 很复杂
No, I'm not.

你的军队消灭了多少人
How many men did your army kill

才让你从波顿家族手里夺回临冬城？
taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?

几千人
Thousands.

我们两个都想帮助人们
We both want to help people.

我们只能通过我们的力量来帮助他们
We can only help them from a position of strength.

有时候力量是很可怕的
Sometimes strength is terrible.

你刚到这儿的时候
When you first came here,

戴佛斯爵士说你为了你的人民 被刀子捅穿了心脏
Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.

戴佛斯爵士胡说八道呢
Ser Davos gets carried away.

所以 这是一种比喻？
So, it was a figure of speech?

卡丽熙 有个男人声称是您的朋友


乔拉・莫尔蒙
“大熊”

他确实是我的朋友

参见陛下
Your Grace.

琼恩・雪诺 这是乔拉・莫尔蒙爵士
Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,

我的一位老朋友
an old friend.

我侍奉过您父亲
I served with your father.

他是个伟大的人
He was a great man.

你看起来很壮实
You look strong.

治好了？
You found a cure?

如果没治好 我就不会在这儿了
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

我回来继续侍奉您 女王陛下
I return to your service, my queen,

如果您允许的话
if you'll have me.

这是我的荣幸
It would be my honor.

布兰・史塔克
绿先知

沃肯
临冬城学士

渡鸦
Ravens.

我们得派遣渡鸦
We need to send ravens.

我不太相信这信上说的
I put very little stock in it myself.

末日预言从来就没有停止过
Prophecies of doom are never in short supply,

尤其是凛冬到来的时候
especially when winter comes.

我记得沃肯
I remember Wolkan.

山姆威尔・塔利
蓝道・塔利的长子 学城学徒

有点胆怯 但头脑聪明
A little timid, but a sharp mind.

呃 北方已经让很多优秀的学士变得愚钝了
Eh, the North has dulled many good maesters' wits.

很难说是寒冷 酗酒导致的
Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink,

还是被周围的人感染的
or the company.

一个瘸了腿的男孩声称看到了
A crippled boy claims to have seen

长城外死人大军正在前进
dead men on the march beyond the Wall,

是在三眼乌鸦魔力的帮助下看到的？
thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?

是的 这有点过分了
Yes, it is a bit much.

安布罗斯
学城博士

尽管如此 我们还是应该回信 布兰登・史塔克
Still, we ought to write backBrandon Stark.

瘸腿的男孩 你认识他？
The crippled boy. Do you know him?

几年前我曾带着他穿过长城
I led him through the Wall years ago.

我看着他去了长城另一边
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

然后呢？
And?

不知怎么的 一个瘸腿的男孩在长城的另一边
Somehow, a crippled boy

活了下来 而其他人却做不到
survived for years beyond the Wall when no one else could.

守夜人不行 野人不行 没有人可以
Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one.

或许我们应该听听他要说什么
Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.

或许你需要做更多的抄写工作来训练你的脑子
Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.

我感觉你想给出更详细的建议？
I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?

维斯特洛的每个人都信任并尊重你们
Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.

如果你们告诉人们这个威胁是真实的 他们就会相信
If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it.

如果你们建议所有的领主都派兵北上
If you advise all the lords to send their men north

守住长城 他们会照做的
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

如果你们告诉学城的每个学士
And if you tell every maester in the Citadel

去翻找每一本褪色的卷宗中
to search every word of every faded scroll

有关长夜的每一个字
about the Long Night,

他们或许能发现一些东西可以让我们
they may find something that lets us defeat

一劳永逸地打败亡者军团
the Army of the Dead for good.

可以这么做
It could be done.

这条消息有可能是真的
And this news could be authentic.

这是可能的
It's possible.

但这条消息也有可能是
It's also possible that this message

龙女王的策略
is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen

用以引诱南方军队离开他们目前正在守卫的领土
to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending

好轻松征服这些领土
to open those lands to easy conquest.

这种说法似乎比神奇的鸟儿与
That does seem far more likely

瘸子对话更有可能啊
than magic birds talking to cripples.

博士 求您了
Archmaester, please.

那是真的
It's real.

我亲眼见过
I've seen it.

我们会写信给临冬城的沃肯学士
We will write to Maester Wolkan

进一步确认
at Winterfell for clarification.

我向你保证 总会真相大白的
I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.

博士 求你了行了 塔利
Archmaester, pleaseThat will be all, Tarly.

这让我想起荒石城的简妮
It brings to mind the work of Jenny of Oldstones,

那个骗子吹牛说自己是森林之子的血脉
the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest.

别忘了那个所谓的预言家罗德斯
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

那个相信淹神能崛起 摧毁征服者伊耿的
who promised that the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

啊 罗德斯
Ah, Lodos.

他就是父亲和兄弟刚被活活烧死的那个？
Is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive?

恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

太残忍了
Horrible business.

我还没忍心告诉他
I haven't had the heart to tell him yet.

他是个好小伙
He's a good lad.

好吧
Right.

上次我去看 发现鸦楼塌了
The ravenry was falling apart the last time I checked.

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

所有的统治者都要求人民跪地臣服
All rulers demand that people bend the knee.

所以他们才是统治者
That's why they're rulers.

她给了塔利选择的机会
She gave Tarly a choice,

一个起兵反抗她的人
a man who had taken up arms against her.

她还能有什么选择
What else could she do?

不把他连同儿子一起活活烧死？
Not burn him alive alongside his son?

我只是她的首相 无法左右她想法
I am her Hand, not her head.

我无法替她做决定
I can't make her decisions for her.

她父亲在位的时候我也常常这么对自己说
That's what I used to tell myself about her father.

我揪出叛徒 但并不是我把他们活活烧死的
I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.

我仅仅是提供情报而已
I was only a purveyor of information.

当我看到他们苦苦求饶的时候 我常常这样宽慰自己
It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy

烧他们的人不是我
I'm not the one doing it.

当他们的惨叫声越来越尖利
When the pitch of their screams rose higher

烧他们的人不是我
I'm not the one doing it.

当他们的头发着火时
When their hair caught fire

当他们血肉烧焦的糊味弥漫在王座厅时
and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room

烧他们的人不是我
I'm not the one doing it.

丹妮莉丝不是她的父亲
Daenerys is not her father.

她永远不会是
And she never will be

只要找对了谋臣
with the right counsel.

你必须想办法让她听进去
You need to find a way to make her listen.

那是给谁的？ 琼恩・雪诺
Who's that for? Jon Snow.

你看过了吗？
Did you read it?

封蜡上写着给北境之王
It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.

写了什么？
What's it say?

坏消息
Nothing good.

我以为艾莉亚死了
I thought Arya was dead.

我以为布兰也死了
I thought Bran was dead.

我为你感到高兴
I'm happy for you.

你看起来并不高兴
You don't look happy.

布兰看到夜王和他的大军
Bran saw the Night King and his army

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

正在往东海望进军
marching towards Eastwatch.

如果他们通过了长城… 
If they make it past the Wall...

绝境长城已经阻挡了他们有好几千年
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years, presumably.

我得回去
I need to go home.

你说过你人手不足
You said you don't have enough men.

有多少就上多少
We'll fight with the men we have.

除非你加入我们
Unless you'll join us.

那就把国家拱手让给瑟曦吗？
And give the country to Cersei?

我一离开她就会乘虚而入的
As soon as I march away, she marches in.

也许不会
Perhaps not.

瑟曦不相信有死人军团 她认为那只是奶妈们
Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story

编出来吓唬小孩的故事
made up by wet nurses to frighten children.

如果我们能证明她是错的呢？
What if we prove her wrong?

我并不认为她会轻易受邀来看死人
I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.

那就把死人带去见她
So bring the dead to her.

我以为这是我们希望避免的
I thought that was what we were trying to avoid.

我们不需要整支死人军团
We don't have to bring the whole army.

只需要一个就够了
Only one soldier.

这可能吗？
Is that possible?

我见过的第一个尸鬼
The first wight I ever saw

就是从长城外带到黑城堡的
was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.

抓一个这样的 把它带到君临去
Bring one of these things down to King's Landing

向她展示真相
and show her the truth.

带任何东西都没用
Anything you bring back will be useless

除非瑟曦接见我们
unless Cersei grants us an audience

而且在我们进入君临时
and is somehow convinced not to murder us

她能被说服 不杀我们
the moment we set foot in the capital.

她唯一肯听的人就是詹姆
The only person she listens to is Jaime.

而詹姆可能会愿意听我的
He might listen to me.

而你要怎么去君临呢
And how would you get into King's Landing?

我可以把你偷偷带进去
I can smuggle you in,

但是如果金袍子们认出你来
but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,

我警告你 我打仗可不行
I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

其实说什么都是白忙一场
Well, it will all be for nothing

如果我们弄不到一个这样的死人的话
if we don't have one of these dead men.

说得对
Fair point.

那你建议我们去哪儿弄一个呢？
How do you propose to find one?

如果女王允许的话 我会去北境设法弄一个
With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.

你曾命令我找到治疗的方法 再回到你身边服侍
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.

请让我继续服侍你
Allow me to serve you.

自由民会帮我们的
The Free Folk will help us.

他们对北境了如指掌
They know the real north better than anyone.

他们不会听命于乔拉骑士的
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

他们不需要
They won't have to.

你无法在长城以北指挥突袭了
You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.

你不再是守夜人了 你是北境之王
You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North.

我是这儿唯一一个与他们战斗过的
I'm the only one here who's fought them.

我是这儿唯一了解他们的人
I'm the only one here who knows them.

但我并未许可你离开
I haven't given you permission to leave.

无意冒犯 陛下 我无需你的许可
With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.

我是国王
I am a king.

而我来到这里
And I came here

尽管知道你可能会砍我的头
knowing that you could have your men behead me

或者你的龙会把我活活烧死
or your dragons burn me alive.

我相信了你 一个陌生人
I put my trust in you, a stranger,

因为我深知这对我的人民来说是最好的机会
because I knew it was the best chance for my people,

对我们所有人来说都是如此
for all our people.

现在我也请你信任一个陌生人
Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger...

因为这是我们最好的机会
because it's our best chance.

北境之王应该留在北境
The King in the North should stay in the North.

我们并没有选你来统治我们 夫人
We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.

艾莉亚・史塔克

但是也许我们应该选你
But perhaps we should have.

珊莎・史塔克

谷地的骑士们为你而来 史塔克夫人
The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.

对
Aye.

你们都太客气了 大人们
You are very kind, my lords.

但是琼恩是我们的王
But Jon is our king.

他做了他认为对的事
He is doing what he thinks is best.

罗贝特・葛洛佛
深林堡伯爵

约恩・罗伊斯
“青铜” 符石城伯爵

我警告过琼恩也许会有这样的结果
I warned Jon this would happen.

警告他不能离开北境
That he couldn't leave the North

指望北境跟白灵一样坐在那里乖乖等他
and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.

但他没有 他把北境交给你掌管
He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.

呃 他给我留的可不是什么轻松差事 北境领主们都很高傲的
Well, he's not making it easy. The Northern lords are proud.

这些是父亲和母亲的寝室
These are Mother and Father's chambers.

然后呢？
And?

没什么
Nothing.

别那样
Don't do that.

哪样？ 有话就直说吧
What? Say what you mean.

你总是很喜欢好东西
You always liked nice things.

因为好东西会给你一种优越感
They made you feel better than everyone.

你生我的气了？
Are you angry with me?

那些人侮辱了琼恩
They were insulting Jon,

可你只是坐在那儿听任他们侮辱他
and you sat there and listened.

我只是在倾听他们的不满
I listened to their complaints,

这是我作为临冬城公爵夫人的责任
which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.

他们的看法对你来说很重要啊
Their opinions are important to you.

葛洛佛手下有五百人 罗伊斯有两千人
Glover has 500 men, Royce has 2,000.

要是冒犯到他们 琼恩的军队就没了
Offend them and Jon loses his army.

除非他们先没了脑袋
Not if they lose their heads first.

临冬城不是自己回到我们手里的
Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.

是我们把它夺回来的
We took it back,

莫尔蒙家族 霍伍德家族
and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods

野人 谷地人
and the wildlings and the Vale.

我们一起并肩作战夺回来的
All of us, working together.

当然 我知道砍掉别人的脑袋很愉快
Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying,

但是你不可能靠砍头把大家团结起来
but that's not the way you get people to work together.

如果琼恩回不来
And if Jon doesn't come back,

你就需要这些人的支持了… 
you'll need their support...

这样你们就能并肩作战
so you can work together

得到你真正想要的东西了
to give you what you really want.

你怎么会有这么可怕的想法？
How can you even think such a horrible thing?

你现在就在这么想
You're thinking it right now.

你不愿这样
You don't want to be,

但你就是没法赶走这种想法
but the thought just won't go away.

我还有事要做
I have work to do.

我的夫人
My lady.

上次我来这儿的时候 用十字弓射死了我父亲
Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.

上次我来这儿的时候 你用野火烧死了我儿子
Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.

左边靠近山崖那里有条小路
There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.

守卫几乎不去那巡逻
The guards hardly ever patrol it.

台阶太多了
Too many steps.

你不留在这？
You're not staying here?

我要去跳蚤窝办点事
I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.

要是有人把船偷走怎么办？
What if someone takes the boat?

那我们就完蛋了 所以最好快点
Then we're fucked. Best hurry.

我们没时间练这个
We don't have time for this.

我们得预备好守城
We should be preparing the city for a siege.

多斯拉克人要来了
The Dothraki are coming.

所以你就更得训练了
All the more reason for you to train.

除非你打算跟多斯拉克的小屁孩打
Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12yearolds.

呵 我记得他们好像也把你打得够呛
Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.

所以我来了 准备训练
And here I am, ready to train.

为什么要来地下？
Why down here?

因为我觉得你不希望人们看见
I don't think you want people to see

你是怎么挥那把破剑的
how you look swinging that thing yet.

说不定今天就是我不小心干掉你的日子呢
Today might be the day I kill you by accident.

哦 你不会对我动手的
Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

你们 慢慢聊吧
I'll leave you to it.

我必须见一见你
I needed to see you.

只要瑟曦同意一些条件

你大可自己去跟她说

你觉得我每次挥动锤子的时候

我一直都在做准备

可码头在那边 对
The docks are that way. That they are.

我没在那边上岸

It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.

带着走
Take it with you.

但一定要带回来
But bring it back.

我们的女王需要你
Our queen needs you.

我们现在该说再见了

陛下 我…

and remarried him to someone else at the same time

在多恩给他俩举办了秘密婚礼

they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting

and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity,

而击败夜王的秘密
while the secret to defeating the Night King's

可能还置放在某个尘封的书架上 完全被忽视了
probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere, completely ignored.

反正又无所谓 是吧？
But that's all right, isn't it?

反正我们都会变成被束缚着的奴隶 头脑简单四肢发达 受制于邪恶的化身
We can all become slavering, murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

只要我们能知道总主教梅纳德
as long as we can have access to the full records

You're a fucking Mormont?

上一任守夜人总司令？
Like the last Lord Commander?

那是我父亲
He was my father.

You returned the favor, as I recall.

现在我们都在这儿了
Here we all are

在世界边缘
at the edge of the world

同一时刻
at the same moment,

为了同一个目标往同一个方向迈进
