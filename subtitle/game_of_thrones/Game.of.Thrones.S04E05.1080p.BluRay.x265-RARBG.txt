第四季第五集  The First of His Name
托曼一世

愿战士赐予他勇气
May the Warrior grant him courage

佑他穿越艰险
and protect him in these perilous times.

愿铁匠赐予他力量
May the Smith grant him strength

助他肩负重任
that he might bear this heavy burden

愿老妪
And may the Crone,

愿知晓所有人命运的老妪
she that knows the fate of all men,

指明他的必经之路
show him the path he must walk

引领他穿过前方的黑暗
and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
“弑君者”  御林铁卫队长

在七神的光辉之下 我宣布
In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen

拜拉席恩家族的托曼一世
of the House Baratheon First of His Name

大主教
七神的代言人

为安达尔人和先民的国王
King of the Andals and the First Men

和七大王国的的统治者
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

愿他江山永固！
Long may he reign!

愿他江山永固！
Long may he reign!

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
太后

泰温·兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

托曼·拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

玛格丽·提利尔
乔佛里·拜拉席恩的遗孀
托曼·拜拉席恩的未婚妻

真是特别的一天
Special day.

派席尔
大学士

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛” 情报总管

陛下
Your Grace.

陛下
Your Grace.

陛下  陛下
Your Grace. Your Grace.

陛下
Your Grace.

他就在那儿
There he is.

愿他江山永固
Long may he reign.

愿他江山永固
Long may he reign.

他坐在王座上 就像天生的王者
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

对 但他曾经不是
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

确实
No, he wasn't.

你还在为乔佛里哀悼吗？
You still mourn for Joffrey?

他曾是我的丈夫 我的国王
He was my husband. My king.

他本会成为你的噩梦
He would have been your nightmare.

陛下 我觉得… 
Your Grace, I feel--

你很清楚他是什么样的人
You knew exactly what he was.

我也知道
I did, too.

没有任何感情可以代替
You never love anything in the world

你对自己第一个孩子的爱
the way you love your first child.

无论他们做了什么
Doesn't matter what they do.

其实他的所作所为让我震惊
And what he did, it shocked me.

你觉得我是会被轻易震惊的人吗？
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

不是
No.

但我真的被他的行为震惊了
The things he did shocked me.

他只是个孩子
He's only a boy.

一个心地善良 品行端正的孩子
A good boy. A decent boy.

一直都是
He always has been.

我在想 上一个品行端正的国王是谁？
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

他会成为近五十年来第一个
He could be the first man who sits on that throne

真正有资格坐在王座上的国王
in 50 years to actually deserve it.

相对于把他推上王位的那场灾祸
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

这也算是一种安慰了 不是吗？
For all the horror that put him there.

如果他想统治好… 
He will need help...

就需要别人的帮助
if he's going to rule well.

你可以帮他
He has you.

仅有母亲是不够的
A mother is not enough.

你仍想当王后 是吗？
You're still interested in being queen, I take it?

经历了这么多之后… 
After all that's happened--

我知道这听起来很奇怪，但我… 
it sounds strange, I know, but I am--

我还从来没有考虑过
I haven't even given any thought to it,

接下来要做什么
what comes next.

当然 这将会是无上的荣誉
It would be a great honor, of course.

但我需要和我父亲商量一下
But I will have to speak to my father about it.

是啊 和你的父亲商量一下吧
Yes, speak to your father.

我也会和我父亲商量
I'll speak to mine.

接下来 怕是要有一连串的婚礼等着咱们了
We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.

我都不知道该称呼您什么好
I won't even know what to call you.

嫂子？
Sister?

还是母亲？
Or Mother?

乔佛里·拜拉席恩国王死了
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母

在他自己的婚礼上被谋杀
Murdered at his own wedding.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
“大熊”

另外我们已经控制了弥林的海军 陛下
And we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

次子团接管了弥林海军
The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.

谁允许你这么做的？
Who told you to take the navy?

没人
No one.

那你为什么要这样做？
So why did you do it?

我听说您喜欢船
I heard you liked ships.

达里奥·纳哈里斯
前次子团团长

巴利斯坦·赛尔弥
女王铁卫 “无畏的”

有多少艘船
How many ships?

九十三艘 陛下
93, Your Grace.

能载多少人？
How many men can they carry?

不算水手的话 九千三百人
9,300, not counting sailors.

要攻下君临 这些人够么？
Would that be enough to take King's Landing?

兰尼斯特的兵力更多
The Lannisters have more.

他们已为乔佛里征战多年
They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.

疲惫不堪 而且兵力分散
They're tired, dispersed.

如今国王已死
And now their king is dead.

八千无垢者 两千次子团
8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons

驶入黑水湾中
sailing into Blackwater Bay

可以迅雷之势突破城门
and storming the gates without warning.

很难说 也许人数是够了
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

但我们并非要让您只成为君临的女王
But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.

而一万人可征服不了整个维斯特洛
10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

一旦女王渡过狭海
The old houses will flock to our queen

那些古老的家族都将蜂拥至女王旗下
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

那些家族都是些墙头草 只会拥护胜者
The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win,

他们向来如此
as they always have.

还有其他的消息
There's other news.

从渊凯来的
From Yunkai.

没有了无垢者来巩固您的统治
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的侍女

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

贤主大人们重新控制了城市
the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.

他们重新奴役了留在那里的自由人
They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind

并且发誓要向您复仇
and sworn to take revenge against you.

还有 在阿斯塔波
And in Astapor,

由您任命统治城市的议会
the council you installed to rule over the city

被一个叫克莱昂的屠夫推翻了
has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon

他还以“伟大的国王”自居
who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty."

你们退下吧
Please leave me.

你留下 乔拉
Not you, Jorah.

似乎我解放奴隶湾的行动
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay

进行得并不顺利
isn't going quite as planned.

您可以把这一切都抛之脑后
You could sail for Westeros

直接驶向维斯特洛
and leave it all behind.

现在坐在铁王座上的只是个男孩
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

而且很多人认为他是私生子 根本不配继位
A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.

这正是敌人最脆弱之时
They've never been more vulnerable.

在魁尔斯你曾劝阻我不要急躁
You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.

我没听
I didn't listen.

后来一切都顺利
That all worked out well.

如果我连奴隶湾都无法控制
How can I rule seven kingdoms

又该如何统治七大王国？
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

人们有什么理由信任我？
Why should anyone trust me?

人们有什么理由追随我？
Why should anyone follow me?

您是坦格利安后裔
You're a Targaryen.

您是龙之母
You're the Mother of Dragons.

这还不够
I need to be more than that.

我不会让那些被我解放的人重新戴上镣铐
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.

我不去维斯特洛了
I will not sail for Westeros.

那您要做什么？
What, then?

我要做女王该做的事情
I will do what queens do.

我要统治这里
I will rule.

珊莎·史塔克
小恶魔的妻子

培提尔·贝里席
“小指头” 赫伦堡公爵

戴上兜帽
Pull up your hood.

背影足够他们记住了
A memorable shade.

但他们怎么认出我是谁？
But how would they know?

你知道穷人最喜欢听什么故事吗？
You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?

是那些他们永远无缘得见的富家女的故事
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

去鹰巢城只有这条路吗？
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?

这山是无法穿越的
The mountains are impassable.

想要抵达鹰巢城
If you want to get to the Eyrie,

只能通过血门
you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

无论你有多少军队
It doesn't matter how large your army is,

想要攻打血门 你就得走这条路
if you attack this gate, you do it on this road,

三人并排
three men abreast

然后像山羊一样被宰掉
and get slaughtered like goats.

谷地最早的领主们并没有什么财富
The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much,

但他们拥有这些山
but they had these mountains

而且他们懂得物尽其用
and they knew how to use them.

他们在这里建造的城堡从未被攻陷过
And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.

一千年来一次也没有
Not once in 1,000 years.

了解自己的优势 合理发挥优势
Know your strengths, use them wisely,

就能以一敌万
and one man can be worth 10,000.

是谁要通过血门？
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

培提尔·贝里席公爵和他的侄女阿莲
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

唐纳尔·韦伍德
血门骑士

敬礼
Stand to.

敬礼！  敬礼!
Stand to! Stand to!

欢迎回来 培提尔大人
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

劳勃·艾琳
“乖罗宾” 鹰巢城公爵
琼恩·艾琳独子

莱莎·徒利
凯特琳·徒利的妹妹
琼恩·艾琳的遗孀

培提尔叔叔！
Uncle Petyr!

大人
My lord.

我有个小礼物送给你
I have brought you a gift.

贝里席大人
Lord Baelish.

夫人  你看培提尔叔叔给我带了什么
My lady. Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

漂亮的礼物 送给可爱的男孩
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

很荣幸见到您 艾林夫人
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

我的名字是阿… 
My name is Al--

哦 把兜帽摘下来吧 孩子
Oh, do take down that hood, child.

你不觉得我早已知晓你的身份吗？
Don't you think I know who you are?

你以为我会让我的未婚夫
You think I'd let my intended

因为紧急事务离开鹰巢城
leave the Eyrie on urgent business

而我却不知道所为何事？
without knowing what that business was?

我放他离开 他才能把你带来我这儿
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.

你我血脉相连
My flesh and blood.

见到您真是太好了 莱莎姨妈
It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

在其他人面前千万不能这样叫我
You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.

当然 我明白
Of course. I understand.

不能让任何人知道你在这里
No one can know you're here.

否则我们的处境将非常危险
It would put us in a very precarious position.

我一个字也不会透露的
I would never say a thing.

多年以来
The Lannisters want to destroy us.

兰尼斯特家族一直在试图摧毁我们
They've been trying for years.

结果现在他们倒尝到了被摧毁的滋味
Now they know what it feels like.

妈妈说 他们杀了你妈妈还砍了你哥哥的脑袋
Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.

没错 还砍了我父亲的头
They did, and my father's.

他们也杀了我父亲 用毒药
They killed my father, too, with poison.

我想让那个兰尼斯特小矮子飞
I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly,

但妈妈不让我这么做
but Mother said I couldn't.

让他飞？
Make him fly?

从月门飞
Through the Moon Door.

更重要的是
And on top of everything else,

他们还硬要你嫁给那个下流的侏儒
they made you marry that filthy troll.

是的 其实我俩都是被迫的
They did. They made us both.

提利昂大人也不情愿
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

这我一点儿都不信
I don't believe that for a moment.

他有没有强上了你？
Did he force himself on you?

没有
No.

我们从没…   那就好
We never- Good.

罗宾 她是你的表姐 珊莎
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

但在其他人面前 你不能叫她珊莎
But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone

只有在我和培提尔叔叔面前才行 懂了吗
but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand?

珊莎 这是我的儿子罗宾
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

很高兴见到你 罗宾
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

罗宾 带珊莎去她的寝室
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.

走后楼梯
Take the back stairs.

去吧 我们待会聊
Go. We'll speak soon.

你怎么耽误了这么久？
What took you so long?

忙着安排托曼一世继位
Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I,

救出珊莎 还有把她安全送到这儿
extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

她已经安全抵达了 今晚在她身上花的时间已经太多了
She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.

我们今晚成婚吧
Let's get married tonight.

这样的喜事...
Ought we not...

我们不该先通知谷地的领主们吗
inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?

谷地只有一个领主
There's only one Lord of the Vale.

其他人统统去死吧
The others can all hang.

一个个趴在楼梯上像秃鹫一样笑脸迎合
Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards

我丈夫一死 他们就开始觊觎着我
the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.

我认为我们得等… 
I do think that we could wait until--

我等够了 培提尔
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

我们多年前就早已有过婚姻之实了
We had our wedding night many years ago.

你不记得了吗？
Or don't you remember?

清晰如昨日
Like it was yesterday.

什么样的妻子会像我那般待你？
What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?

什么样的妻子会像我那般信任你？
What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?

当你给我那剂毒药
When you gave me those drops

让我下在琼恩的酒里
and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,

我丈夫的酒里时--
my husband's wine--

当你让我写信给凯特
when you told me to write a letter to Cat

告诉她是兰尼斯特--
telling her it was the Lannisters--

往事已成过去
The deed is done.

随风而逝
Faded into nothing.

若不提及 便非真相
Only speaking of it can make it real.

那就今晚吧
Tonight it is, then.

让我先为婚礼沐浴更衣吧
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

等我准备好 就去召修士来
Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.

事先警告你
I'm warning you.

我和我丈夫在床上可是要叫出来的
I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.

我要大声的叫
I'm going to scream so loud,

叫声要传到狭海对岸
they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.

你打算何时举行婚礼？
When will the wedding take place in your mind?

什么时候合适都行
As soon as decency permits.

要先给托曼足够的时间哀悼他的哥哥
After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother

玛格丽也要哀悼她的丈夫
and Margaery to mourn her husband.

两周？ 我觉得合理
A fortnight? That seems reasonable.

不要杂耍 不要侏儒比武
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,

也不要七十七道菜
no 77-course meals.

那你什么时候嫁给洛拉斯？
And your wedding to Loras?

托曼成婚不久后
Shortly after Tommen's.

不久后？ 两周后
Shortly? A fortnight.

我知道你不喜欢他们
I know you don't like them.

我之前也不喜欢你丈夫
I didn't like your husband.

他以前总爱拍我的背
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

我不信任他
I didn't trust him.

这点我们倒是一样
We had that in common.

我们与人结盟 但没必要信任他们
You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.

那可以信任谁？
Then whom can we trust?

只有我们自己
Ourselves alone.

提利尔
The Tyrells

是唯一可以在资源上
are our only true rivals

与我们抗衡的家族
in terms of resources

而我们需要他们的支持
and we need them on our side.

劳勃是不怎么有钱
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

劳勃有我们的资助
Robert had me funding him.

战争开销如流水
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

所以我们之前才能大获全胜
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.

你知道去年西境总共开采了多少金矿吗？
Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?

不知道
Haven't a clue.

来 猜猜看
Go on, your best guess.

磅 吨 还是盎司？
Pounds, tons, ounces?

不管什么单位 答案都是一样
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

这不可能
That can't be.

我们的最后一个金矿三年前就空了
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

那我们怎么应付的开销？
Then how do we pay for anything?

王座欠着铁金库的债
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos

一笔巨债
a tremendous amount of money.

多少？
How much?

很大一笔
A tremendous amount.

铁金库肯定有好说话的人
There must be someone at the Iron Bank

你跟他通融通融
you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

铁金库就是铁金库
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

没有什么 好说话的人
There is no someone.

那也是有人干活的地方 是由人组成的机构
Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.

一座神庙还是一块块石头组成的呢
And a temple is comprised of stones.

一块石头碎了 大不了另一块补上
One stone crumbles and another takes its place.

神庙照样能屹立千年不倒
And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more.

铁金库就是这样一座神庙
That's what the Iron Bank is-a temple.

我们都活在它的阴影下却不自知
We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.

你无法逃离他们 无法欺骗他们
You can't run from them. You can't cheat them.

你不能拿借口来搪塞
You can't sway them with excuses.

如果你欠他们钱 还想活命的话
If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself,

就乖乖还钱
you pay it back.

把提利尔笼络在朝廷里
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown

在这方面对我们有利
will help a great deal in this respect.

都是为了家族利益 我明白
It's for the good of the family, I understand that.

但我的兄弟们未必明白
I'm not sure my brothers do.

我知道你心里认定提利昂有罪
I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.

作为母亲 你有权这么做
And as a mother, that is your right.

但我作为法官 我不能与你讨论审判
But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.

我表示尊重
I respect that.

我们没必要讨论
We don't need to discuss it.

没什么比兰尼斯特家族的传承更重要
The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.

为了保护家族 你发动了一场战争
You've started wars to protect this family.

詹姆不愿继承家业
Turned your back on Jaime

你已与他决裂
for refusing to contribute to its future.

提利昂亲手将家族的未来付之一炬
What does Tyrion deserve

又该付出什么样的代价？
for lighting that future on fire?

乔佛里
Joffrey.

瑟曦
Cersei.

能不能闭嘴
Would you shut up?

我不念一遍这些名字就睡不着
I can't sleep until I say the names.

念遍每个维斯特洛人的鸟名字么
The names of every fucking person in Westeros?

只有那些我要杀的人
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

仇恨可是支撑人活下去的好东西
Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.

比其他玩意儿强多了
Better than most.

等碰上我哥哥
We come across my brother,

也许我们都能在自己的名单上划掉一个人
maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

要是他现在就在这 你要怎么做？
If he were here right now, what would you do?

我会让他闭上臭嘴
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up

让我好好睡觉
so I can get some sleep.

快点 把它念完得了
Go on, get it over with,

你那个杀人名单
your list of doomed men.

就快念完了
I'm almost done.

只差一个
Only one name left.

继续啊
Go on.

猎狗
The Hound.

谢谢
Thank you.

你妈妈一直喜欢甜食 知道吗？
Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?

是嘛？ 哦 那可不
Really? Oh, yes.

晚饭时 她都是直奔蜂蜜蛋糕
At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes,

还有蜜饯杏仁 奶油蛋羹
candied almonds, custard.

所有甜食
Anything sweet.

最后你外公
Eventually, your grandfather

不得不派个修女吃饭时监督她
had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.

毕竟凯特是长女
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

只有保持魅力
It was important that she remain desirable

父亲才能为她安排一门好亲事
so Father could arrange a good match for her

她却开始长胖
and she was starting to get fat.

我母亲长胖？
My mother fat?

她从来不准我
She never let me have my pudding

在晚饭前吃布丁
until I'd finished all my proper food.

我说的是她嫁给你爸去北境之前的事
This is before she married your father and moved to the North.

到你出生时 你父亲的简朴作风已经把她传染了
By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.

婚姻能改变人
Marriage changes people.

我不是让你停下
I didn't mean for you to stop.

继续吃 好好吃
Go on, enjoy them.

好吃吗？
How do you like them?

很美味
They're delicious.

哪里来的柠檬？这里这么高肯定种不了
Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.

哦 当然种不了
Oh, gods, no.

培提尔从君临千里迢迢带来整整三箱
Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.

他知道你喜欢吃柠檬蛋糕
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

他人真好
He's so kind.

他非常关心你
He really cares for you.

想想若不是他 你会在哪儿
Think where you'd be without him.

落入他们手中 因谋杀罪受审
In their clutches and tried for murder.

是的 我非常幸运
Yes. I'm very lucky.

他对你有一种责任感
He feels responsible for you.

哦 我知道 我非常感激
Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.

为什么？
Why?

为什么他觉得要对你负责？
Why does he feel responsible for you?

呃 我是半个徒利
Well, I'm half Tully.

他非常爱您的家族 他爱的是你妈
He loved your family so much. Loved your mother.

不 这才是你想说的
No. That's what you wanted to say.

他爱你 莱莎阿姨 他跟你结婚了
He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.

你母亲从来没有爱过他 从来没有
Your mother never loved him. Never.

凯特总是直奔最甜美的猎物
Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.

最明显的目标 比如你大伯布兰登
The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.

你那英俊 傲慢 残忍的大伯布兰登
Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.

他在决斗中差点杀了培提尔
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.

你妈却对他死心塌地
And your mother loved him anyway.

你妈对培提尔
And now Petyr is risking his life to save you,

还比不上他养的那帮妓女
the daughter of a woman who didn't love him

培提尔却舍命救你
no more than those whores in his brothels.

他跟你说过那些妓女么？ 没有
Has he told you about them? No.

他没告诉过你 她们都用身体做什么可耻的事情？
He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies?

用身体让他做那些可耻的事情？
The vile things they let him do with their bodies?

不 从没有 你怀孕了么？
 No, never. Are you pregnant?

什么？不 我说过 提利昂大人和我从未… 
What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never--

我不是在问提利昂
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

你让培提尔对你的身体做过什么？
What have you let Petyr do with your body?

莱莎阿姨 没有 我…  你这年轻的 美丽的身体
Aunt Lysa, no, I-Your young, pretty body.

什么也没有 我还是处女 别对我撒谎
Nothing. I'm a virgin. Don't lie to me.

你弄疼我了
You're hurting me.

你骗不了我
I'll know if you lie.

我还是处女 我发誓
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

他爱你 莱莎阿姨
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

他只说过我是个笨女孩
All he says is that I'm stupid.

我是个有着愚蠢梦想的笨女孩
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams

永远也不会吸取教训 还有我是个糟糕的骗子
who never learns and I'm a terrible liar,

所以我应该永远说真话
so I should always tell the truth.

我向您发誓他从来没有碰过我
And I swear to you that he has never touched me.

一次也没有 从来没有 嘘 嘘 嘘
Not once, not ever. Shh. Shh. Shh.

没事了
It's all right.

一切都会好的
It will all be all right.

你很快就会成为一个寡妇
You'll be a widow soon.

他们会以弑君罪处决那个侏儒
They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king
