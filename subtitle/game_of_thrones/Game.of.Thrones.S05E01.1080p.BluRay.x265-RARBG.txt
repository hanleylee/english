第五季第一集   The Wars to Come
战争临近

兰尼斯特
泰温之女 雷加王子的未婚妻

我们不应该独自出来  为什么？
We shouldn't be out here alone. Why not?

如果你父亲…  他不会知道的
If your fatherHe'll never know we're gone.

可是一旦他知道了…
But if he finds out...

你不必害怕我父亲
You don't need to be afraid of my father.

你确定吗？
Are you sure?

确定
Yes.

我们不该进去  我们当然要进去
We shouldn't go in. Of course we should.

出去 出去！
Get out. Get out!

我们走吧  不
Let's go. No.

听你朋友的
Listen to your friend.

别人都说你很吓人
They said that you were terrifying

有一口猫牙和三只眼睛
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

但你一点也不吓人
You're not terrifying.

你是个无趣的家伙
You're boring.

你不知道我是什么人
You don't know what I am.

我知道你是个女巫 可以预见未来
I know you're a witch and you can see the future.

说说我的未来
Tell me mine.

人人都想知道自己的未来
Everyone wants to know their future

知道后却又希望自己不曾发问
until they know their future.

这是我父亲的领地 我的领地
This is my father's land. My land.

说出我的未来 不然我就命人把你那双无趣的眼睛挖出来
Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.

你的血
Your blood.

让我尝一口
Give me a taste.

你可以问三个问题
Three questions you get.

但你决不会喜欢我的答案
You won't like the answers.

我已经和王子订了婚
I've been promised to the prince.

我们什么时候成婚？
When will we marry?

永远都不会
You will never wed the prince.

你会嫁给国王
You will wed the king.

总之我会成为王后？
But I will be queen?

哦 是的
Oh, yes.

来日你将母仪天下
You'll be queen.

一段时间
For a time.

直到另一位女人的到来
Then comes another,

她比你年轻
younger,

也比你美丽
more beautiful,

她会推翻你 并夺走所有你珍爱的东西
to cast you down and take all you hold dear.

我 我和国王会有孩子吗？
Wwill the king and I have children?

不 国王会有二十个孩子 而你会有三个
No. The king will have 20 children and you will have three.

这说不通啊
That doesn't make sense.

他们将以黄金为冠
Gold will be their crowns.

也将以黄金裹尸
Gold their shrouds.

快 我们该走了
Come on, we have to go.

我们必须得走了 瑟曦！
We have to go! Cersei!

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
太后

落轿
Bearers, put it down.

马林・特兰
御林铁卫

起轿
Bearers, up.

出发
Away.

玛格丽・提利尔
托曼・拜拉席恩的未婚妻

陛下 我们因您的到来而倍感荣幸
Your Grace, we are honored by your presence.

送葬者都在等着呢
The mourners are waiting.

再让他们等等
They will keep waiting.

我想和他单独呆一会儿
I want a moment alone with him.

总主教
七神的代言人

但是 陛下 这些领主和夫人都是从七国各地
But, Your Grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled

夜以继日才赶来这里的
day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms.

让他们等着
They will wait.

泰温・兰尼斯特
前凯岩城公爵 国王之手

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者” 御林铁卫队长

他从不希望你成为御林铁卫
He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,

但你现在却在这儿 守卫着他的遗体
but here you are, protecting his dead body.

他创造的一切 现在是我们的了
What he built, it's ours.

他是为我们而创建的 本想留给我们的
He built it for us. He meant it for us.

但他们却想要从我们手里夺去
They're going to try to take it away.

夺走这一切  他们？
All of it. They?

外面的所有人 我们的敌人
All of them out there, our enemies.

他们排着队 来确认他是不是真的死了
They're waiting in line to make sure he's really dead.

一看到遮住他眼睛的石头
And as soon as they see the stones on his eyes,

他们就会开始盘算 让我们分崩离析
they'll set to work on tearing us apart.

他们与这无关
They have nothing to do with it.

是杀害父亲的人 是他让我们分崩离析
The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart.

他才是我们的敌人 这么多年来我一直在警告你
He's the enemy. I've been telling you for years.

你却一直在为他开脱
You've been defending him for years.

这正是他们想看到的结果
This is exactly what they want.

现在我们的父亲死了
And now our father is dead

那个小怪物却还活着 潜藏在外
and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath.

是你把他放走的吗？
Did you set him free?

提利昂也许是个怪物
Tyrion may be a monster,

但至少他杀死父亲是有目的的
but at least he killed our father on purpose.

而你杀死父亲却只是出于意外之错
You killed him by mistake.

拜你的愚蠢所赐
With stupidity.

你是个行动派 是吧？
You're a man of action, aren't you?

一想到什么事情 你就立即去做
When it occurs to you to do something, you do it.

从不考虑后果
Never mind the consequences.

看看吧
Take a look.

这就是你造成的后果
Look at the consequences.

就在这里
Here they are.

他比世界上的任何人都更爱你
He loved you more than anyone in this world.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

抱歉
Apologies.

我还是不明白为什么我们一出海
I still don't see why I had to stay

我就非得呆在这个该死的箱子里
in this fucking crate once we set sail.

我可救了你一命
I saved your life.

如果他们抓到了你 那也就抓到了我
If they catch you, they catch me.

所以把你放进那该死的箱子里这件事
I cannot say I feel overly guilty

可没有让我觉得愧疚
about leaving you in that fucking crate.

你知道把自己的屎从通风孔塞出去
Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit

是什么体验吗？
through one of those airholes?

不 我只知道把你拉的屎捡起来
No, I only know what it's like

再扔到海里去是一种什么样的体验
to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

这里是潘托斯？
Pentos?

这里是伊利里欧・摩帕提斯的家
The home of my colleague Illyrio Mopatis,

与我共事的商人
a merchant.

我们在许多年前
He and I met many years ago

经朋友介绍认识的
through mutual friends.

我们这些人一起见证了劳勃・拜拉席恩
A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon

是一场怎样的灾难
for the disaster he was.

所以我们开始试着做一些对王国有益的事情
We tried to do what was best for the realm

比如支持坦格利安家族复辟
by supporting a Targaryen restoration.

接着 各种阴差阳错
And thus began the chain of mistakes

导致你我现在都沦落至此
that has led us both here.

事态不仅没有好转 反而更糟了
Things have gotten worse, not better.

维斯特洛需要被拯救
Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

唔
Mmm.

好多了
Much better.

大人？
My lord?

我不觉得我还是
I don't think I am anymore.

一位“大人”了
A lord.

如果你杀了自己的父亲 你还是个“大人”吗？
Are you a lord if you kill your father?



我估计他们大概不会因为你杀了一个婊子
I don't imagine they revoke your nobility



而撤销你的贵族头衔吧
for killing a whore.

毕竟这事儿比较常见
It must happen all the time.

您已经在跨越狭海的时候喝了一路了
You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.

那会儿还是在箱子里 现在又何必要停？
In a box. Why stop now?

因为我们在讨论国家的未来
Because we are talking about the future of our country.

未来就是一坨屎
The future is shit.

就像过去一样
Just like the past.

你想和以前一样？

照常？

你...

你不用非得这么做

习惯了

嘘
Shh.

嘘
Shh.

鹰身女妖之子？
The Sons of the Harpy?

是的 陛下 他们把这个留在了尸体上
Yes, Your Grace. They left it on the body.

他们此前从未杀过人
They've never killed before.

这只是个时间问题 陛下
It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
“无畏的” 女王铁卫

征服者永远都会遇到抵抗
Conquerors always meet with resistance.

征服他们的不是我 是他们自己的人民
I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母



他们从不把我们当人看 陛下

那么他们应该学着改变看法 弥桑德

他豁出性命争取自由
He did not risk his life fighting for his freedom

不是为了让面具下的懦夫再行夺去
so cowards in masks could take it away.

而我住在这高塔之上
And I did not take up residence in this pyramid

也不是为了眼睁睁看着脚下的城市陷入混乱
so I could watch the city below decline into chaos.

死的人名字叫什么？
What was the name of the man you lost?

白老鼠 陛下
White Rat, Your Grace.

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

我命令你们在圣恩神庙
I want him buried with honor, publically

公开把他厚葬
in the Temple of the Graces.

鹰身女妖之子会听到这个信息的
The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.

这会让他们非常生气
Make them very angry.

生气的蛇才会出击
Angry snakes lash out.

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

这样砍下它们的头就容易多了
Makes chopping off their heads that much easier.

找出凶手 然后带他们来见我
Find the men who did this and bring them to me.

陛下
Your Grace.

托戈・努德霍
Torgo Nudho.

纳斯的弥桑黛
Missandei hin Naath.

我想和你谈谈
I wanted to speak with you.

你想说什么？
Why do you come?

白老鼠 那个死了的无垢者
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

我听说他的尸体是在妓院被发现的
I have heard they found his body in a brothel.

我还听说弥林的妓院
I have heard that more than one Unsullied

不止接待过他一个无垢者
has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.

能问问这是为什么呢？
May I ask you why?

为什么无垢者会去妓院？
Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

我不知道
I do not know.

我该走了
I must go.

奥利
守夜人新兵

举好盾牌 太沉了
Get your shield up. It's too heavy.

沉才能挡着剑
If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.

举好

白灵
琼恩・雪诺的冰原狼

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人事务官

来 再练一次

举好盾牌 向我进攻

Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

山姆威尔・塔利
“杀手” 守夜人事务官

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿和妻子

有多少守夜人杀过异鬼和瑟恩人？
How many brothers can say that they've killed a white walker and a Thenn?

我没准是史上第一个
I might be the first in history.

举好盾牌 这帮家伙都不牢靠
Shield up. These men need a firm hand.

一向如此
Always have.

小偷 盗猎者
They're poachers and thieves.

杰诺斯・史林特
守夜人
前都城守备队队长

艾里沙・索恩
守夜人教头

没一个兵
Not soldiers.

他不喜欢我
That one hates me.

如果艾里沙爵士做了总司令
If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander...

他恨所有的野人
He hates the wildlings.

所有的
All the wildlings.

千万别让他撵我们走 他不一定当选呢
Don't let them send us away.  It's not a sure thing.

丹尼斯・梅利斯特爵士在影子塔当了20年的指挥官
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years

大家都说他人不错
and people say he's a good man.

他和艾里沙爵士一同竞选
He's running against Ser Alliser

山姆 别让他撵我们走
Sam, don't let them send us away.

我和你说过
I told you.

你去哪 我去哪
Wherever you go, I go, too.

你不能走 他们会处死你的
You can't leave. They'll execute you.

很好 很好 转起来 找准重心 呀
Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot. Yah!

盾牌举好
Shield up.

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

国王找你

夫人 你不冷么？
You're not cold, my lady?

从不

The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

用心感受
Feel.

你是个处子？
Are you a virgin?

不是
No.

很好
Good.

陛下
Your Grace.

临冬城的私生子来了
The bastard of Winterfell.

你知道临冬城如今为何人所治？
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
长城上的王

卢斯・波顿
Roose Bolton.

恩 就是那个把匕首插进罗柏・史塔克心脏的叛徒
Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger in Robb Stark's heart.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

你不想为罗柏复仇么？
Don't you want to avenge him?

我想做的事情有很多 陛下
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

但我现在是发过誓言的守夜人弟兄了
But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.

我和你的誓言兄弟谈过
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

很多人喜欢你 他们是好人
Many of them love you. They're good men.

也有很多不喜欢
Many don't.

有人看见你把那个野人姑娘的尸体带到了长城外
You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

为什么？
Why?

她属于那里
It's where she belonged.

有些守夜人觉得
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have

你对野人太过同情
too much affection for the wildlings.

他们只是生在了长城的另一边
They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.

不意味着他们是怪物
That doesn't make them monsters.

无所谓了
No matter.

我将从窃贼之手
I shall take back the North

夺回北境
from the thieves who stole it.

泰温・兰尼斯特死了 他们没了后台
Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now.

我会把卢斯・波顿的脑袋插上枪尖
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

但要拿下临冬城 我还缺人手
But if I'm to take Winterfell, I need more men.

守夜人发誓不参与… 
The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part

我说的不是你们这些该死的守夜人
I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.

我说的是野人
I'm talking about the wildlings.

陛下 您想让野人
Your Grace, you want the wildlings

为您而战？
to march in your army?

凡是效忠我的 统统赦免
If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them.

我们拿下临冬城 北境一平
We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won,

我将承认他们是七国之民
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.

给他们赖以生息的土地
I'll give them land to live on.

这很公道 不止这些
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

我将为他们提供庇护和自由
I'll offer them their lives and their freedom

只要曼斯向我屈膝效忠
if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.

我觉得不大可能
I don't think that's likely.

你敬仰他？
You admire him, don't you?

我尊敬他 他喜欢你
I respect him. He likes you.

说服他屈膝 陛下
Convince him to bend the knee... Your Grace.

不然就烧死
...or he burns.

我有多少时间？
How much time do I have?

今晚之前
Nightfall.

这时候天黑得早
The sun drops fast this time of year.

动作要快 琼恩・雪诺
Hurry, Jon Snow.

举好盾牌
Shield up.

大人 进攻啊
Attack, my lord!

要进攻

我儿子打出生以来

Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.

罗宾・艾林
鹰巢城公爵
琼恩・艾林独子

好战士？
Great warrior?

他打起来和中风的小姑娘差不多

“小指头” 赫伦堡公爵
峡谷守护者

约恩・罗伊斯
“青铜约恩” 谷地领主

大人
My lord.

剑举高点 大人！
Sword up, my lord!

珊莎・史塔克
小恶魔的妻子

有些男孩进步慢
Some boys develop more slowly.

他还小
He's still young.

他都13岁了 13岁都能去打仗了
He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.

他的天赋不在于此 是么
He has other gifts. Does he?

他的天赋是生在好人家
The gift of a great name.

有时候 有高贵的姓氏 就足够了
Sometimes that's all one needs.

再会 罗伊斯大人 感谢您为我做的一切
Goodbye, Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me.

我只是履行我的职责 小姐
I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.

我深信 当我回来
I have no doubt that on my return,

罗宾的技艺会显著提高

至于技艺
As for his skills,

我可不敢保证
I make no promises.

波德瑞克・派恩
布蕾妮的侍从

我们要向北走么？
Will we head north at some point?

他说珊莎在黑城堡有个哥哥
He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.

布蕾妮・塔斯
“美人”

我们偏离国王大道有好几天了
We're a few days' ride from the Kingsroad.

但这会花我们…  我们？
But that will take usUs?

我是看在詹姆・兰尼斯特的份上才留着你
The only reason you're here is because Jaime Lannister

他说你在君临不安全
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

现在你离君临有百里之遥
You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing.

没人知道你长什么样
No one knows what you look like.

也没人在乎 你安全了
No one cares. You're safe.

但我是您的侍从 你知道侍从是什么？
But I'm your squire. Do you even know what a squire is?

侍从侍奉骑士
An attendant to a knight.

我又不是骑士
I'm not a knight.

就是说 你也不是侍从
That means you're not a squire.

额 那我能去哪？
Well, where would I go?

我又不是你妈 我管不着
I don't care. I'm not your mother.

您发誓要找到史塔克家的小姐
You swore to find the Stark girls.

我找到了艾莉亚 她根本不想要我的保护
I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.

或许珊莎会 你能闭嘴么？
 Sansa still might. Will you shut your mouth?

我没想听你的建议
I didn't ask for your advice.

我不想让任何人跟着我
I don't want anyone following me.

我又不是什么领袖
I'm not a leader.

我想要的是为自己认同的领主而战
All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in.

好领主死光了 剩下的贵族老爷都是怪物
The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.

你和罗伊斯大人说我们去五指半岛
You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.

是呀
I did.

但我们是在向西 没错
But we're heading west. We are.

如果他要背叛我们 他早就背叛了
If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.

罗伊斯大人或许有他以为的那样高尚
Lord Royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is,

但在城堡里他可不是孤身一人
but he's not alone in that castle.

你信任所有的骑士 贵妇
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,

马房小弟和帮厨小妹么？
stable boys and serving girls?

不 那你信任马车车夫 或者护送我们的骑士么？
No, do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?

不
No.

但我可花了大价钱
But I pay them well

他们也知道让我失望会落得什么下场
and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me.

那么我们去哪？
So where are we going?

去一个你信任所有人的地方？
To a land where you trust everyone?

我们要去的地方遥不可及
To a land so far from here,

远到连瑟曦・兰尼斯特都鞭长莫及
even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you.

这实在是太 太让人震惊了
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

您父亲是… 
Your father was a

一股不容小觑的力量
a force to be reckoned with.

洛拉斯・提利尔
“百花骑士”

没错
He truly was.

我不敢冒昧声称
I wouldn't presume to claim

梅斯・提利尔
高庭公爵 玛格丽・提利尔之父

有多了解他 但
to have known him as such, but

只要他在 就能让你明白
but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear

这是一个多么强大的人
just how formidable a person you were dealing with.

这是一股多么不容小觑的力量
What awhat a force to be reckoned with.

托曼・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

感谢您的好意

深切哀悼 陛下
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

蓝赛尔表弟 我几乎认不出你了
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

节哀顺变
My deepest sympathies.

我为我儿子的冲撞向您道歉
I apologize for my son's appearance.

凯冯・兰尼斯特
泰温公爵之弟

这没关系 叔叔
Uncle, it's quite all right.

他们自称麻雀
They call themselves sparrows.

一群狂热的信徒
Bloody fanatics.

当然 宗教有它的作用
Religion has its place, of course,

但只是某种程度上的… 
but at a certain point...

泰温还活着的时候 他们绝不会来首都
They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.

我想他会慢慢从泥潭走出来的
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

不管是什么样的泥潭
whatever it is.

不好意思 请便
Excuse me. Of course.

你在黑水河上受的伤看来已经好了
Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.

肉身的伤口无需医治
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

我能为你做些什么？
What can I do for you?

你可以宽恕我
You can forgive me.

你做了什么事 非得我来宽恕？
What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?

我将你引入黑暗之中
I led you into the darkness.

恐怕不曾有人由你引向什么地方
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

我诱使你陷入我们… 
I tempted you into our...

的不正常关系之中
unnatural relations.

何况，无疑还有国王… 
And, of course, there was the king...

他捕猎了野猪
his boar hunt.

他喝了酒
His wine.

我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

我不再是原来的我了
I'm a different person now.

我在七神的光耀下找到了平静
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

你也可以
You can, too.

他们注视着每一个人
They watch over all of us,

随时赐予仁慈
ready to dole out mercy

和公正
or justice.

他们的纪元即将到来
Their world is at hand.

我会为您父亲的灵魂祈祷
I will pray for your father's soul.

等到泰温・兰尼斯特的灵魂需要你帮助的那天吧… 
The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help...

这看上去像多恩 不像
It looks like Dorne. It doesn't.

像极了
It does.

奥利佛
男妓

这里是…  这儿是阳戟城
That's thethat's the Sunspear bit right there.

这里是多恩的山脉
And that's where the mountains are.

而这边是… 
And over here is

沙蛇城？
is Sunsnake?

石戟城？
Stonespear?

沙石城
Sandstone.

对
Yes.

对 沙石城
Yes, Sandstone.

就在这里
Just there.

好吧
Fine.

是多恩
It's Dorne.

我们应该去那儿
We should go there.

根据我的经历
I think we would have a lovely time,

我想我们会过得很愉快
judging by my experience.

那再好不过了 多恩 高庭 随便哪里
That would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden.

别是这儿就好
Anywhere but here.

我们要赶不上晚宴了
We're late for dinner as it is.

你好有礼貌
You're very respectful.

我好饿
I'm very hungry.

你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

奥利法 小姐
Olyvar, my lady.

恐怕我的哥哥
I'm afraid my brother

让国王等急了 奥利法
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

告退了 小姐
My lady.

也许你该考虑做事小心一些？
Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?

为什么？
Why?

反正他们都知道
They all know about me anyway.

是个人都对人了如指掌
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

在这样的地方试着保守秘密有什么意义？
What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?

无论如何 你不该让你的未婚妻等着
In any event, you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

我的未婚妻？拜托
My intended? Please.

泰温死了
Tywin's dead.

这意味着没有人能强迫瑟曦嫁给我
That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.

你运气真好 可惜不是你的
Lucky you. Unlucky you.

你以为我想那个女人嫁给我哥哥？
You think I want that woman married to my brother?

如果她不嫁给我 她就不会去高庭
If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden.

这意味着她会留在君临
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

意味着你会被困在这儿 跟瑟曦・兰尼斯特在一起 而她还是你婆婆
Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

也许吧
Perhaps.

也许？
Perhaps?

也许
Perhaps.

要自杀有更快的方式

但没有懦夫
but not a coward.

你从没提过为什么要救我
You never told me why you set me free.

你哥哥让我这么做
Your brother asked me to.

你可以拒绝
Could have said no.

拒绝弑君者？这太危险了
Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.

放我出来更加危险
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

你在赌命 还搭进去了地位 甚或一切
You risked your life, your position, everything.

为什么？你不是我家人 不欠我什么
Why? You're not family. You owe me nothing.

我不是为了你才这么做的
I didn't do it for you.

我是为了七大王国
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

一个醉醺醺的侏儒做不了七国的救世主
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

我不相信什么救世主
I don't believe in saviors.

我相信有才能的人 在眼前的战争中应扮演的角色

那你该找个战士
You're going to have to find another soldier.

我受够维斯特洛了 维斯特洛也受够了我
I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.

你拥有许多让人钦佩的品质
You have many admirable qualities,

自怨自艾可不是其中之一
selfpity is not one of them.

一个蠢货只要有点运气
Any fool with a bit of luck

就可能天生握有权力
can find himself born into power.

但通过自己努力得到 却要费一番功夫
But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

我不擅长做费功夫的事
I'm not wellsuited for work.

我想你擅长
I think you are.

你有你父亲的政治直觉

你还有同情心
And you have compassion.

同情心？是啊
Compassion? Yes.

我亲手杀死了自己的爱人
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

我拿十字弓射死了自己的父亲
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

我从没说你是个完美的人

你到底想要什么？
What is it you want exactly?

太平
Peace.

昌盛
Prosperity.

一个当权者不会压榨平民的国度
A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.

那里姜饼堆满了城堡
Where the castles are made of gingerbread

黑莓酒溢满了护城河
and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.

历来当权者都是要压榨平民的
The powerful have always preyed on the powerless.

他们当初就是这样上位的
That's how they became powerful in the first place.

或许如此
Perhaps.

或许我们已经习惯了恐惧
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,

以至于以为没有其它的出路
we assume there's no other way.

如果你坐在铁王座上
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

你会让痛苦在王国中蔓延么？
would you spread misery throughout the land?

我永远不会坐上铁王座
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

对 你不会
No, you won't.

但你可以帮助其他人登上那台阶
But you could help another climb those steps

坐上那王座
and take that seat.

七国需要一个比托曼更强大

但比史坦尼斯更温和的人

你有两个选择 朋友
You have a choice, my friend.

你可以呆在伊利里欧的宫殿里
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace

醉生梦死
and drink yourself to death,

你也可以跟我一起前往弥林
or you can ride with me to Meereen,

见一见丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

再下结论说这世界还值不值得为之奋斗一番
and decide if the world is worth fighting for.

我可以在去弥林的路上醉生梦死么？
Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?

什么时候无垢者开始在弥林的街道上巡逻了？

西茨达拉・佐・洛拉克
弥林贵族

看来你的朋友做事并不规矩
Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.

我们在渊凯获得了巨大的成功
Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.

渊凯的贤主同意让权于
The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power

由自由民众和曾经的奴隶主
to a council of elders made up of both

组成的议会
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

所有后续事项都会呈请您的批准
All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.

很好
Good.

但他们也请求能有一些退让
They did ask for some concessions.

退让
Concessions?

政治是一门相互妥协的艺术 陛下
Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace.

我不是政客 我是女王
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

抱歉 理所当然 您才是正确的
Forgive me.You're right, of course.

不过 统御愉快的臣民要比统御愤怒的臣民要容易
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.

我不指望那些明主们乐在其中
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

奴隶制使他们盆满钵满，而我终结了奴隶制
Slavery made them rich.I ended slavery.

他们并没有要复辟奴隶制
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

他们想要重开角斗场
They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.

角斗场？
The fighting pits?

那个奴隶与奴隶相互残杀 至死方休的地方？
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

在您带给我们的这个新世界里
In the new world that you've brought to us,

相斗的是自由民与自由民了
free men would fight free men.

您解放的那些角斗士们
The pit fighters you liberated

为能有机会重新上场而恳求着
plead for this opportunity.

您可以召见他们 亲自询问
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

不开角斗场
No fighting pits.

开启它们将向渊凯和弥林的人们
Opening them would show the people of Yunkai

展现您对他们传统的尊重
and Meereen that you respect their traditions.

我不尊重人与人相残犹如斗鸡的传统
I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

如果您…  还要我说多少次“不”你才能懂？
If youHow many times must I say no before you understand?

不管他想从我这里得到什么 他都不会如愿的
Whatever he wants from me,he's not going to get it.

如果他真的以为我会重开角斗场...
If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

您是应该重开角斗场
You should reopen the fighting pits.

什么？
What?

我母亲是个妓女 我告诉过您的
My mother was a whore. I told you that.

她喜欢喝梨子白兰地
She liked to drink pear brandy.

她越是年老 越是做不成皮肉生意
The older she got, the less she made selling her body,

也就越想要酗酒
the more she wanted to drink.

于是我十二岁的时候 她把我卖给了前一天晚上
So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver

刚刚跟她干过的奴隶贩子
she fucked the night before.

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

为什么？我是个坏小子
Why? I was a bad child.

我块头不大 但身手敏捷
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

而且热衷于战斗
And I loved to fight.

于是他们把我卖给了一个脱罗斯人
So they sold me to a man in Tolos

那人为角斗场训练斗士
who trained fighters for the pits.

我十六岁那年第一次上场
I had my first match when I was 16.

你被卖为奴隶
You were sold into slavery,

被迫战斗到死 以供奴隶主消遣
forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters,

而你却维护角斗场的存在？
and you're defending the fighting pits?

没有角斗场 就没有今天的我
I'm only here because of those pits.

我学着如何像多斯拉克咆哮武士一样战斗
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,

像诺佛斯的僧侣 维斯特洛的骑士一样战斗
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

不久我便名声大噪
Soon I was famous.

当我步入角斗场
10,000 men and women screamed my name

上万男女尖声呼叫着我的名字
when I stepped into the pit.

我让自己主人的口袋里塞满了钱
I made so much money for my master,

他死的时候 给了我自由
he set me free when he died.

我加入了次子团
I joined the Second Sons.

后来便遇见了您
And then I met you.

您贵为女王
You're the queen.

人人对您畏惧有加 不敢说出真相
Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.

除了我
Everyone but me.

在狭海两岸 您结下了数千敌人
You've made thousands of enemies all across the world.

只要他们察觉到您的虚弱
As soon as they see weakness,

便会发动进攻
they'll attack.

此时此地 您要展现自己的力量
Show your strength here, now.

这就是我让无垢者上街巡逻的原因
That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.

任何人只要提着一箱金子都能买到无垢者
Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

您不是无垢者之母
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

您是龙之母
You're the Mother of Dragons.

我不想让自己的脚边再多一个孩子的遗骨了
I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet.

已经好几个周没人见过卓耿了
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

据我所知 他已飞到了半个世界之外
For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world.

我再无法驾驭它们了
I can't control them anymore.

没了龙的龙女王
A dragon queen with no dragons

不是真女王
is not a queen.

维赛利昂？
Viserion?

雷哥？
Rhaegal?

放松 放松
Easy. Easy.

放松
Easy.

那么 我们又见面了
So here we are.

又见面了
Here we are.

当初我们第一次见面 你是我的阶下囚
When we first met, you were my prisoner.

现在 在我们的最后一次见面上...
And now, for our last meeting...

这次见面并不一定非得是最后一次
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

没错 但它很有可能就是
No, but it will be.

曼斯・雷德
“塞外之王”

你知道史坦尼斯想要什么？
You know what Stannis wants?

他要我屈膝降服
He wants me to bend the knee.

想要自由民为他而战
And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

我得承认
I'll give him this much,

他很英勇
he's bold.

国王不应该英勇吗？
Shouldn't a king be bold?

喔 是啊
Oh, aye.

我敬重他
I respect him.

若是他能如愿以偿
If he gets what he wants,

我觉得他会是个比近百年来
I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools

那些铁王座上的傻瓜们更加称职的统治者
sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years.

但我绝不会效忠于他
But I'll never serve him.

你告诉过我 你并非来此攻城略地
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

你说过你的人民已经流够了鲜血
You told me your people have bled enough.

没错
That's right.

我也不想让他们为史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩而流血
I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

你费尽周折说服90个氏族有史以来
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together

头一次团结一心
for the first time in history.

瑟恩人与硬足民
Thenns and Hornfoots,

大冰川的食人部落 甚至是巨人
the iceriver clans, even the giants.

你耗尽毕生心血将它们团结起来 非为权力
A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power.

非为荣耀
You didn't do it for glory.

你集结于此 只为拯救他们
You brought them together to save them

因为即便他们生于长城以北
because none of them will survive the winter,

也无法在凛冬之中幸存
not if they're north of the Wall.

他们的性命难道不比你的骄傲 要更加重要吗？
Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

骄傲？
Pride?

去他妈的骄傲
Fuck my pride.

这与此无关
This isn't about that.

那就屈膝 救你的人一命吧
Then bend the knee and save your people.

他们追随我是因为他们尊敬我
They followed me because they respected me.

因为他们相信我
Because they believed in me.

若我向南方来的国王屈膝 他们片刻间就会作鸟兽散
The moment I kneel for a southern king, that's all gone.

那么外面现在有几千几万个人？
And how many tens of thousands are out there right now?

多少女人？多少孩子？
How many women? How many children?

你不愿走出去拯救他们于水火，原因何在？
And you won't go out and rescue them because why?

因为你怕自己看起来像是吓破了胆
You're afraid of looking afraid.

噢 我的确害怕
Oh, I am afraid.

这没什么好丢人的
No shame in that.

他们要怎么行刑？砍头？
How will they do it? Beheading?

吊死？
Hanging?

他们要活活烧死你
They'll burn you alive.

糟糕的死法
Bad way to go.

实话实说
I'll be honest with you.

我并不想死
I don't want to die.

不想被火烧死
And burnt to death,

我不想我面目焦黑 尖叫而死的一幕
I don't want people to remember me like that,

被我的人记在脑袋里
scorched and screaming.

但即便如此
But it's better than betraying

也比背叛我所信仰的一切要好得多
everything I believe.

那你的人民又将如何呢？
And what happens to your people?

你保全了自己的尊严 光荣地死去了
You preserve your dignity and die standing

他们会传唱你的歌谣
and they'll sing songs about you.

说你宁愿被烧死也不屈膝
You'd rather burn than kneel.

是个大英雄
The great hero.

随后凛冬降临 白鬼向我们所有人袭来
Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all

于是传唱之人将无一幸免于难
and there's no one left to sing.

你是个好小子
You're a good lad.

真的
Truly you are.

但如果你无法理解为什么我不让自己的人民
But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people

去参加一场外邦人的战争的话
in a foreigner's war,

就没什么好解释的
there's no point explaining.

我认为你犯了个很严重的错误
I think you're making a terrible mistake.

有自己做出错误决定的自由
The freedom to make my own mistakes

曾是我最大的奢求
was all I ever wanted.

曼斯・雷德 你曾被称为塞外之王
Mance Rayder, you've been called the KingbeyondtheWall.

而维斯特洛仅有唯一真王
Westeros only has one king.

屈膝臣服 我饶你不死
Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.

托蒙德
“巨人克星” 野人

艾迪森・托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪” 守夜人事务官

跪下就能活命
Kneel and live.

我曾在这儿住了许多年
This was my home for many years.

我希望你在未来的战争中
I wish you good fortune

能交上好运
in the wars to come.

希琳・拜拉席恩

看那 这便是选择黑暗之人的命运
Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.
