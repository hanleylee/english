黄金王冠

艾德・史塔克
御前首相 临冬城公爵 昵称“奈德”

请您原谅 陛下
Your pardon, Your Grace.

恕我无法起身...
I would rise, but...

知道你老婆干了什么好事？
Do you know what your wife has done?

她都是照我的意思做的
She did nothing I did not command.

她到底想些什么呢？
Who'd have thought she had it in her?

你凭什么对我家人下手？
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?

我是御前首相 以国王之名维护和平...
I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace...

你“曾经”是首相
You were the King's Hand.

现在你要为她的罪行负责
You shall now be held accountable.

行了行了 你两个都给我闭嘴！！
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?!

凯特琳必须释放提利昂 而你要跟詹姆和好
Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

他屠杀我的手下...
He butchered my men...

当时史塔克大人在妓院里喝得酩酊大醉
Lord Stark was returning drunk

他的手下攻击詹姆
from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.

安静 女人   詹姆逃出城去了
  Quiet, woman.   Jaime has fled the city.

请允许我把他抓回来接受法律制裁
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

我当你是一国之君
I took you for a King.

闭嘴
Hold your tongue.

你竟眼看着这个人赶走我的一个弟弟 绑架另一个
He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
王后

你应该穿裙子 我才该披挂上阵
I should wear the armor and you the gown.

我会把这当成荣誉的奖章
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.

那就安静地戴好 否则我让你更光荣
Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.

看到她是如何待我了？
See what she does to me?

我亲爱的妻子
My loving wife.

我不该打她的
I should not have hit her.

这不是...
That was not...

不是国王应有的举动
That was not Kingly.

如果我们不作为
If we don't act,

劳勃・拜拉席恩
国王

战争就会爆发
there will be a war.

所以我才要你老婆把小恶魔那畜生
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp

赶紧放回君临
to King's Landing.

她闹也闹够了 就这么结了吧
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

听见没？派只鸟去 就这么结了
You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.

那詹姆・兰尼斯特的事又怎么说？
And what about Jaime Lannister?

怎么处置詹姆？   妈的
  What about Jaime?   I'm half a Kingdom in debt

王国欠了他老爸一屁股债
to his bloody father.

我不知道你是怎么招惹上那帮黄毛的
I don't know what happened between you and those yellow  haired shits.

我也不想知道 我只在乎这个...
I don't want to know. This is what matters...

如果史塔克家和兰尼斯特家拔刀相向
I can't rule the Kingdoms

这烂国家我就没法儿管了
if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats.

所以到此为止吧
So enough.

遵命 陛下
As you command, Your Grace.

请您准许
With your leave,

我尽快返回临冬城处理善后事宜
I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.

见鬼 派只鸟去
Piss on that. Send a raven.

我不准你走
I want you to stay.

我是一国之君 我说怎样就怎样
I'm the King. I get what I want.

我不喜欢我的亲兄弟们
I never loved my brothers.

这是个可悲的事实
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

我选择了你做我的兄弟
You were the brother I chose.

算了 等我打猎回来再说罢
We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

打猎？
The hunt?

让杀戮帮我醒醒脑子
Killing things clears my head.

这期间你得替我坐上铁王座 治理国家
You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.

你会比我更讨厌这玩意儿
You'll hate it more than I do.

坦格利安家那女孩...
The Targaryen girl...

七层地狱啊 你还提她干嘛？
seven hells, don't start with her again.

那女孩必须死 我不想再谈
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

把章子戴上... 你要是敢再丢还给我
Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again,

我跟圣母发誓 会把这烂东西戴在詹姆・兰尼斯特身上
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
卡丽熙

卡丽熙
Khaleesi?

卡丽熙！
Oh, Khaleesi!

伊丽

别跑太快   跑啊 小舞

你打算何时告诉他？
When are you gonna tell him?

现在不行
Not now.

血债血还   跑啊！
  Blood for blood.   Come on!

你必须让兰尼斯特为乔里他们的死付出代价
You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.

你要我开战？   我要你为他们讨回公道
  You're talking about war.   I'm talking about justice.

只有临冬城主
Only the Lord of Winterfell

才可以召集封臣 率军出征
can call in the bannermen and raise an army.

兰尼斯特的人用长矛刺穿了你父亲的腿
A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.

弑君者大摇大摆地返回了凯岩城...
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him...

你要我进军凯岩城 兴师问罪么？
you want me to march on Casterly Rock?

你已经不是孩子了   跑啊
  You're not a boy anymore.   Come on.

席恩・葛雷乔伊
临冬城公爵养子

他们袭击你父亲 他们挑起了战争
They attacked your father. They've already started the war.

而令尊缺席期间 你必须担起保护你家族的责任来
It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.

罗柏・史塔克
临冬城公爵长子

这并非你的责任 这也不是你的家族
And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.

布兰呢？
Where's Bran?

我哪知道 这又不是我的家族
I don't know. It's not my House.

罗柏？
Robb?

独自一个人在黑林子里迷了路
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

我不是一个人 我哥哥和我在一起
I'm not alone. My brother is with me.

我没见着他
I don't see him.

他藏在你披风下面了吗？
Got him hidden under your cloak?

啊 真是个漂亮别针
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

银子做的   我们要别针
  Silver.   We'll take the pin

还有你的马 下来
and the horse. Get down.

快 快给我下来
Be quick about it.

我没办法...
I can't.

他被绑在马鞍上
The saddle... the straps.

怎么回事？你残废了还是怎地？
What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?

我是临冬城的布兰登・史塔克
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

你再不放开我 我便教你们通通没命！
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

把他小鸡鸡割下来塞他嘴里去
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.

这孩子死了就不值钱啦
The boy's worth nothing dead.

班扬・史塔克的亲属？
Benjen Stark's own blood?

想想曼斯会怎么赏我们
Think what Mance would give us.

去他妈的曼斯 去他妈的北境！
Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.

我们往南走 走得越远越好
We're going as far South as South goes.

到多恩就不会有异鬼来找麻烦了
There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.

放下刀子！
Drop the knife!

放开他 我就放你们一条生路
Let him go and I'll let you live.

罗柏
Robb.

罗柏   闭嘴
  Robb.   Shut up.

把剑放下！

不 不要   快啊

你还好吗？
Are you all right?

还好 我没感觉
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

这孩子挺坚强
Tough little lad.

在我们铁群岛 你亲手杀敌之前都不算男人
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy.

干得好
Well done.

你疯了吗？
Have you lost your mind?

没射中怎么办？
What if you'd missed?

他会杀了你 再割布兰的喉咙
He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.

你无权... 无权什么？无权救你弟弟的命吗？
  You don't have the right...   To what, to save your brother's life?

这是惟一的选择 所以我做了！
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

她怎么办？
What about her?

欧莎
女野人

大人 求您饶我一命 我是您的人了
Give me my life, My Lord, and I'm yours.

我才不要练这些笨蛋木剑呢！

你有烦恼

  Yes.   Good!

西利欧・佛瑞尔
布拉佛斯剑术家

烦恼的时候正是练剑的绝佳时机
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

战斗不会发生在你在草地上跟布娃娃
When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens,

小猫咪过家家的时候
this is not when fighting happens.

我才不要跟布娃娃和小...
I don't like dolls and k...

你的心不在这里
You're not here.

你的心深陷烦恼
You're with your trouble.

如果你带着烦恼打架
If you are with your trouble when fighting happens...

你就会更烦恼
...More trouble for you.

就是这样
Just so.

心不在焉的你...
How can you be quick as a snake...

...又怎能迅如蛇...
...Or as quiet as a shadow...

...静如影？
...When you are somewhere else?

你在为你父亲担心 是不是？
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

人之常情
That is right.

你会为他向神灵祈祷吗？   向新旧诸神
  Do you pray to the gods?   The old and the new.

世上只有一个神
There is only one God

那就是死神
and his name is Death.

我们对他也只有一句祷词：
And there is only one thing we say to Death:

“还不到时候”
"Not today."

小子！小子！一个强壮的小子！
A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

她必须吃下整颗心吗？
She has to eat the whole heart?

希望那别是我的马
I hope that wasn't my horse.

她表现得很好
She's doing well.

她不可能全吞下去
She'll never keep it down.

王子骑着马

乔拉・莫尔蒙
杰奥・莫尔蒙之子

“王子骑着马”
"The prince is riding.

“我听见那马蹄声如雷”
I have heard the thunder of his hooves.

“迅疾如风”
Swift as the wind he rides.

“敌人在他面前颤抖不休”
His enemies will cower before him...

“敌人的妻子悲伤泣血”
And their wives will weep tears of blood."

她会生下一个男孩
She's going to have a boy.

韦赛里斯・坦格利安
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的二哥

那孩子不是真正的坦格利安
He won't be a real Targaryen.

不是真龙
He won't be a true Dragon.

他是骑着世界的骏马
The stallion that mounts the world!

“他是骑着世界的骏马”
"The stallion who mounts the world."

“卡奥中的卡奥”
The stallion is the Khal of Khals.

“他将统一多斯拉克民族”
He shall unite the people into a single Khalasar.

“世上所有人类都会归他统领”
All the people of the world will be his herd.

王子在我体内骑着马

我们将叫他雷戈！

王子在我体内骑着马

Rhaego! Rhaego!

雷戈！雷戈...
Rhaego! Rhaego...

他们爱戴她
They love her.

雷戈！雷戈！
Rhaego! Rhaego!

雷戈！雷戈...
Rhaego! Rhaego...

她终于成为了他们的王后
She truly is a queen today.

别让他们看见你在维斯・多斯拉克城中佩剑
Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

你清楚这里的规矩
You know the law.

野蛮人的规矩管不着我
It's not my law.

这些蛋不是你的
They don't belong to you.

她的就是我的
Whatever is hers is also mine.

过去或许是这样
Once, perhaps.

卖一个蛋 我就能买到一艘船
If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship.

卖二个蛋 我能再买一支军队
Two eggs... a ship and an army.

你把三个蛋都偷走了   我需要一支所向披靡的军队
  And you have all three.   I need a large army.

我是坦格利安王朝最后的希望了 莫尔蒙
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

那个历史上最伟大的王朝
The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen

我从五岁起就肩负着复兴它的重责大任...
on my shoulders since I was five years old...

但没有谁给过我 她在那个帐篷里得到的那些东西
and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent.

从来没有
Never.

一丝一毫都没有
Not a piece of it.

我该如何完成自己的使命？
How can I carry what I need to carry without it?

没有恐惧没有爱戴 如果我还是个穷光蛋 又怎能复国？
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

瞧 你站在这里 一身正气荣誉的模样
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.

但别以为我没发现你盯着我妹妹的眼神
You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm?

别以为我不晓得你心里的盘算
Don't think I know what you want?

我无所谓 她归你了
I don't care. You can have her.

她可以继续当她的蛮子王后
She can be Queen of the savages and dine

尽情享用血淋淋的美味马肉
on the finest bloody horseparts,

而你看上她哪点也可以去尽情享用
and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.

我只要你站开
But let me go.

我可以站开
You can go.

但蛋必须留下
You can't have the eggs.

你对我发过誓
You swore an oath to me.

忠诚二字在你眼中就一文不值么？
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

忠诚在我眼中意味着一切
It means everything to me.

但你却不肯站开
And yet here you stand.

我不会站开
And yet here I stand.

莫德！
Mord!

莫德！
Mord!

莫德！
Mord!

莫德！
Mord!

莫德
Mord.

又吵！
Noise again!

金子的事...   没有金子！
  About the gold...   No gold!

没有金子   听我说！
  No gold.   Listen to me!

听我说
Listen to me.

有时候眼光
Sometimes possession

要放长远...
is an abstract concept...

他们抓我的时候把我的钱包搜走了
When they captured me, they took my purse,

但里头的金子还是我的
but the gold is still mine.

钱包在哪儿？
Where?

在哪儿？我不晓得在哪儿
Where? I don't know where,

不过只要我获得自由...
but when they free me...

你要自由？
You want free?

跳下去就有
Go be free.

你听过这句俗话没
Have you ever heard the phrase

“跟兰尼斯特一样有钱”？
"rich as a Lannister"?

你当然听过！
Of course you have!

你是个聪明人
You're a smart man.

你知道兰尼斯特家有很多金子
You know who the Lannisters are.

我是提利昂・兰尼斯特
I am a Lannister.

泰温公爵之子！
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

想必你还听过这句俗话：
And of course, you have also heard the phrase,

“兰尼斯特有债必还”
"a Lannister always pays his debts."

只要帮我向艾林夫人传个口信
If you deliver a message from me...

我就算欠你的债了
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.

只要你传个口信
I will owe you gold.

等我逃过了这一劫...我一定会的
If you deliver the message

我就给你很多很多金子
and I live, which I very much intend to do.

什么口信？
What message?

告诉她 我打算认罪
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

莱莎・徒利
凯特琳・徒利之妹 琼恩・艾林之妻

你有意认罪？
You wish to confess your crimes?

是的 夫人
Yes, My Lady.

我认罪 夫人
I do, My Lady.

天牢可以让任何人屈服
The sky cells always break them.

说吧 小恶魔
Speak, Imp.

在天上诸神面前坦白罪行
Meet your gods as an honest man.

各位陛下夫人 我该从何说起呢？
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

我承认
I'm a vile man,

我是个小坏蛋
I confess it.

犯下的罪过数不胜数
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

撒谎行骗赌博嫖妓
I have lied and cheated...

无恶不作
gambled and whored.

我不会打架
I'm not particularly good at violence,

但我擅长拿别人当枪使
but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.

您可能想听些具体事例吧？
You want specifics, I suppose.

我七岁那年
When I was seven I saw a servant girl

见到一个仆女在河边洗澡
bathing in the river.

便偷了她的袍子
I stole her robe.

她只好光着身子
She was forced to return to the castle

眼泪汪汪地回城堡
naked and in tears.

每当我闭上眼睛
If I close my eyes,

还能看见她的奶子蹦啊蹦的
I can still see her tits bouncing.

十岁那年 我把叔叔的靴子填满了羊屎
When I was 10 I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

事后还矢口否认 嫁祸给某位侍从
When confronted with my crime,

那可怜的孩子因此挨了鞭打
I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged

我却逃脱了惩罚
and I escaped justice.

我十二岁的时候
When I was 12

在一罐海龟汤前掏出了裤裆里的鳗鱼
I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.

我猛搓这独眼蛇
I flogged the one  eyed snake.

剥开香肠皮
I skinned my sausage.

把秃头哭出的泪水
I made the bald man cry

滴进了汤汁里头
into the turtle stew,

这汤是给我老姐喝的
which I do believe my sister ate.

至少我希望她喝了
At least I hope she did.

还有回我带了一头蠢驴和一个蜂窝
Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb

进了妓院...   住嘴！
  into a brothel...   Silence!

然后呢？
What happened next?

你以为你在干什么？
What do you think you're doing?

我在认罪啊
Confessing my crimes.

提利昂大人
Lord Tyrion, you are accused

凯特琳・徒利
临冬城公爵夫人

你被控派人行刺我卧病在床的儿子布兰
of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed,

以及密谋害死我妹夫
and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband

国王之手琼恩・艾林大人
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

噢 实在是抱歉
Oh, I'm very sorry.

我对杀人可是一窍不通
I don't know anything about all that.

你闹也闹够了
You've had your little joke.

想必玩得很愉快
I trust you enjoyed it.

莫德 带他回地牢
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

这次找个更小...
But this time find a smaller cell...

地板更斜的房间给他
With a steeper floor.

艾林谷里
Is this how justice

到底还有没有天理？
is done in the Vale?

你控告 我否认
You accuse me of crimes,

你就把我扔进天牢
I deny them, so you throw me into a cell

挨饿受冻
to freeze and starve?

请问国王的正义到哪里去了？
Where is the King's Justice?

我要求公平审判！
I am accused and demand a trial!

要是审判结果你的确有罪
If you're tried and found guilty,

那么依照国王的律法 你只有死路一条
then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.

我很清楚国王的律法
I understand the law.

鹰巢城里没有刽子手
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

我们的方式更优雅
Life is more elegant here.

把月门打开
Open the moon door.

兰尼斯特大人 你要审判
You want a trial, My Lord Lannister.

那好
Very well.

你想说什么 我儿子都会倾听
My son will listen to whatever you have to say,

接着你将接受他的判决
and you will hear his judgment.

罗宾・艾林
琼恩・艾林之子

然后...你要么走大门
Then you will leave...

不然就从这个门出去
By one door or the other.

无需惊动罗宾大人
No need to bother Lord Robin.

我要求比武审判
I demand a trial by combat.

你有这个权利
You have that right.

夫人 求您恩准我
My Lady, I beg the honor.

为您而战
Let me be your champion.

这份荣耀应该归我所有
The honor should be mine.

看在我对您夫君敬爱有加的份上
For the love I bore your Lord husband,

让我替他报仇罢
let me avenge his death.

我愿为您而战 夫人   这将是我的荣幸
  I'll fight for you, My Lady.   It'll be my honor.

我的荣幸...   我要看坏蛋飞！
  The honor should be mine.   Make the bad man fly!

瓦狄斯爵士...
Ser Vardis...

你怎么不说话
You're quiet.

你就不想为我夫君报仇雪恨吗？
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

我全心全意地敬爱他 夫人
With all my heart, My Lady.

但小恶魔只有我一半高
But the Imp is half my size.

宰杀这种人还叫主持正义 那太可耻了
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.

瓦狄斯・伊根
鹰巢城侍卫队长

同意
Agreed.

要求比武审判的也是你
You demanded a trial by combat.

这会儿我还要像你一样 给自己找个代理骑士
Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.

夫人
My Lady,

我很乐意为您迎战小恶魔的代理骑士
I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

恐怕这是不智之举 爵士先生
I wouldn't be too glad, Ser.

我指名我哥哥詹姆・兰尼斯特
I name my brother Jaime Lannister.

弑君者
The Kingslayer

离此有几百里
is hundreds of miles from here.

派只鸟把他找来 我很乐意等
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

你今天就得接受审判
The trial will be today.

有谁愿意为我而战？
Do I have a volunteer?

有吗？
Anyone?

有吗？
Anyone?

可以认定没人愿意为...
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

我代侏儒上场罢
I'll stand for the dwarf.

波隆
佣兵

要酒吗 陛下？
More wine, Your Grace?

我刚才说到哪儿来着   单纯的时代
  What was I saying?   Simpler time.

对！单纯的时代 你太小不记得
It was! It was. You're too young to remember.

那时候真叫个单纯 是不是 塞尔弥？
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

是的 陛下   恶贯满盈的对手
  It was, Your Grace.   The enemy was right in the open,

堂堂正正地等着你 跟他大战三百回合
vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.

现今不一样了
Nothing like today.

听起来很欢乐   欢乐？是很欢乐
  It sounds exhilarating.   Exhilarating, yes.

比你热衷的那些
Not as exhilarating as those balls

化装不化装的舞会欢乐多了
and masquerades you like to throw.

你上过河间地的妞吗？
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

似乎上过一个
Once. I think.

蓝礼・拜拉席恩
风息堡公爵 国王幼弟

似乎？这种事怎么能忘
You think? I think you'd remember.

我们那时代
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

没把七大王国的妞全上过一遍就不算男人
until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms

七国外加河间地
and the Riverlands.

这叫“大杀八方”   你临幸了不少妞儿
  We used to call it "making the eight."   Those were some lucky girls.

你有没完成“大杀八方” 巴利斯坦？
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
御林铁卫队长

微臣惭愧 陛下
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

那才是好时代咧
Those were the days.

那究竟是什么样的时代？
Which days, exactly?

维斯特洛一分为二 百万人在战火中丧生的时代？
The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?

或是在此之前 疯王跟随自己脑子的疯狂声音
Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies

肆意屠杀妇女儿童的时代？
because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?

或是更早 恶龙把城市烧成灰烬的时代？
Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?

别激动 小子
Easy, boy.

你是我弟弟 但我是你的国王
You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.

烂醉如泥的你
I suppose it was all rather heroic...

掏出那话儿干了某个可怜的河间地妓女
If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore

完成了大杀八方的伟业！真他妈英勇！
to shove your prick inside and make the eight.

蓝赛尔・兰尼斯特
国王的侍从 王后的堂弟

要酒吗 陛下？
More wine, Your Grace?

他们在河间地四处放火
They burned most everything in the Riverlands:

我们的田地谷仓和家园
Our fields; Our granaries;

都被他们烧掉了
our homes.

他们抓走我们的女人...一遍又一遍地凌辱
They took our women, then they took 'em again.

发泄完以后
When they was done, they butchered them

像宰牲口一样把她们杀死
as if they was animals.

他们把沥青
They covered our children

浇在孩子们身上
in pitch

再将他们活活烧死
and lit them on fire.

看来是土匪
Brigands, most likely.

他们不是强盗
They weren't thieves.

不是来抢东西的
They didn't steal nothing.

他们甚至把东西给留下了 陛下
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

听取请愿的是御前首相 不是国王本人
It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King.

国王陛下正在打猎
The King is hunting.

鱼 徒利家族的纹章
Fish. The Sigil of House Tully.

培提尔・贝里席
财政大臣 “小指头”

这不就是尊夫人的本家吗 我的好大人？
Isn't that your wife's house... Tully, My Lord Hand?

这帮人 他们有没有家徽？
These men, were they flying a Sigil?

有没有打旗帜？   没有 陛...
  A banner?   None, your...

首相大人
Hand.

只是那领头的...
The one who was leading them...

他比我见过最高的人还高上一尺
Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met,

我亲眼见他把我们的铁匠劈成两半
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

他只需一剑
saw him take the head off a horse

就能生生切下马头
with a single swing of his sword.

这人我们好象认识
That sounds like someone we know.

魔山
The Mountain.

你描绘的是格雷果・克里冈爵士
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

派席尔
大学士

格雷果爵士何必去打家劫舍？
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

他可是涂抹过圣油的骑士啊
The man is an anointed knight.

都说他是泰温・兰尼斯特的疯狗
I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

相信你也听说了
I'm sure you have as well.

兰尼斯特家
Can you think of any reason

会因为什么
the Lannisters might possibly have

而对尊夫人动怒呢？
for being angry with your wife?

你认为兰尼斯特家
If the Lannisters

会公然袭击
were to order attacks on villages

国王保护下的村庄吗？
under the King's protection,

这...   这就跟光天化日之下在都城大街上
  it would be...   That would be almost as brazen

袭击御前首相一样让人无法容忍
as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.

可...
Well...

我无法归还你们的家园
I cannot give you back your homes

更不能让死者复生
or restore your dead to life,

但或许能以劳勃国王之名
but perhaps I can give you justice

还你们一个迟来的公道
in the name of our King, Robert.

贝里・唐德利恩伯爵
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

你带上一百人
You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men

贝里・唐德利恩
黑港伯爵

即刻前往格雷果爵士的城堡   悉听尊令
  and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.   As you command.

以安达尔人和先民的国王
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,

七国统治者
the first of his name,

暨全境守护者
King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

拜拉席恩家族的劳勃一世之名
and protector of the realm,

我命令你们
I charge you to bring the King's Justice

制裁虚伪的骑士格雷果・克里冈
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

以及所有与他合谋的共犯
and all those who shared in his crimes.

我在此宣告
I denounce him

褫夺其骑士身份
and attaint him.

褫夺其一切官阶与职衔
I strip him of all ranks and titles,

收回其一切封地税赋和房产
of all lands and holdings,

并明令处之以死刑   大人啊...
  and sentence him to death.   My Lord...

这...这么做是不是太激进了？
This... this is a drastic action.

我们还是等劳勃国王回来再定夺吧
It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.

派席尔大学士   大人
  Grand Maester Pycelle.   My Lord.

请派一只乌鸦去凯岩城
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

召泰温・兰尼斯特火速入朝
Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court

为其封臣的罪行做出解释
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

如果他在两周之内不能现身
He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown

就是自承叛党 为国王之敌
and a traitor to the realm.

大人 您的处置很有魄力 也值得钦佩
A bold move, My Lord, and admirable.

但是狮子尾巴不好踩啊
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

泰温・兰尼斯特可是七国上下最富有的人
Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.

打起仗来 金钱比士兵更重要
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

那为什么做国王的是劳勃
Then how come Robert is King

却不是他泰温・兰尼斯特？
and not Tywin Lannister?

稳住！
Hold!

打他 打他！   上啊 瓦狄斯爵士！
  Attack attack!   Come on, Ser Vardis!

打他！
Attack!

胆小鬼 有种就光明正大地打！
Stand and fight, coward!

好样的！
Yes!

瓦狄斯爵士 打够了！快收拾他！
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

你怎么了？站起来啊！
What are you doing? Get up!

起来 起来 站起来！
Get up, get up, get up!

快举剑 举剑！
Raise your sword. Raise it!

站起来 加油！
Get up, man!

起来！   快站起来！
  On your feet!   Get up!

起来战斗 瓦狄斯爵士！
Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!

不！放过他！
No! Have mercy!

结束了？
Is it over?

你这样打毫无荣誉可言！
You don't fight with honor!

我没有
No.

他有
He did.

现在我可以让那个小坏蛋飞了吗？
Can I make the little man fly now?

这个小坏蛋不飞
Not this little man.

这个小坏蛋要回家了
This little man is going home.

你身上有我的东西罢
I believe you have something of mine.

兰尼斯特有债必还
A Lannister always pays his debts.

茉丹
临冬城的修女

你把头发盘成了南方小姐的式样
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.

珊莎・史塔克
临冬城公爵长女

是啊 怎么了？我们在南方住
Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.

可你要始终牢记自己来自哪里
It's important to remember where you come from.

你母亲不见得会欣赏你的新发型
I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.

我母亲也不是北方人
My mother isn't from the North.

这个我知道
I'm aware of that.

你管这些闲事做什么？
Why do you care?

你头巾下面有头发吗
Do you even have hair under there?

有 我当然有
Yes. I have hair.

我没见过
I've never seen it.

你想看看吗？
Would you like to?

不想
No.

话说你是哪儿的人？南方人还是北方人？
Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?

我的家乡是一个小村庄 它坐落在...
I come from a very small village in...

唉 算了
Oh, wait.

这个也与我无关
I just realized I don't care.

珊莎...   修女
  Sansa...   Septa.

你越来越没礼貌了
Now you are being rude.

王子殿下
My prince.

王子殿下
My prince.

亲爱的小姐
My Lady.

我承认我最近几周的言行
I fear I have behaved monstrously

实在很粗鲁
the past few weeks.

可以吗？
With your permission?

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
大王子

它真漂亮
It's beautiful,

它就跟你母亲戴的那个一样
like the one your mother wears.

将来你是王后
You'll be queen someday.

只有它才配得上你
It's only fitting you should look the part.

你能原谅我的粗鲁举止吗？
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

我没什么好原谅的啊...
There's nothing to forgive.

你是我的未婚妻
You're My Lady.

有朝一日 我们会在王座厅里成亲
One day we'll be married in the throne room.

七国上下的陛下夫人们都会到场参加
Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come,

从北方的最后壁炉城
from the last hearth in the North

到南方的盐海岸
to the Salt Shore in the South,

届时你将母仪天下
and you will be Queen over all of them.

我再也不会欺负你
I'll never disrespect you again.

再也不会亏待你了
I'll never be cruel to you again.

你相信我吗？
Do you understand me?

我会永远爱护你
You're My Lady now,

从今天
from this day

直到永远
until my last day.

停下
Stop.

停下！
Stop!

你干什么？   我要去君临
  What are you doing?   Going to King's Landing.

就坐这芜菁马车？
In a turnip cart?

我会在白港找条船
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.

付得起船费么？
And you can afford that?

我有些客人比某人可大方多了
Some of my friends are more generous than others.

你这种货色 君临城里怕是有上千个
There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.

罗丝
妓女

这么说 我不会寂寞啦
So I'll have lots of company.

哼 你会出人头地...
Yes, you'll be very popular...

然后就会有哪个胖陛下找上门
Until some fat lord comes to visit

脑满肠肥 鸡巴却小
with a big belly and a little prick

硬不起来就把你揍得满地找牙
and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.

我就算留下又怎样？
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

还能成为葛雷乔伊夫人
Will I become Lady Greyjoy,

成为铁群岛的女主人吗？   别傻了
  mistress of the Iron Islands?   Don't be a fool.

我听说詹姆・兰尼斯特在君临的大街上
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark

袭击了史塔克公爵
in the streets of King's Landing.

很快 方圆百里的男人都会被征集参军
Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon

恐怕大都将一去不返
and most of them will never come back.

我在这里已经没生意可做了
There's nothing left for me here.

走吧 史蒂芬
Let's go, Stefon.

让我看最后一眼！
Let me see it one more time!

看什么？
See what?

我会想你的
I'm going to miss you.

我知道
I know.

我准备送你们回临冬城
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

什么？！   听着...
  What?!   Listen...

那乔佛里怎么办？   你是不是腿伤好不了了
  What about Joffrey?   Are you dying because of your leg?

所以才送我们回家？
Is that why you're sending us home?

什么？不是的
What? No.

求求你 父亲大人 求求你别这样
Please, father. Please don't.

不要 我还要跟西利欧上课呢
You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio.

我好不容易才有一点进步
I'm finally getting good.

这不是惩罚
This isn't a punishment.

我是为了你们的安危考虑才送你们回去
I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.

我们可以带西利欧一起走吗？
Can we take Syrio back with us?

谁理你的笨舞蹈老师啊？
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?

我不能走啊
I can't go.

我是要嫁给乔佛里王子的
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.

我爱他 我想作他的王后
I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen

为他生孩子   七层地狱啊
  and have his babies.   Seven hells.

等你长大
When you're old enough,

我会找个配得上你的人
I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you,

勇敢温柔又强壮...
someone who's brave and gentle and strong...

我才不要什么勇敢温柔又强壮的人 我只要他！
I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him!

他会成为有史以来最伟大的国王 一头黄金狮子
He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion,

我们会有许多漂亮的金发儿子
and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.

笨蛋 他不是狮子
The lion'sot s Sigil, idiot.

他跟他老爸一样是鹿
He's a stag, like his father.

他才不是！他一点都不像那酒鬼老国王
He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk King.

去吧 姑娘们 叫修女帮你们收拾行李
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start packing your things.

等一下！   走吧
  Wait!   Come on.

这不公平！
But it's not fair!

Where is she? I'm here for the feast.

  The whore's feast?   Come.

卓戈卡奥说你的座位在那里
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

角落里
Back there.

那不是国王坐的地方
That is no place for a King.

你不是国王
You are no King.

Keep away from me!

韦赛里斯 求求你
Viserys, please.

原来她在这儿
There she is.

把剑收起来 你会把我们通通害死
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

他们奈何不了我们
They can't kill us.

他们不能在圣城里流血
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

但我能
But I can.

我只要属于我的东西
I want what I came for.

我只要他答应我的那顶王冠
I want the crown he promised me.

他买了你
He bought you.

却没有付钱
But he never paid for you.

叫他遵守约定 否则我就要收回你
Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.

他可以留下他的种
He can keep the baby.

我会把那野种割下来给他
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

我会把他恳求的东西赐给他
I will give to him what he wants.

我要赐他一顶黄金王冠
I will give to him a golden crown

世人会为此景战栗不止
and men will tremble when they will see it.

他说什么？
What's he saying?

他说好吧
He says yes.

你将会拥有一顶...
You shall have a golden crown...

任谁看了都会颤抖的黄金王冠
That men shall tremble to behold.

我要的只是这个
That was all I wanted.

他答应要给我的
What  what was promised.

拿下！
Seize him!

不！
No!

不行！你们不准碰我
No! You cannot touch me.

我是真龙 真龙！
I am the Dragon. I am the Dragon!

我要我的王冠！
I want my crown! Ahh!

把锅子倒空
Empty that pot.

请您转过头 卡丽熙   不

丹妮 求你！
Dany, please!

给国王戴的王冠！
A crown for a King.

卡丽熙？
Khaleesi?

他不是真龙
He was no Dragon.

真龙不怕火
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.
