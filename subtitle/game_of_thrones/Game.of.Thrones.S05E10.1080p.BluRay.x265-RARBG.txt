第五季第十集  Mother's Mercy
圣母慈悲

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

注意挡风
Brace the wind.

国王陛下 光之王实现了他的诺言
The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king.

他的火焰将积雪融化
His fires have melted the snows away.

前方的障碍已经扫清
The way ahead is clear.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩
长城上的王

我们将奔袭临冬城
We ride for Winterfell.

而你将赢得战斗
And you will take it.

光之王让我看见波顿家的旗帜在燃烧
The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning.

您会得到您理应得到的
You will receive what is yours by right.

陛下
Your Grace.

准备整队
Prepare to form up.

陛下
Your Grace.

快说
Tell me.

好多人在天亮以前逃跑了
The men, many deserted before dawn.

有多少
How many?

将近一半
Nearly half.

雇佣兵都逃了 还带走了所有的马
All the sellswords with all the horses.

陛下
Your Grace.

说吧 总不见得能比兵变更糟
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

赛丽丝·佛罗伦
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩之王后

把她放下来
Cut her down.

陛下
Your Grace.

刚刚有人看到梅丽珊卓女士骑马从营地里面出去了
The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

让剩下的人列成行军队列
Get the men into marching formation.

向临冬城进发
On to Winterfell.

琼恩·雪诺
守夜人总司令

他举起双手
He raised his hands

他们就全都站了起来
and they all stood up at once.

这些怪物是全世界最庞大的军队 成千上万 无穷无尽
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

所以你打算怎么办？
So what are you gonna do?

山姆威尔·塔利
“杀手”  守夜人事务官

我只能祈祷他们不知道怎么爬上长城
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

我们不是有龙晶… 
But the dragonglass...

没人能把它们带回来
No one's ever getting that back now.

而且这无济于事
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

除非我们有一座山那么多的龙晶
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

但是你杀了一只异鬼
But you killed a white walker.

我用长爪杀的
With Longclaw.

我看见他们击碎钢斧就像打碎玻璃一样
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

但长爪…  是瓦雷利亚钢做的
But Longclaw... Is Valyrian steel.

七大王国还剩下多少把瓦雷利亚钢剑
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

肯定不够
Not enough.

我大概是历史上首任
The first Lord Commander in history

为了保护野人
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers

而牺牲兄弟们的司令官了
to save the lives of wildlings.

跟黑城堡里面最被人讨厌的人交朋友是什么感觉
How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

我一到这儿你就是我的朋友了
You were friends with me when I first came here.

那时候我也不见得讨人喜欢
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

敬我们
Here's to us, then.

随他们唧歪去吧
Long may they sneer.

怎么
What?

我想求你件事
I wanted to ask you something.

求你下一道命令
To ask something of you.

命我 吉莉 还有孩子前往旧镇
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

然后我可以去学着成为一个学士
so I can become a maester.

那才是我该做的 而不是像现在这样
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

山姆 我需要你留下
I need you here, Sam.

如果你走了 我还能信任谁的建议呢
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

呃 还有艾迪嘛
Well, there's Edd.

何况如果我能成为学士 对你的帮助更大
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

也能接替去世了的伊蒙学士 帮助大家
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

学城有着这个世界上最大的图书馆
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

我将在那里学习历史
I'll learn about history,

战术 医术
strategy, healing.

还有其他各种知识
And other things,

异鬼们兵临城下的时候
things that will help when

这些知识会有用的
when they come.

如果吉莉留在这里 她必死无疑
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

那个以我为名的孩子也会死
And the baby that she named after me will die.

而我会为了保护她们 也一样死去
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

这意味着 我死前看到的最后画面
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world

是她失望的眼神
will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

相比之下 我宁愿看见成千上万的异鬼
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

谢谢
Thank you.

你要知道 在学城 你也需要发誓不碰女人的
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

得了吧 让他们试试
Oh, they'll bloody try.

山姆 什么
Sam. What?

山姆
Sam.

你不是才被打了个半死么 你是怎么...
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you

哦 我可是挺小心的
Oh, very carefully.

我很欣慰 在这世界的尽头
I'm glad the end of the world's

还是有人过得不错啊
working out well for someone.

我会回来的
I'll come back.

敬你平安归来
To your return.

敬我平安归来
To my return.

My lady!

史坦尼斯
Stannis.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的大军攻过来了
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

你怎么知道是史坦尼斯
How do you know it's Stannis?

他们拿的是烈焰红心旗
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

我在黑水河之战见过 永生难忘
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

在这里挖下战壕
Trench here.

离城墙三百尺的地方再挖一道
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

让他们快点
Hurry them along.

好的 克鲁 我在这儿
Right, Curlew. Yes, sir.

在这两个坡地之间挖一道战壕
Dig between those two rises.

分散队形 我跟你一起
Spread out. I'm with you.

弓箭手准备 分散队形
Archers! Spread out!

快点派征粮队出去
And send out a foraging party immediately.

日出时正式围城
Siege begins at sunrise.

不会有围城战了 陛下
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

我们毫无胜算
We've got no chance!

别 别这样
No, please, please.

原来还有女人给波顿卖命
Bolton has women fighting for him?

我并不为波顿作战
I don't fight for the Boltons.

我是塔斯的布蕾妮
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

蓝礼·拜拉席恩的御林铁卫
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

他被刺杀的那天晚上 我看到了个跟你长得一样的影子
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

你用了血魔法谋害了他？
You murdered him with blood magic?

是的
I did.

以安达尔人、先民的正统国王
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,

七国的统治者
First of His Name,

暨全境守护者
rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

拜拉席恩家族的蓝礼一世之名
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,

我 塔斯的布蕾妮 在此宣判你死刑
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

你有何遗言么
Do you have any last words?

做你该做的吧
Go on, do your duty.

拉姆斯·波顿
卢斯·波顿的私生子

看来已经结束了
Looks like we're done here.

我投降 我投降
I surrender! I surrender!

而我接受你的投降
And I accept your surrender.

我们回城吧
Let's head back.

我妻子该寂寞了
My wife must be lonely.

米兰达
拉姆斯的情妇

夫人
My lady.

“臭佬”
席恩·葛雷乔伊

我奉命送您回您的闺房
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

听她的话吧 求您了
Go with her, please.

我知道拉姆斯是什么东西
I know what Ramsay is.

我知道他接下来要对我干什么
I know what he'll do to me.

就算我必须死
If I'm going to die,

至少我现在还死得像个人
let it happen while there's still some of me left.

死
Die?

有人说过您要死么
Who said anything about dying?

您可不能死啊
You can't die.

您的父亲可是北境守护
Your father was Warden of the North.

拉姆斯还用得着您
Ramsay needs you.

虽然我觉得他大概不需要一个完整的您
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

只需要您能为他生下继承人的那个部分
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

您给他生下一两个男孩以后 就完全没用了
until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

那时候他大概会有些别的好计划吧
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

所以 我们要等他回来呢
So, shall we wait for him to come back

还是现在直接开始
or should we begin now?

您让我自己选择吗
You're leaving it to me?

很好
Good.

那就现在开始吧
Let's begin.

臭佬 停下
Reekstop!

停下
Stop!

打开城门！
Open the gate!

他回来了
He's coming back.

你们俩 出去
You two, out.

“无名之辈”
艾莉亚·史塔克

你在我名单首位 知道么
You were the first person on my list, you know.

因为你杀了西利欧·佛瑞尔 记得他么？
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

恐怕你早就忘了
Probably not.

我还有其他人要杀
I've gotten a few of the others.

但千面之神从我这里偷走了他们
The ManyFaced God stole a few more from me.

不过好在它留下了你
But I'm glad he left me you.

知道我是谁么？
Do you know who I am?

我听不见
I can't hear you.

你知道我是谁

我是艾莉亚·史塔克

“无名之辈”

一点都没准备好
Not at all.

那个人的生命不归你取
That man's life was not yours to take.

女孩从千面之神那里偷走了一条命
A girl stole from the ManyFaced God.

欠下命债
Now a debt is owed.

唯有死亡能偿还生命
Only death can pay for life.

不要！不要！
No! No!

不，你… 你不能死！不能死！
No, youdon't die! Don't die!

你为什么哭泣？
Why are you crying?

他是我朋友
He was my friend.

不 他不是 你为什么不听他话？
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

他是无名之辈
He was no one.

但如果你… 
But if you're

这又是谁？
who's this?

谁也不是
No one at all.

正如从大厅里偷走脸庞的女孩本该成为的
Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.

这些脸属于无名之辈
The faces are for no one.

而你仍是有名之辈
You are still someone.

对有名之辈来说
And to someone,

这些脸是毒药
the faces are as good as poison.

我看不见了
I can't see.

怎么回事？
What's happening?

发生了什么？
What's happening?!

你很幸运
You're lucky.

不政治
so well arranged.

您真这么想？

你母亲什么时候喜欢过别人？
aside from her children?

她喜欢您

这我可不好说
I'm not so sure about that.

听着… 
Listen...

有些事情我想告诉你
there's something I wanted to tell you.

有些我早就该和你说的事情
Something I should have told you long ago.

所以… 
So...

既然你见过世面了
now that you've seen more of the world,

你应该能明白 事情会很复杂
you've learned how complicated things can be,

人也是
people can be.

兰尼斯特家族和马泰尔家族是世仇
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,

但你和崔斯丹相爱了
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

这很意外 真的 我的意思是 这种事情发生的几率多大？
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

你爱上了
You happen to fall in love with the man

你被指定要嫁的未婚夫？
you were assigned to marry?

我的意思是… 
My point is...

我们无法选择会爱上谁
we don't choose whom we love.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
“大熊”  被放逐的骑士

你们爱她 对吧？

How could you not?

这对你俩来说 是多么绝望啊
Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.

角斗场出来的佣兵 被放逐的骑士
A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.

谁都不能当女王的丈夫
Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.

安达尔人乔拉
Jorah the Andal.

弥桑黛
丹妮的侍女

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

托戈·努德霍
Torgo Nudho.

他不应该在这
He should not be here.

是的
No, but he is.

女王放逐了他
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

要不是他 女王早死了
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

是真的 我也差点死了 救我的是这个...

小个子

侏儒

我想是这个词

抱歉

我的瓦雷利亚语不太牛逆

不太流利

谢谢
Thank you.

抱歉
I am sorry.

我没在那里为女王而战
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

你错过了一架
You missed a good scrap.

但没关系了
None of that matters now.

我们在这里说多久
The longer we sit here bantering,

丹妮莉斯就要在荒野里多呆多久
the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

他说得对 龙往北边飞了
He's right. The dragon headed north.

如果要去找她 我们得往那走
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

我们？
We?

你是个兰尼斯特
You're a Lannister.

女王意欲剥夺你们家族的权力
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

而我准备帮她这么干
And I intend to help her do it.

你才来几天？
You've been here for how many days now?

我为她战斗了好几年
I've fought for her for years.

那时她还是个半大的小姑娘
Since she was little more than a child.

你背叛了她 注意言辞
You betrayed her. Careful now.

然后她放逐了你 没记错的话 还放逐了两次
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

第二次还不是你害的
The second time thanks to you.

别拿你自己的罪过责怪我 莫尔蒙
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

他没错 女王放逐了乔拉
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

他也没错 乔拉救了女王一命
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

那或许她现在对他的感觉有所改变
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

又或许没有 只有问问她才知道
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

行 行 我想他现在可以加入我们了
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

只要他保证不会夜里割了我喉咙就行
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

我要杀你也是正大光明地杀
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

不好意思 只不过 我们为什么要带上你呢？
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

什么？
Pardon me?

你在野外追踪过动物吗？
Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

准确来讲 没有 但是我有其他用得着的技巧
Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.

你能战斗吗？
Can you fight?

我打过仗
I have fought.

虽然我不会说自己是一名伟大的战士
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

你的马术好吗？
Are you good on a horse?

中等水平
Middling.

所以说你主要靠嘴皮子
So mainly you talk.

我也酗酒  但是我也活了这么长啊
And drink. I've survived so far.

这倒让人钦佩 但你对这次搜寻没什么帮助
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

不过你可以留在弥林发挥作用
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

我们之中没人管理过一座城市
None of us have experience governing a city

除了这位
except for him.

你不是想向女王证明自己的价值吗？
You want to prove your value to the queen?

在弥林城证明吧
Prove it right here in Meereen.

他是个异域侏儒 而且还说不好本地的语言
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

弥林人凭什么要听他的？
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

他们当然不会
They wouldn't.

但是灰虫子会让他们听话
They will listen to Grey Worm.

我要跟你一起去
I'll come with you.

我会找到我们的女王
I'll find our queen.

你不能乱跑 你还没有恢复好呢  我恢复好了
You are not strong enough to go anywhere. I am.

他恢复了 他是我见过的没有卵蛋的人里最有种的
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

但是你还是不能一起去
But you still can't go.

自由民相信你
The people believe in you.

他们知道你可以代表女王
They know you speak for the queen.

的确
It's true.

只有无垢者才能维持城内秩序
Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

如果你走了的话 城里一半的人会群起而杀掉另一半
If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.

弥桑黛也不能去
And Missandei.

女王陛下最相信的人就是弥桑黛
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

不是我
Certainly not me.

一个是女王最亲密的知心人
The queen's closest confidante,

一个是无垢者的统帅
the commander of the Unsullied,

还有个外国侏儒 脸上有道疤
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

祝你们好运 我的朋友们
Good fortune, my friends.

弥林是座古老而光荣的城市
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

别毁了她
Try not to ruin her.

看来就是我俩了 安达尔人乔拉
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

走 咱们去找两匹好马
Let's find some good horses.

这一路可有的聊了
We have so much to talk about.



你好啊 老友
Hello, old friend.

在你离我而去之前 我认为我们结伴的旅途还是很愉快的啊
I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

我就不问你是怎么找到我的了
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

小小鸟或鸣在西 小小鸟或鸣在东
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,

全看人们是不是会聆听
if one knows how to listen.

他们告诉我你已经获得了
They tell me you've already found favor

龙之母的赏识
with the Mother of Dragons.

至少她没砍掉我的头
Well, she didn't execute me,

这是个好的开头
so that's a promising start.

而现在英雄去救美了
Now the heroes are off to find her

我却不能离开这里
and I'm stuck here

还要尽力安抚一个处在内战边缘的城市
trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

老战友有何建议啊？
Any advice for an old comrade?

情报是关键
Information is the key.

你要弄清楚敌人的势力和策略
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

还要学会区分出你所谓的“朋友”中的敌人
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

要是我认识一个情报网密布的朋友就好咯
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

是啊
If only.

一座伟大的古城
A grand old city

充斥了暴力 腐败和阴谋
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

但谁又有经验去驯服这一个
Who could possibly have any experience

庞大而笨拙的野兽呢？
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

所以我很想念你啊
I did miss you.

好啦 我知道
Oh, I know.

卓耿
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的黑龙

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
“风暴降生” 弥林的女王

我们得回家

疼吗？
Does it hurt?

我们得回家
We have to go home.

卓耿
Drogon.

载我回弥林吧？
Can you take me back to Meereen?

你带我飞了多远？
How far did you carry me?

卓耿 我们得回去
Drogon, we need to return.

我的人民需要我
My people need me.

没有吃的
Well, there's no food.

最起码 你可以给我们捉些猎物当晚饭
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

乌尼亚
修女

认罪
Confess.

认罪
Confess.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
太后

我有罪
I have sinned.

我现在认识到了
I see that now.

我怎么会一直都如此盲目呢？
How can I have been so blind for so long?

我想洗净我的罪恶
I want to be clean again.



我想求得赦免
I want absolution.



老妪高举智慧之灯来到我面前
The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.

通过她的圣光
And by its holy light

你想认罪忏悔？
You wish to make a confession?

如果我认罪 我会重获自由吗？
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

对陛下的处置将会根据陛下的罪行而定
Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

大麻雀
总主教

那么 愿圣母慈悲
The Mother have mercy, then.

我认罪 我在婚姻之外和人同寝
I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.

说出名字
Name him.

Lancel Lannister.

你的表弟 先王的侍从
Your cousin and the king's squire.

我当时孤单又恐惧 你有一个丈夫
I was lonely and afraid. You had a husband.

一个逮到机会就到处留情的丈
A husband off whoring every chance he

他的罪抵消不了你的罪行
His sins do not pardon your own.

七神宽恕我
May the gods forgive me.

有没有其他人？
Other men?

没有
No.

没有了？
No others?

没有
No.

在七神面前说谎是极大的罪恶
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

你明白吗？
You understand this?

是的
I do.

有人说你的孩子们
There are those that say your children

不是你和劳勃国王所生
were not fathered by King Robert,

而是通奸和乱伦产下的私生子
that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

谎言
A lie.

这是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的谎言
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

他图谋篡位 但是他兄长的嫡子挡了他的路
He wants the throne, but his brother's children stand in his way.

所以他才编造谎言说孩子不是他兄长的
So he claims they are not his brother's.

那个卑鄙小人
That filth.

这里面没有一丝一毫的真实可言
There is not one shred of truth to it.

我坚决否认
I deny it.

好
Good.

但这些是骇人听闻的指控
But these are terrible charges.

七大王国的人民必须知道真相
