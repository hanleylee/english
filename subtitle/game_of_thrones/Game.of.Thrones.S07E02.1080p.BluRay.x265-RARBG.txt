根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》 改编
原著  乔治·R·R·马丁

第七季第二集  Stormborn
风暴降生

在这样的夜晚您降临于世
On a night like this, you came into the world.

我记得那场风暴
I remember that storm.

君临城所有的狗
All the dogs in King's Landing

都叫了一整夜
howled through the night.

我要是也能记得就好了
I wish I could remember it.

我之前总是认为这会是回家
I always thought this would be a homecoming.

但这里没有家的感觉
Doesn't feel like home.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
 “风暴降生” 海外的女王

提利昂·兰尼斯特
 女王之手

我们不会在龙石岛待太久
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

很好
Good.

也没几个狮子嘛
Not so many lions.

七大王国里 瑟曦控制的不到一半
Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms.

维斯特洛的领主们都讨厌她
The lords of Westeros despise her.

瓦里斯
 “八爪蜘蛛”

甚至在您登陆前 他们还在密谋推翻她
Even before your arrival, they plotted against her.

而现在… 他们为自己真正的女王呐喊助威？
Now... They cry out for their true queen?

偷偷举杯向我致敬？
They drink secret toasts to my health?

人们曾经给我哥讲过这些事
People used to tell my brother that sort of thing,

而他蠢到连这都信
and he was stupid enough to believe them.

如果韦赛里斯有三头巨龙 一支大军
If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back,

他早就入侵君临了
he'd have invaded King's Landing already.

征服维斯特洛对您来说易如反掌
Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.

但您在这里目的可不是要成为灰烬女王
But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.

没错
No.

拿下七大王国
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

不非得涂炭生灵
without turning it into a slaughterhouse.

如果各大家族拥护您来共同讨伐瑟曦
If the great houses support your claim against Cersei,

这场游戏必赢
the game is won.

提利尔与多恩大军站到了我们这边
With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side,

我们在南境拥有最强大盟友
we have powerful allies in the south.

我还没有向你正式道谢
I never properly thanked you for that.

陛下 他们之所以加入了我们一方
They joined our side, my queen,

是因为他们完全信赖您
because they believe in you.

瓦里斯大人 你侍奉过我的父亲 对吗？
You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?

是的
I did.

之后你侍奉了那个推翻了他的人
And then you served the man who overthrew him.

我确实有选择的机会 陛下
I had a choice, Your Grace

侍奉劳勃·拜拉席恩 或被斧头砍掉脑袋
serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.

但你侍奉了他没多长时间
But you didn't serve him long.

又转而反抗他
You turned against him.

不可否认 劳勃比您父亲更为开明
Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure.

历史上罕有像疯王这样
There have been few rulers in history

残暴的统治者
as cruel as the Mad King.

劳勃既不疯狂也不残暴
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

他只是对当国王没什么兴趣
He simply had no interest in being king.

所以你自告奋勇去找一个更好的
So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.

陛下
Your Grace,

当我打算沉溺饮酒终了此生的时候
when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin,

瓦里斯大人告诉我东方有一位女王… 
Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who

在我掌权之前 你还支持过我的哥哥
Before I came to power, you favored my brother.

你那些间谍 那些小小鸟
All your spies, your little birds,

他们告诉过你韦赛里斯是个残忍愚蠢的废物吗？
did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?

依你所见 这些是成为一名好国王的品质吗？
Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?

陛下 直到您和卓戈卡奥联姻之前
Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

我对您一无所知 我不知道您的存在
I knew nothing about you, save your existence

还有您传说中的美貌
and that you were said to be beautiful.

所以你和你的朋友们就像卖牲口一样把我卖给了多斯拉克人
So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

这也成了您日后的制胜筹码
Which you turned to your advantage.

谁给你下令要杀我？
Who gave the order to kill me?

劳勃国王
King Robert.

谁雇佣了刺客？
Who hired the assassins?

谁将指示送到厄索斯意图谋杀丹妮莉丝·坦格利安？
Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

陛下 我已采取了必要措施以 以保住你的小命？
Your Grace, I did what had to be done toTo keep yourself alive.

瓦里斯大人已经证明了自己是一名忠诚的仆人
Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.

证明了忠诚？恰恰相反
Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite.

如果他厌恶了一位君主 他就会密谋拥护下一位
If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one.

这算什么仆人？
What kind of a servant is that?

国家需要的那种仆人
The kind the realm needs.

无能的君主不值得盲目追随
Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.

只要我还能分辨得出 我就会继续寻找明君
As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.

我没有生在权贵家族
I wasn't born into a great house.

我生来一无所有
I came from nothing.

灰虫子

我被当作奴隶来贩卖 男根被切下来作为祭品
I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.

弥桑黛

我还是个孩子的时候 我在小巷 贫民窟和废屋里苟且求生
When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

您想知道我的忠诚在哪里？
You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?

我的忠诚不属于任何国王或者女王 我的忠诚属于人民
Not with any king or queen, but with the people.

那些在暴政酷压或是清政繁荣下挣扎的人民
The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.

那些衷心祈愿您获胜的人民
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

如果您只要盲目的忠诚
If you demand blind allegiance,

我尊重您的意愿
I respect your wishes.

灰虫子可以将我斩首 您的巨龙可以将我生吞
Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.

但您若放我一命 我将鞠躬尽瘁
But if you let me live, I will serve you well.

我将竭心尽力直到亲眼见到您登临铁王座
I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne

因为我选择了您
because I choose you.

因为我知道除您以外人民别无选择
Because I know the people have no better chance than you.

向我宣誓效忠 瓦里斯
Swear this to me, Varys.

如果你认为我辜负了人民
If you ever think I'm failing the people,

你不会密谋造反
you won't conspire behind my back.

而是像今天这样直视我
You'll look me in the eye as you have done today,

告诉我是如何辜负了人民的
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

我发誓 女王陛下
I swear it, my queen.

我也发誓如果你背叛我
And I swear thisif you ever betray me,

我会把你活活烧死
I'll burn you alive.

我对龙之母别无他求
I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.

启禀陛下
Forgive me, my queen.

一位来自亚夏的红袍女祭司求见
A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.

梅丽珊卓夫人

丹妮莉丝女王陛下

我曾为奴

颠沛流离

鞭打受烙

能面见打碎镣铐之人是我的莫大荣幸

红袍祭司将和平降予弥林

我们欢迎你

怎么称呼？

梅丽珊卓

她曾经侍奉过另一位想夺取铁王座的人
She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的下场可不太好啊
It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

是的
No, it didn't.

你选了个好日子来龙石岛
You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.

我们刚刚原谅了那些
We've just decided to pardon those

侍奉昏君的人
who once served the wrong king.

光之王在维斯特洛没有多少追随者吧？
The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?

暂时是这样 但即使是那些不崇拜光之王的人
Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord

也能为他的大业效力
can serve his cause.

你的光之王想从我这里得到些什么呢？
What does your lord expect from me?

长夜将至

“预言中的王子将会带来曙光”
"The prince who was promised will bring the dawn."

恐怕我并不是一位王子
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

陛下 请原谅
Your Grace, forgive me,

您的理解不够准确
but your translation is not quite accurate.

在高等瓦雷利亚语中这个名词不带阴阳性
That noun has no gender in High Valyrian,

所以这段预言的正确翻译应该是
so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,

“预言中的王子或公主将会带来曙光”
"The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."

说起来不怎么顺口啊
Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?

确实 但我更喜欢这样
No, but I like it better.

你相信这段预言指的是我？
And you believe this prophecy refers to me?

预言是危险的东西
Prophecies are dangerous things.

我相信的是您有自己的使命
I believe you have a role to play.

另一位也是一样
As does another

北境之王 琼恩·雪诺
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

琼恩·雪诺？
Jon Snow?

奈德·史塔克的私生子？ 你认识他？
Ned Stark's bastard? You know him?

他加入守夜人的时候我和他一起去的长城
I travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.

你觉得光之王为什么会选中这个琼恩·雪诺呢？
And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?

我是说 除了你在火焰里看见的那些幻象以外
Aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is.

作为守夜人的总司令
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

他让野人进入了长城以南
he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall

保护他们免受灭顶之灾
to protect them from grave danger.

作为北境之王
As King in the North,

他把野人和北境的各大家族联合起来
he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses,

这样他们能够一起面对共同的敌人
so together they may face their common enemy.

听起来很了不起嘛
He sounds like quite a man.

把琼恩·雪诺叫来吧
Summon Jon Snow.

让他站在您的面前
Let him stand before you

让他告诉您发生在他身上的一切
and tell you the things that have happened to him,

他亲眼所见的种种事情
the things that he has seen with his own eyes.

对于预言和火焰中的幻像
I can't speak to prophecies

我没什么看法
or visions in the flames,

但我喜欢琼恩·雪诺 我相信他
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

我看人很准
And I am an excellent judge of character.

如果他确实控制了北境
If he does rule the North,

那他将成为我们有力的盟友
he would make a valuable ally.

兰尼斯特家族处决了他的父亲
The Lannisters executed his father

并且谋害了他的兄长
and conspired to murder his brother.

琼恩·雪诺甚至比你更有理由痛恨瑟曦
Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.

很好
Very well.

向北方派一只渡鸦
Send a raven north.

告诉琼恩·雪诺 他的女王
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

邀请他前往龙石岛… 
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

并臣服于她
and bend the knee.

集合 都到这里来
Gather round. Come here.

你真觉得是提利昂送来的信？
You think it's really Tyrion?

说不定是别人设的陷阱
It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.

看看最后一句
Read the last bit.

“所有的侏儒在父亲眼里都是私生子”
"All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes."

这是什么意思？
What does that mean?

这是我们第一次见面时他对我说的话
It's something he said to me the first night we met.

珊莎·史塔克

你比我们其他人都更了解他
You know him better than any of us.

琼恩·雪诺
 北境之王

你怎么看？
What do you think?

提利昂跟其他兰尼斯特家的人不一样
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

他对我一直很好 但是这太冒险了
He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.

“只要瑟曦还坐在铁王座上
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

七大王国就会继续血流成河
as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.

加入我们吧
Join us.

只要同心协力 我们就能终结她的暴政”
Together, we can end her tyranny."

戴佛斯·席渥斯
 “洋葱骑士”

听起来还挺有吸引力的
Sounds like a charmer.

当然 他顺便提到了多斯拉克部族
Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde,

一支无垢者军团 还有三条龙
a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons

这就不怎么吸引人了
a bit less charming.

怎么了？
What?

您告诉过我 火焰能杀死尸鬼
Fire kills wights, you told me.

但什么东西能吐出火呢？
What breathes fire?

你该不会真想让琼恩和她会面吧？
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

不 那样太危险了 但是？
No, too dangerous. But?

但是如果亡者大军越过了长城
But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall,

我们有足够的士兵抵挡他们吗？
do we have enough men to fight them?

如果疯王的女儿得到了铁王座
If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne,

我们都清楚 她将会毁灭全境
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

你们之中有些人是提利尔家族的封臣
Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
 铁王座上的女王

但提利尔家族已经公开造反
But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.

靠着他们的帮助 疯王的女儿
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

已经往我们的境内运了一支野蛮人军团
has ferried an army of savages to our shores

无垢者就是些战争机器 会摧毁你们的城堡和要塞
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

而多斯拉克蛮族会把你们的村庄夷为平地
Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground,

强暴奴役你们的女人
rape and enslave your women,

毫不犹豫地屠杀你们的孩子
and butcher your children without a second thought.

这就是奥莲娜·提利尔对于你们几百年来的效忠所作出的回报
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.

你们一定都还记得疯王
You all remember the Mad King.

你们一定都还记得他给人民带来的恐怖
You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
 “弑君者” 御林铁卫队长

他的女儿也会和他一样
His daughter is no different.

在厄斯索斯 她的暴行妇孺皆知
In Essos, her brutality is already legendary.

她把奴隶湾的数百名贵族都钉上了十字架
She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

当她玩腻了这些把戏
And when she grew bored of that,

就拿他们去喂龙
she fed them to her dragons.

保护子民是我神圣的义务 而我也一定会做到
It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will.

但是各位 我需要你们的帮助
But I need your help, my lords.

我们所有人必须团结一致… 
We must stand together, all of us...

才能阻止她
if we hope to stop her.

蓝道·塔利
 角陵伯爵

陛下 她有三条成年巨龙啊
She has three fullgrown dragons, Your Grace.

跟伊耿当年征服七国时
The same as Aegon when he conquered

一模一样
the Seven Kingdoms.

您要怎么抵挡它们呢？
How do you propose to stop them?

科本
 被剥夺项链的学士

大人 我们正在研究对策
We are currently at work on a solution, my lord.

塔利大人
Lord Tarly.

詹姆爵士
Ser Jaime.

您一定认识我的儿子吧
I believe you know my son.

詹姆爵士
Ser Jaime.

瑞卡德 对吧？
Rickard, isn't it?

是狄肯
Dickon.

对了
That's it.

感谢您的到来
Thank you for coming.

河湾地的其他领主都比以前更指望着您的领导呢
The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever.

您要不来 说不定他们都不会来了
They might not have come if you hadn't.

只要女王召见我 我一定会响应
If my queen summons me, I answer the call.

而且我也听说了她是怎么对待那些反对者的
And I've heard what she does to those who defy her.

您今天要回角陵？
You ride for Horn Hill today?

我得调遣军队
I have an army to mobilize.

战争要来了
Won't be long before the fighting starts.

那么您会为哪一方作战呢？
And which side will you be fighting for?

您是唯一曾在战场上打败过劳勃·拜拉席恩的人
You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.

就连雷加·坦格利安也没能做到这一点
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could do that.

回到河湾地可是很长一段路 詹姆爵士 您需要我做什么？
It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

我希望您能在即将到来的战争中担任我的高级将领
I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.

我希望您向瑟曦宣誓效忠
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

我还希望您能帮助我打败她的敌人
and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.

所有敌人
All her enemies.

包括奥莲娜·提利尔
Including Olenna Tyrell.

我是塔利家族一员
I'm a Tarly.

这个名字是有份量的
That name means something.

我们既不是破誓者 也不是阴谋家
We're not oathbreakers. We're not schemers.

我们不会在对手背后捅刀子
We don't stab our rivals in the back

更不会在婚礼上将人割喉
or cut their throats at weddings.

我向提利尔家族盟过誓
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

你也对王室宣过誓 塔利大人
You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly.

我很小就认识奥莲娜了
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

她曾是个卓越的女人
She was a great woman once.

但如今她已经完了
Now she's broken.

她只是迫切想要复仇
She wants revenge so badly,

甚至把多斯拉克人带上了岸
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

这可是维斯特洛史上第一次出现多斯拉克人啊
The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.

我知道你不喜欢我姐姐
I know you don't like my sister,

但是你必须做出选择
but you have to make a choice.

是跟我们并肩作战
Do you fight with us

还是跟外邦蛮族和阉人并肩作战？
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

战争胜利之后
When the war is won,

女王会需要一个新的南境守护
the queen will need a new Warden of the South.

我想不起任何比蓝道·塔利
I can think of no better man

更适合的人选
than Randyll Tarly.

山姆威尔·塔利
 学城学徒

感染扩散的面积太大了
The infection has spread too far.

你应该在被碰到的那一刻就砍断自己的胳膊
You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.

乔拉·莫尔蒙

还有多久？
How long?

安布罗斯
 学城博士

这病杀死你得花上好些年
It'll be years before it kills you.

也许10年
Could be 10.

也许20年
Could be 20.

还有多久会… 
But how long until...?

精神错乱？
Your mind?

六个月 可能更快
Six months, maybe fewer.

呃… 
Um...

请教一下 博士
Pardon, Archmaester.

我在黑城堡见过史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的女儿
I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.

她在婴儿时期患上了灰麟病且被治愈了
She had the greyscale as a baby and was cured.

不 是不是有什么办法
No. Isn't there some way

你看他像个婴儿吗？
Does this look like a baby to you?

不像 那你研究过
No. Have you studied

灰鳞病的恶化速率
the varying rates of greyscale progression

在孩童和成人身上的差异吗？
in infants and fully grown men?

没有
No.

克礼森学士及时发现了
Maester Cressen discovered

席琳·拜拉席恩的病
Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.

而他已病入膏肓
This is quite advanced.

恕我们无能为力 爵士
And beyond our skills, ser.

若你只是个平民 我会立马将你遣送至瓦雷利亚
Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once

与石民共度余生
to live out your life with the stone men.

但你是个受封的骑士 我会多宽限你一天
As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.

如何度过这点时间取决于你
How you choose to spend that time is up to you.

走吧 山姆威尔
Come, Samwell.

需要我们给您的家人传话吗 爵士？
Should we send word to your family, Ser...?

乔拉
Jorah.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
Jorah Mormont.

莫尔蒙？
Mormont?

没必要了
There's no need.

对他们来说我都死了好多年了
I've been dead to them for years.

走了 山姆威尔！
Come, Samwell!

陛下 您下来过这里吗？
Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?

没有 该是没来过
No, I can't say I have.

自从劳勃把这些东西从王座厅移出来我就再没见过了
I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the throne room.

很奇怪劳勃国王竟没有销毁它们
Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.

这些都是他的战利品
They were his trophies.

他不能摆在自己周围
He couldn't keep them around.

它们会让他显得渺小
They would have made him look small.

他有时会下来瞧瞧它们
Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.

我敢说他偶尔也把他的婊子带过来
I believe he brought his whores on occasion.

“黑死神”贝勒里恩
Balerion the Dread.

伊耿骑着这只野兽飞过大海
The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.

他的火焰锻造了铁王座
His flames forged the Iron Throne

使七王国俯首帖耳
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

十分强大… 
Powerful...

但却不是坚不可摧
but not invincible.

实际上 丹妮莉丝的一头龙
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

在弥林的竞技场上被长矛刺伤了
was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.

如果他们能被刺伤
And if they can be wounded,

他们也能被杀掉
they can be killed.

这是君临城里最好的制弩师傅和铁匠
The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing

夜以继日赶工出来的 女王陛下
have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.

您可以试着拉下那个操纵杆
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

如果你想要铁王座 就去拿吧
If you want the Iron Throne, take it.

亚拉·葛雷乔伊

我们有一支军队 一支舰队 还有三头龙
We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.

我们现在就应该动用全部兵力全力攻打君临城
We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.

君临城会在一天之内沦陷
The city will fall within a day.

如果把龙放了 成千上万的人将死于火焰之中
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

这就是战争
It's called war.

艾拉莉亚·沙德
 “红毒蛇”的情妇

你没有这个胃口 就赶紧跑回去躲起来
You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.

我知道你们是怎么发动战争的
I know how you wage war.

在这里我们不会毒害小女孩
We don't poison little girls here.

弥塞菈是无辜的
Myrcella was innocent.

她是兰尼斯特家族的一员
She was a Lannister.

兰尼斯特家族没有无辜的人
There are no innocent Lannisters.

我最后悔的事情就是让奥柏伦为你战死
My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.

够了
That's enough.

提利昂大人是女王之手
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

请你对他放尊重点
You will treat him with respect.

我来这里不是为了做“灰烬”女王的
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

说得真好听
That's very nice to hear.

奥莲娜夫人
 “荆棘女王”

当然了 我记不起有哪个女王
Of course, I can't remember a queen

比我的孙女更受爱戴
who was better loved than my granddaughter.

百姓们爱戴她
The common people loved her.

贵族们也爱戴她
The nobles loved her.

可现在她剩下了什么呢？
And what is left of her now?

灰烬
Ashes.

百姓也好 贵族也好
Commoners, nobles,

他们真的就只是孩子而已
they're all just children, really.

除非他们怕你 否则就不会服从你
They won't obey you unless they fear you.

我很感激您的谏言 奥莲娜夫人
I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.

我很感激在场的所有人
I'm grateful to all of you.

但是你们已经选择了追随我
But you have chosen to follow me.

我不会进攻君临城
I will not attack King's Landing.

我们不会进攻君临城
We will not attack King's Landing.

那你打算怎样夺回铁王座？
Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?

规规矩矩地请求吗？
By asking nicely?

我们将包围君临城
We will lay siege to the capital,

从各个方向围住
surrounding the city on all sides.

瑟曦拥有铁王座
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

但她的军队和人民都没有粮食供给
but no food for her army or the people.

我们不会派多斯拉克人和无垢者
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

瑟曦将会利用他们的忠诚
Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros

他们的爱国之心
by appealing to their loyalty,

尝试与维斯特洛的诸侯结盟
their love for their country.

如果我们用外族战士包围都城
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

就正中她的下怀了
we prove her point.

我们的军队必须是维斯特洛人
Our army should be Westerosi.

我猜 维斯特洛人就是指我们咯？
And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?

席恩·葛雷乔伊

没错
You are.

葛雷乔伊女士将护送你回到阳戟城
Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.

她的铁舰队将运送多恩军队
And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army

从背后袭击君临
back up to King's Landing.

多恩军队将和提利尔军队一起围攻君临
The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.

两大王国联手对抗瑟曦
Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.

所以 你的宏伟计划就是派我们的军队前去进攻
So, your master plan is to use our armies.

恕我直言 为什么不派你们的人上？
Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?

无垢者另有任务
The Unsullied will have another objective.

几十年来 维斯特洛的实权被兰尼斯特家族掌握
For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.

而他们的权力中心是凯岩城
And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.

灰虫子和无垢者
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

将从海路进攻凯岩城 一举夺下
will sail for the Rock and take it.

你们赞同我的计划吗？
Do I have your support?

铁民愿与您联手
You have mine.

多恩愿与您联手 陛下
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

感谢诸位
Thank you all.

奥莲娜夫人 我们可以单独聊一下吗
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

我明白您是出于对瑟曦的仇恨才愿与我联手 您并不喜欢我
I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.

但我对您发誓 她必将为她所做之事付出代价
But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.

维斯特洛将重归和平
And we will bring peace back to Westeros.

和平？
Peace?

您认为您父亲曾为我们带来和平？
Do you think that's what we had under your father?

或者您的祖父？曾祖父？
Or his father? Or his?

和平总是转瞬即逝 亲爱的
Peace never lasts, my dear.

您愿意听取一位老妇人的一点建议吗？
Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?

您的国王之手 他是有智慧的人
He's a clever man, your Hand.

我见识过许多聪明人
I've known a great many clever men.

他们都没我活得久
I've outlived them all.

你知道为什么吗？
You know why?

我从不把他们放在眼里
I ignored them.

维斯特洛的领主都是绵羊
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

您是绵羊吗？
Are you a sheep?

不是
No.

您是龙
You're a dragon.

那就做一条龙
Be a dragon.

进来
Mají.

你明天就出发了
You leave tomorrow.

不打算跟我告个别吗？
Were you going to say goodbye?

等我回来 我们就会再见面
I will see you when I return.

但谁知道那会是什么时候
But you don't know when that will be.

谁都不知道
No one knows.

愿你好运
I wish you good fortune.

弥桑黛
Missandei.

我不知该如何跟你告别
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

为什么？
Why?

你知道原因
You know why.

我不知道
I don't.

你… 你是我的软肋
Yyou are my weakness.

仅此而已？
That's what I am?

你的软肋？
Your weakness?

在无垢者年幼的时候 伟主们便会了解他们的软肋
When Unsullied are young, the masters learn their fears.

有的怕狗
One boy is scared of dogs,

有的恐高
one boy hates high places,

有的畏惧海洋
one is frightened of the ocean.

伟主就让他们和狗一起睡
They make the boy sleep with dogs

爬悬崖
or climb a cliff.

扔水里
They throw him in the water.

如果他学会了游泳 很好
If he learns to swim, good.

如果他淹死了 也很好
If he drowns, good.

无论怎样 无垢者的队伍都会变得更强大
Either way, strong Unsullied.

但是我从没有软肋
But I had no fears.

我不是最高的 也不是最壮的
I was never the biggest, never the strongest...

但我一直都是最无所畏惧的
but I was bravest, always.

我相信这一点 直到… 
I believe it. Until...

直到我在千面屿遇见了弥桑黛
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

我就有了软肋
Now I have fear.

我也是
I do, too.

不要
No.

让我看看你
I want to see you.

让我看看你
Please.

这本也许用得着
Might be useful.

奇维亚桑是个糟糕的作家
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,

但他搞研究很有一套
but an excellent researcher.

博士，请问我能不能…  还有这本
Archmaester, I wondered if IAnd this one.

法乌尔学士就完全不一样了… 
Maester Faull was quite the opposite

他文采出众 讲的东西有一半都是自己编的
a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.

呃 请问… 
Um, I wanted to ask you

塔利 如果你想写史书的话
If you're going to write histories, Tarly,

一定要做研究
you have to do the research.

受欢迎的史书
If you want people to read your histories,

得有点自己的风格
you need a bit of style.

《劳勃一世国王驾崩后战争编年史》不是我写的
I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I"

所以它在书架上无人问津
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

怎么？你不喜欢这个书名？
What? You don't like the title?

换做你会怎么起？
What would you call it, then?

嗯 或许更有诗意点？
Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?

我们可不是诗人 塔利
We're not poets, Tarly.

呃 博士 我可以说两句吗
Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.

你现在就可以说
This is your moment.

最好说点有用的
Use it wisely.

我似乎找到了治疗乔拉爵士的方法
I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.

之前曾有过两则灰鳞病晚期被治愈的病例
There are two recorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured.

我在派洛斯博士的《罕见疾病研究》里面找到了疗法
I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by Archmaester Pylos.

我知道派洛斯博士
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos

还有他的《罕见疾病研究》
and his study of rare diseases.

哦 真的吗 是的
Oh, you are? Yes.

你想知道他怎么死的吗
And shall I tell you how he died?

灰鳞病
From greyscale.

哦 治疗方法太危险了
Oh. The procedure's far too dangerous,

所以那种疗法现在被禁止了
which is why it's now forbidden.

你好
Hello.

你要干什么？
What are you doing?

你是乔拉·莫尔蒙
You're Jorah Mormont,

杰奥·莫尔蒙的独子
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

我是山姆威尔·塔利
My name is Samwell Tarly,

守夜人的弟兄
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,

在此受训 准备担任黑城堡的学士
training to serve as maester at Castle Black.

我认识你父亲
I knew your father.

他去世时我在他身边
I was with him when he died.

你死期未到 乔拉爵士
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

喝掉它
Drink this.

这是什么 朗姆酒
What is it? Rum.

请全都喝掉 可能会很疼
Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

请脱掉上衣
If you could take off your shirt.

如果您不介意的话 麻烦咬紧牙关
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

不好意思 因为没有人知道我在这儿
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

如果有人听见你大喊大叫 我们都得完蛋
and if they hear you screaming, then we're both finished.

你之前做过这种手术吗？
Have you ever done this before?

没有
No.

不过也没人敢做 所以您只能指望我了
But no one else will try it, so I'm the best you've got.

请坐下
Have a seat.

我会把附着在皮肤表面的感染组织都切除
I'm going to have to remove the entire upper layer of infected tissue,

然后把药膏敷在… 
then apply a medicinal ointment to the...

嘘 嘘！
Shh, shh!

小声点
Shh.

再说一次 抱歉
Again, I'm sorry,

但拜托您尽量别叫
but please try not to scream.

听说她的龙比伊耿的还大
They say her dragons are bigger than Aegon's.

瞎扯 瑟曦不过想吓唬人罢了
Horseshit. Cersei's just trying to frighten us.

我倒希望是真的
I hope it's true.

她要是围攻君临城 价格能翻三倍
If she lays siege to King's Landing, prices will triple.

艾莉亚·史塔克

只要咱们能在开战前赶到那儿
As long as we get back there before they start.

再来一杯 我们可要长途跋涉了
One more round. It's a long ride.

阿利！
Arry!

你好 热派
Hello, Hot Pie.

请坐
Sit down.

这是给谁的？
Who's that for?

嗯 真好吃
Mm. This is good.

你真觉得好吃？
You think so?

秘诀是揉面团之前就把黄油煮成焦黄的
The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.

一般人都不这么弄 因为太花功夫了
Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.

嗯 我从来不这么弄
Mm, I didn't do that.

你也烤过派？
You've been making pies?

一两次吧
One or two.

我真不敢相信你会在这
I can't believe you're here.

你碰到过那个大块头女士了吗？
Did you meet the big lady?

大块头？是个女骑士
Big lady? The lady knight?

那个 我觉得她是个骑士因为她穿着盔甲
You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.

她在找你姐姐 不过我跟她提到了你
She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.

她后来找到你了吗？
Did she ever find you?

找到了
She found me.

你出什么事了 阿利？
What happened to you, Arry?

你那有麦芽酒吗？
You got any ale?

你现在往哪去？ 君临城
Where you heading? King's Landing.

去干嘛？ 听说瑟曦当女王了
Why? Heard Cersei's queen now.

听说她炸了大圣堂
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

那场景肯定很壮观
That must have been something to see.

砰 嗯
Boom. Mm.

我真想不到有人会做出这种事
I can't believe someone would do that.

瑟曦就干得出来
Cersei would do that.

我还以为你要去临冬城
I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

去那儿干嘛？那已经是波顿家的了
Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.

没有 波顿家的人都死了
No, the Boltons are dead.

什么？
What?

琼恩·雪诺率领野人军队从黑城堡南下
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a wildling army

他赢了私生子之战
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

现在是北境之王了
He's King of the North now.

你在撒谎
You're lying.

为什么我会说谎？
Why would I lie about that?

他是你哥哥 对吧？
He's your brother, right?

谢谢款待
Thanks for the pie.

朋友免单
Friends don't pay.

真不敢相信 我以前还以为你是个男孩
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

你挺好看
You're pretty.

谢谢
Thanks.

照顾好自己 热派
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

尽量保命
Try not to get killed.

那是当然
Ah, I won't.

我和你一样 阿利
I'm like you, Arry.

命大着呢
I'm a survivor.

离君临城还有两百里
200 miles to King's Landing.

一壶朗姆酒 你觉得够喝吗？
One bottle of rum. You think we'll make it?

请进
Come in.

陛下 从学城来的渡鸦
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

这是山姆威尔·塔利寄给我的信
This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly.

做守夜人时 他与我情同手足
He was my brother at the Night's Watch,

世上我最为信赖之人
a man I trust as much as anyone in this world.

他已找到证据证明
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone

龙石岛耸立的山岩上遍布龙晶
sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

我还于数天前收到了
I received this a few days ago

龙石岛的来信
from Dragonstone.

是提利昂·兰尼斯特寄给我的
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

他现任丹妮莉丝·坦格利安女王的御前首相
He is now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.

她意图从瑟曦·手中夺回铁王座
She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.

培提尔·贝里席
 “小指头”

她强兵在握
She has a powerful army at her back

此外 如果这封信内容属实
and, if this message is to be believed,

她还有三条巨龙
three dragons.

提利昂大人邀我前往龙石岛
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone

与丹妮莉丝会面
to meet with Daenerys.

我已同意
And I'm going to accept.

您同意了？
Accept?!

领主们 我们需要这些龙晶！
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

我们都明白唯有龙晶
We know that dragonglass can destroy

能杀死异鬼和他们的大军
both white walkers and their army.

我们应开采龙晶并制成武器
We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.

但更重要的一点 我们需要盟友！
But more importantly, we need allies!

夜王的军队日益壮大
The Night King's army grows larger by the day.

仅凭自己我们恐难战胜
We can't defeat them on our own.

我们寡不敌众
We don't have the numbers.

丹妮莉丝拥有庞大军队 和龙焰
Daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire.

我将竭力说服她与我们并肩作战
I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.

戴佛斯爵士与我将明日启程 赶往白港
Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow,

然后渡去龙石岛
then sail for Dragonstone.

你难道忘了我们祖父的遭遇？
Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?

疯王邀他去君临城
The Mad King invited him to King's Landing

然后活生生将他烧死 我知道
and roasted him alive. I know that.

她来此是要夺回铁王座与七大王国
She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

北境也是七大王国之一
The North is one of those seven kingdoms.

这不是个邀请 这是个陷阱
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

确有这种可能 但我不信提利昂会做这种事
It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.

你了解他 他是个好人
You know him. He's a good man.

陛下 恕我冒昧 我同意珊莎小姐
Your Grace, with respect, I must agree with Lady Sansa.

疯王的暴行我仍记忆犹新
I remember the Mad King all too well.

约恩·罗伊斯
 “青铜”

坦格利安家族不能信任
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

兰尼斯特家的人也一样 对！
Nor can a Lannister. Yeah!

对 我们向您的兄长称臣
Aye. We called your brother king.

然后他挥兵南下 痛失国土
And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.

罗贝特·葛洛佛
 深林堡伯爵

凛冬已至 陛下
Winter is here, Your Grace.

我们需要北境之王镇守北境
We need the King in the North in the North.

莱安娜·莫尔蒙
 熊岛伯爵夫人

对！
Aye!

你们拥我为王
You all crowned me your king.

我从未想过称王
I never wanted it.

我也从未要求过称王
I never asked for it.

但我接受了 因为北境是我的故土
But I accepted it because the North is my home.

它是我的一部分 我会一直为它战斗
It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it,

不论机会多渺茫
no matter the odds.

但是情况于我们很不利
But the odds are against us.

你们没人见过异鬼的军队 没有一个人见过
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you.

我们绝不可能寄希望于孤军奋战
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

我们需要同盟 强大的同盟
We need allies, powerful allies.

我知道这有风险
I know it's a risk.

但是我不得不冒这个险
But I have to take it.

那就派个使者 不要自己去
Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.

丹妮莉丝是女王
Daenerys is a queen.

只有北境之王才能说服她来帮我们
Only a king can convince her to help us.

必须是我去
It has to be me.

你这是弃你的臣民于不顾
You're abandoning your people!

弃你的家于不顾
You're abandoning your home.

我会把他们交给值得信赖的人
I'm leaving both in good hands.

谁？ 你
Whose? Yours.

你是我妹妹
You are my sister.

你是临冬城唯一的史塔克
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

在我回来之前 北境是你的
Until I return, the North is yours.

我亲自把他的遗骨送回来
I delivered his bones myself.

呈给凯瑟琳夫人
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

替提利昂·兰尼斯特示好
as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.

真是恍如隔世
Seems like a lifetime ago.

等见到提利昂大人的时候 请一定代我向他问好
Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.

他死时我很难过
I was sorry when he died.

你父亲和我有矛盾 但是他很爱凯特
Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.

我也是
So did I.

她不喜欢你 对吧
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

唉 看起来她真是大大低估了你
Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.

你的父亲和兄弟都死了
Your father and brothers are gone,

然而你还在 成了北境之王
yet here you stand, King in the North.

是暴雨袭来时的最大希望
Last best hope against the coming storm.

你不属于这里
You don't belong down here.

原谅我
Forgive me.

我们从来没有好好地说过话
We haven't ever talked... properly.

我想弥补
I wanted to remedy that.

我跟你无话可说
I have nothing to say to you.

连一句“谢谢”也不说吗
Not even "thank you"?

要不是我 你早就命丧战场了
If it weren't for me, you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield.

你有许多敌人 陛下 但是我向你起誓 我不是
You have many enemies, my king, but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.

我爱珊莎
I love Sansa,

正如我爱她母亲一样
as I loved her mother.

敢碰我妹妹 我亲手弄死你
Touch my sister, and I'll kill you myself.

准备好了吗？ 有完没啊？
Ready? Ready?

好了
Ready!

过来
Come on.

是 走吧
Yah! Come on!

娜梅莉亚？
Nymeria?

娜梅莉亚 是我 艾莉亚
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

我在往北去 姑娘
I'm heading north, girl.

回临冬城 我终于要回家了
Back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home.

跟我走吧
Come with me.

跟着我
Come with me.

那不是你
That's not you.

你不能独占他们所有人 这不公平
You can't have them all. It's not fair.

我年纪最长
I'm oldest.

妈妈会想要瑟曦
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

她又不是我妈妈
She's not my mama.

瑟曦可以给你
You can have Cersei.

我要魔山
I want the Mountain.

娜梅莉亚·沙德

魔山杀了父亲
The Mountain killed Father.

奥巴拉·沙德

他一只手就能碾碎你
He'll crush you with one hand.

是父亲太大意了 妈妈就是这么说的
Father got careless. That's what Mama says.

特蕾妮·沙德

你能别一口一个妈妈了吗？
Will you shut up about Mama?

”妈妈 妈妈 妈妈“
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

说不定我在到君临城之前就把你俩都杀了
Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.

这样我就不用和人分享了
And then I won't have to share.

”妈妈！“
"Mama!"

这马尿也能喝？
How can you drink this piss?

等到了阳戟城
When we reach Sunspear,

我请你喝多恩红
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

全世界最美的酒
The best in the world.

你去过多恩吗
Have you ever been to Dorne?

去过几次
A few times.

没久留过
Never stayed long.

一个港口一个男人？
A boy in every port?

有时是男人 有时是女人
A boy, a girl.

看是哪里的港口了
Depends on the port.

能给我们再来点酒吗？
Could we get some more?

我以为你不喜欢喝
I thought it wasn't for you.

我开始尝出味儿来了
I'm developing a taste for it.

他不是你的仆人 没关系
He's not your servant. It's fine.

所以 你会是铁群岛的女王了
So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.

只要我杀了我叔叔
Once I kill my uncle.

那你呢 帅哥
And what will you be, handsome?

我听命于女王
Whatever my queen commands.

他会是我的顾问 我的守卫
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

噢 我懂了
Oh, I see.

你的守卫
Your protector.

就是说 如果有人靠你太近
So, if someone gets too close to you...

他可能要来干涉
He might have to intervene.

把那人拦下
To hold that person back.

直到来者说明来意
Until they've made their intentions known.

那你还在那儿傻站着干什么
Why are you standing all the way over there, then?

外来入侵要开始了哦
A foreign invasion is underway.

别闹他
Leave him be.

看起来你并不需要什么守卫啊
Seems like you don't need a protector.

待在这儿
Stay here.

我们被袭击了
We're under attack!

是攸伦
Euron.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊
 “鸦眼” 铁群岛之王

你母亲在甲板下面 护她周全
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

啊
Aah!

呀
Yah!

呃啊
Aah!

呀
Yah!

呃呀
Yah!

杀了我们吧
Kill us.

给个痛快
Get it over with.

来亲亲叔叔
Give your uncle a kiss.

小席恩
Little Theon!

哈 来吧 你这个没种的懦夫
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

她在我手上
I have her.

来救她呀
Come and get her.

我生来就是七国的统治者
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

我一定会做到
And I will.

战争已经开始 我已经流了血
The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.

瑟曦会严阵以待
Cersei will be ready.

他们知道我们要来了
They know we're coming
