桑铎・克里冈
“猎狗”

走 撤！ 北境之王！
Go, move out! The King in the North!

北境之王！
The King in the North!

北境之王！北境之王！
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境之王！北境之王！
The King in the North! The King in the North!

罗柏・史塔克

艾莉亚・史塔克

北境之王驾到！
Here comes the King in the North!

北境之王驾到！
Here comes the King in the North!

北境之王！北境之王！
The King in the North! The King in the North!

北境… 
Here comes...

哈哈
Hmm.

艾尔德瑞克・萨斯菲尔德爵士和戴斯蒙・克雷赫大人
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

雪伊
珊莎的侍女 小恶魔的情人

艾尔德瑞克・萨斯菲尔德爵士和戴斯蒙・克雷赫大人
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔” 财政大臣

你怎么了？
What are you doing?

我有个清单
I have a list.

杀人清单？
A list of people you mean to kill?

珊莎・史塔克
提利昂的夫人

就因为他们嘲笑我？
For laughing at me?

在你眼中我和乔佛里没两样是吗？
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

不 杀人这种做法是有点极端
No, death seems a bit extreme.

应该说是 死亡带来的恐惧…
Fear of death, on the other hand...

你该学会视而不见
You should learn to ignore them.

夫人 人们嘲笑我
My lady, people have been laughing at me

要比嘲笑你久远多了
far longer than they've been laughing at you.

我是半人
I'm the Halfman,

小魔猴 小恶魔
the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

你是兰尼斯特家的人
You're a Lannister.

而我却是叛徒奈德・史塔克的女儿
I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.

叛徒的女儿和小魔猴
The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.

我们真是天生一对
We're perfect for each other.

那我们该怎么教训他们？
So how should we punish them?

谁？谁要教训谁？
Who? Whom?

艾尔德瑞克・萨斯菲尔德爵士和戴斯蒙・克雷赫大人
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

啊
Ah.

我可以和瓦里斯大人谈谈 打听一下他们有什么变态嗜好
I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.

取名叫“戴斯蒙・克雷赫”的人一定是个变态
Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

我听说你就是个变态
I hear that you're a pervert.

我是小恶魔
I am the Imp.

我有自己的一套规矩
I have certain standards to maintain.

我们可以拿戴斯蒙大人的床玩塞羊进去的把戏
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.

在他的床垫上开一个洞
You cut a little hole in his mattress

把羊粪塞进去
and you stuff sheep dung inside.

然后把洞缝好 把床重新整理好
Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.

他的房间会很臭 而他找不到臭味是从哪儿来的
His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.

珊莎夫人！
Lady Sansa!

我妹妹跟我闹别扭时就这么整过我
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.

她经常跟我闹别扭
And she was always angry with me.

为什么叫“塞羊”？
Why sheep shift?

大粪听起来太粗俗了
That's the vulgar word for dung.

夫人呐… 
My lady...

是你问我的
Well, you asked me.

哦！
Oh!

是他！
That's him!

大人 夫人
My lord, my lady.

波德瑞克・派恩
提利昂的侍从


令尊传您去参加御前会议
Your father has called a meeting of the small council.

今天又杀了几只小狗仔？
Killed a few puppies today?

给他看
Show him.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

快 给他看
Come on, show him.

派席尔
大学士

哦 抱歉 大人
Oh, apologies, my lord.

老了 手指不听使唤
Old fingers.

“萝丝琳套住一条肥美鳟鱼
"Roslin caught a fine fat trout.

她的兄弟们为婚礼献上两张狼皮为礼
Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.

署名 瓦德・佛雷”
Signed Walder Frey."

这文掉得还真蹩脚呢
Is that bad poetry

到底是什么意思？
or is it supposed to mean something?

罗柏・史塔克死啦！
Robb Stark is dead.

他的贱人老娘也死啦！
And his bitch mother.

快回信给瓦德大人
Write back to Lord Frey.

感谢他的效力 命令他
Thank him for his service and command him

送回罗柏・史塔克的人头
to send Robb Stark's head.

等我结婚时 要亲手把这个交给珊莎
I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.

陛下 珊莎夫人可是您舅妈
Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛” 情报总管

小乔在开玩笑 他不是认真的
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

我当然是认真的
Yes, I did.

等我结婚时 要亲手把这个交给珊莎
I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.

不行
No.

你休想再折磨她
She is no longer yours to torment.

我想整谁就整谁
Everyone is mine to torment.

你给我记住 小怪物
You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.

哦 我是怪物
Oh, I'm a monster.

那你更应该对我礼貌些
Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.

怪物可是很危险的
Monsters are dangerous

而且这世道 杀个国王跟摁死只苍蝇差不多
and just now kings are dying like flies.

如此口出狂言
I could have your tongue out

我要拔了你的舌头
for saying that.

就让他威胁吧
Let him make his threats.

哼 他不过是个满腹牢骚的小可怜虫罢了
Hmm? He's a bitter little man.

提利昂大人应该立即道歉
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

让人忍无可忍 目无尊长
Unacceptable, disrespectful,

而且非常低俗
and in very bad taste.

我是国王！
I am the king!

我要惩罚你
I will punish you.

任何大声声明“我是国王”的人
Any man who must say, "I am the king"

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

根本当不了真正的王者
is no true king.

等我替你赢下这场战争
I'll make sure you understand that

我会教你明白这一点的
when I've won your war for you.

我的父亲才赢下了真正的战争
My father won the real war.

他亲手杀掉雷加王子 赢得王冠
He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown

而这时候呢 你却躲在凯岩城里不敢出来
while you hid under Casterly Rock!

国王累了
The king is tired.

护送他回房
See him to his chambers.

来吧 我不累
Come along. I'm not tired.

我们有很多值得庆贺的事
We have so much to celebrate.

还有一场婚礼要策划 你必须休息了
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

大学士 也许弄点安眠酒
Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade

以帮助他入睡
to help him sleep.

我不累！
I'm not tired!

来吧
Come.

你留下
Not you.

你刚把维斯特洛最有权势的人
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros

空着肚子送上床
to bed without his supper.

如果你认为他是维斯特洛最有权势的人 你就是个傻瓜
You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.

叛国言论 乔佛里可是国王
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.

你真认为王冠能带来权力？
You really think a crown gives you power?

不
No.

我认为军队才能带来权力
I think armies give you power.

嗯 罗柏・史塔克有支军队
Mmhmm. Robb Stark had one,

从没输过一场战役
never lost a battle,

还不是被你给打败了
and you defeated him all the same.

嗯 哦 我知道了
Mmhmm. Oh, I know.

我猜 这次瓦德・佛雷是非功过
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

一肩挑了
Or the blame, I suppose,

就看你是否支持他
depending on your allegiance.

瓦德・佛雷这人个性很复杂
Walder Frey is many things,

但要说他勇敢？
but a brave man?

算不上
No.

若非别人作出承诺
He never would have risked such an action

谅他没胆子单独行动
if he didn't have certain assurances.

我给了他承诺
Which he got from me.

你有意见吗？
Do you disapprove?

兵不厌诈 这就是战争
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

但在婚宴上大开杀戒… 
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

我倒是不明白
Explain to me why it is more noble

在战场上屠杀一万士兵
to kill 10,000 men in battle

与在餐桌边干掉十来个人相比 前者有何高尚之处
than a dozen at dinner.

所以您这么干？
So that's why you did it?

为了拯救苍生？
To save lives?

为了结束战争 为了保护族人
To end the war. To protect the family.

你想为死去的史塔克一族写首歌吗？
Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?

写啊
Go ahead, write one.

我在这世上保卫兰尼斯特家族 保护亲人
I'm in this world a little while longer

的时间比你长些
to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

北方人绝不会忘了这事
The northerners will never forget.

很好
Good.

等他们向南方行军时
Let them remember what happens

务必记得这一切
when they march on the south.

史塔克家族的人都死了
All the Stark men are dead.

临冬城成了废墟
Winterfell is a ruin.

卢斯・波顿将被册封为北境守护
Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North

直到你和珊莎的儿子长大成人
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

那方面你还得加把劲
I believe you still have some work to do on that score.

那您觉得珊莎会乖乖配合吗？
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

在我告诉她我们谋杀了她的母亲和哥哥之后?
after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?

不管怎样 你得让那姑娘怀孕
One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.

我不会强暴她
I will not rape her.

要我简短地给你上一课 教你如何看清这世道吗？
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?

劳烦您说简单点 我可没您聪明
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

将家人放在首位的家族
The house that puts family first will always defeat

总会击败那些
the house that puts the whims and wishes

任由子女胡作非为的家族
of its sons and daughters first.

一个称职的人会竭尽所能
A good man does everything in his power

为亲人谋福祉
to better his family's position

而非出于个人私欲
regardless of his own selfish desires.

你觉得好笑吗？
Does that amuse you?

不 这是很好的一课
No, it's a very good lesson.

这个家是由您一个人说了算的
Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family

您当然希望每个人都一心一意服务于这个家
when you're making all the decisions.

我希望？
Easy for me, is it?

您什么时候做事不是出于个人私欲
When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest

什么时候又是纯为了家人的利益着想？
but solely for the benefit of the family?

你出生的那一天
The day that you were born.

我想把你扔进海里
I wanted to carry you into the sea

让海浪把你冲走
and let the waves wash you away.

但我却让你活了下来
Instead, I let you live.

作为儿子养大
And I brought you as my son.

因为你还算是个兰尼斯特
Because you're a Lannister.

珊莎
Sansa.

梅拉・黎德

夏天
布兰・史塔克的冰原狼

里面没人
It's empty.

我们找个地方睡觉
Let's find a place to sleep.

玖健・黎德
拥有绿之视野的男孩

阿多
临冬城的马僮

阿多
Hodor.

阿多
Hodor.

别这样 阿多
Don't, Hodor.

布兰・史塔克
异形者

也许我们不该待在这儿
Maybe we shouldn't stay.

你情愿待在外面？
You'd rather be out there?

关于这地方 流传着很多故事
There are a lot of stories about this place.

恐怖的故事
Horrible stories.

我总喜欢听恐怖故事
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

我也是
So did I.

从前
Once.

你听过鼠厨师的故事吗？
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

没有 他是谁
No. Who's he?

他只是守夜人中的一名厨师
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

他因为什么事生国王的气
He was angry at the king for something,

我不记得了
I don't remember.

国王访问长夜堡时
When the king was visiting the Nightfort,

厨师杀死了国王的儿子
the cook killed the king's son,

和洋葱 胡萝卜 蘑菇 培根一起
cooked him into a big pie

做成了一个大馅饼
with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.

那天夜里他将馅饼呈给国王
That night he served the pie to the king.

国王津津有味地吃着自己亲儿子的肉
He liked the taste of his son so much,

并叫厨师再来一块
he asked for a second slice.

后来 诸神把厨师变成一只巨大的白老鼠
The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat

只能吃自己的小孩
who could only eat his own young.

从此以后 他就在长夜堡内游荡
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since,

吞食子孙
devouring his own babies.

但无论如何
But no matter what he does,

饥饿感却永远无法满足
he's always hungry.

要是诸神把所有的杀人犯
If the gods turned every killer

都变成大白老鼠…
into a giant white rat

诸神不是因为谋杀而诅咒鼠厨师
It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook

也不是因为给国王吃自己儿子做的馅饼
or for serving the king's son in a pie.

但是杀害自家屋檐下的宾客
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

践踏宾客权利 诸神绝不原谅
That's something the gods can't forgive.

瓦德・佛雷
孪河城侯爵

老徒利曾经称呼我“迟到的瓦德・佛雷”
"The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me

因为我没有及时出兵到三叉戟河
because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.

他自以为精明
He thought he was witty.

而如今呢 老徒利
Look at us now, Tully.

你已经死了 你女儿也死了
You're dead, your daughter's dead,

你的外孙也死了
your grandson's dead,

你儿子在地牢里度过了新婚之夜
your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon

而我 成了奔流城公爵
and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

“黑鱼”逃走了
The Blackfish escaped.

不过是个流亡的老头子
An old man on the run

孤立无援
with no allies.

我有泰温・兰尼斯特撑腰
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.

他还有谁？ 言之有理
Who does he have? As you say.

他们都嘲笑我
They all laughed at me,

那些个高高在上的领主们
all those high lords.

一个个都自以为比我强
They all thought they were better than me.

奈德・史塔克 霍斯特・徒利
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

我娶个年轻姑娘他们也笑话
People snigger when I marry a young girl,

当年琼恩・艾林娶徒利家的小骚货时 他们怎么不去叽歪
but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?

你得再娶个年轻姑娘咯
You'll be needing a new young girl.

是啊
Yeah.

咱得合计合计这事儿
Got that to look forward to.

而你
And you,

成了北境守护
the Warden of the North.

再也不用向史塔克们俯首称臣了
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

真是苦了你了
Must have been torture

一路跟着那个傻小子征战
following that stupid boy all over the country.

他从来没有听从我的建议
He ignored my advice at every turn.

假如当初他稍微收敛一点…
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

竟然自称少狼主
Calling himself the Young Wolf.

瞧给他得瑟的
How's that for pomposity?

敬少狼主
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

永远年少
Forever young.

战争已经结束了 你会搬去临冬城住么
Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?

总归是会的吧
At some point perhaps.

然而临冬城已经成了一片废墟
But Winterfell's in ruins.

是啊
Yeah.

那里究竟发生了什么
What happened up there?

听说被那个葛雷乔伊家的儿子占领了
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

他宰了所有的信鸦
I heard he killed all the ravens.

那以后就没信儿了
And after that, nothing.

我派了私生子拉姆斯去讨伐他
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

罗柏・史塔克对那些铁民给予特赦
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn

只要他们把席恩交出来
if they gave us Theon.

噢 然后呢？
Oh. And?

拉姆斯把话带过去了
Ramsay delivered the terms.

铁民交出了席恩 预料之中的事
The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would.

五花大绑地交了出来
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

不过呢 拉姆斯…
But Ramsaywell...

他有他自己的行事方式
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

拉姆斯・雪诺
卢斯・波顿的私生子

看来 姑娘们句句属实啊
Well, the girls weren't lying.

你那话儿还真不小
You had a goodsized cock.

席恩・葛雷乔伊
铁群岛继承人

咋了？
What?

不是啦
No.

猪肉肠而已
Pork sausage.

你以为我是哪来的野人么？
You think I'm some sort of savage?

人们说起幻肢
People talk about phantom limbs.

一个人就算被砍掉了脚 他也会感觉到原先有脚的地方会痒
An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.

所以 我就纳闷了…
So I've always wondered...

太监是不是也有“幻鸡巴”？
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

当你以后想到裸女
Next time you think about naked girls,

你的幻鸡巴会不会有点痒？
would you feel an itch?

不好意思
Sorry.

我不该开玩笑
I shouldn't make jokes.

妈妈教过我不要对残废扔石头
My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.

但是我父亲说 瞄准脑袋再扔
But my father taught me to aim for their head.

杀了我
Kill me.

抱歉 什么？
Sorry, what?

杀了我
Kill me.

再大点声
A little louder.

杀了我吧！
Kill me!

你死了对我又没什么好处
You're no good to me dead.

我们需要你
We need you.

你看起来都不像“席恩・葛雷乔伊”了
You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

那是贵族的名字
That's a name for a lord.

而你不是什么贵族
But you're not a lord,

是吧
are you?

你只是块肉
You're just meat.

一块烂肉
Stinking meat.

你散发着臭气
You reek.

臭佬！
Reek!

这名字蛮适合你啊
That's a good name for you.

你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

席恩・葛雷乔伊
Theon Greyjoy.

你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

席 
Th

席恩・葛雷乔伊
Theon Greyjoy.

求求你
Please.

你叫什么名字？！
What is your name?!

臭佬
Reek.

我的名字是…
My name is...

臭佬
Reek.

阿多
Hodor.

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人事务官

别杀我！ 什么人？
Don't kill me! Who are you?

山姆！山姆！ 你是什么人？！
Sam! Sam! Who are you?!

我叫吉莉 不要伤害我们
Gilly. Don't hurt us.

你们要去哪？
Where are you going?

去黑城堡 我是一名守夜人
To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

我哥哥 他也在守… 嘘
My brother, he's in the Night'sShush.

你哥哥是谁？ 那不重要
Who's your brother? Doesn't matter.

你是琼恩的弟弟
You're Jon's brother.

那个从窗户坠下去的
The one who fell from the window.

我没有
No, I'm not.

我认识白灵 知道冰原狼长什么样
I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿与妻子

我也听说过阿多
And I've heard all about Hodor.

阿多
Hodor.

要不是琼恩 我早没命了
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

如果你是他的弟弟 那么你也是我的兄弟
If you're his brother, you're my brother, too.

我会尽我所能帮助你
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

带我们去长城以北
Take us north of the Wall.

什么？
What?

你怎么会想去…
Why in the world would you want to go

我不是想去 我必须去
I don't want to. I have to.

你们是怎么穿过长城的？
How did you get through the Wall?

那口井是不是通向地下河？ 你们是从那儿过来的么？
Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?

跟我们走吧
Come with us.

长城南面刻有阶梯
There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.

阿多可以背你上去
Hodor can carry you to the top.

我们直接回到黑城堡
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

跟我们走吧 长城以北只有死路一条
Come with us. There's nothing north but death.

琼恩如果还活着
If Jon is alive,

他会回黑城堡去的
then Castle Black's where he'll be.

你们在那里最安全
It's the safest place for you.

现在不管哪里都不在安全 你知道的
There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.

我亲眼见到过
What I know is what I saw.

如果你也见到了 你绝不会往那儿走
And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.

你见到异鬼和亡者大军
You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.

你怎么知道的？
How do you know all that?

守夜人抵挡不了它们
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

维斯特洛所有的国王和他们的军队都抵挡不了
The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.

你们这是要去抵挡它们？
But you're going to stop them?

让我们去吧 山姆
Please, Sam.

我必须去北边
I have to go north.

必须去
I have to.

巴隆・葛雷乔伊
铁群岛大王

“巴隆・葛雷乔伊 铁群岛公爵
"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands

和北境的入侵者
and invader of the North.

限你在满月之前
I give you until the full moon

令麾下所有的铁种杂碎们离开北境
to order all ironborn scum out of the North

滚回你们沾满臭粪的石头上
and back to those shitstained rocks

你们所谓的老家
you call a home.

亚拉・葛雷乔伊
席恩的姐姐

然后到了满月的那一夜
On the first night of the full moon,

我会捉住每一个
I will hunt down every islander

留在我们地盘的岛民 活剥了他们的皮
still in our lands and flay them living

就像我剥了临冬城的那
the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum

二十个铁民渣滓的皮一样
I found at Winterfell.

盒子里有一份送给你们的小礼物
In the box you'll find a special gift

席恩最爱的玩具
Theon's favorite toy.

我给他割下来的时候他还哭了
He cried when I took it away from him.

立刻从北境撤军 否则我会送更多盒子过来
Leave the North now or more boxes will follow

每个盒子里都有你们的席恩
with more Theon.

署名 拉姆斯・雪诺
Signed Ramsay Snow,

恐怖堡公爵 北境守护
naturalborn son of Roose Bolton,

卢斯・波顿的亲生儿子
Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."

把那玩意儿拿走
Get that out of my sight.

席恩不听我的指挥
Theon disobeyed my orders.

那小子是个白痴
The boy is a fool.

他没法给葛雷乔伊家传宗接代了
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

我不会放弃已经占领的地盘
I will not give up the lands I have seized,

拿下的要塞
the strongholds I have taken.

快拿走
Get this away from me.

他是你的儿子
He's your son.

儿子？
Son?

他连个男人都不是了
He's not a man anymore.

他是你的儿子
He's your son.

是我的弟弟
He's my brother.

是葛雷乔伊家的人
He's a Greyjoy.

注意自己的言行
Watch yourself.

我决心已定
I've made my decision.

我也是
And I've made mine.

我要乘舰队里最快的船
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.

我要挑选铁群岛上最厉害的五十个杀手
I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

拿着绳子！
Get those ropes!

我要沿着狭海北上
I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea

驶入泪江
all the way to the Weeping Water.

我要向恐怖堡进发
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

我要找到我的弟弟
I'm going to find my little brother

然后 我要带他回家
and I'm going to bring him home.

这是什么？
What is it?

龙晶
Dragonglass.

是我们在拳峰发现的
We found them at the Fist.

很久以前 有人埋在那里
Someone buried them a long time ago.

希望被我们找到
Someone wanted us to find them.

为什么？它们有什么用？
Why? What are they for?

能杀死异鬼
Killing white walkers.

你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

那个异鬼冲着我的孩子走来
The walker came for my baby.

然后山姆…
And Sam...

但是几千年来都没有人杀死过异鬼
But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.

总归有人第一个吃螃蟹吧
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.

拿着 阿多
Take it, Hodor.

弓箭手也用得到
And the archer.

我面对一个异鬼
I got lucky

侥幸逃生
with one of them.

他们还有更多
There are more.

多得很
Many more.

而且每一个异鬼
And for every one of them,

伴随着的尸鬼
the dead men,

数不胜数
more than you could count.

真希望你们能跟我们走
I wish you'd come with us.

我也希望可以
I wish I could.

可惜情非所愿
I really do.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

身体还好么？
How are you keeping?

棒极了
Great.

詹德利
“大牛” 劳勃・拜拉席恩的私生子

好得不能再好
Never better.

只是一点血罢了
It was just a bit of blood.

我早该想到了
I should have known.

只要有出身名门的人打听我的名字 准没好事
Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

在你们看来 我们就不算做人 是么
We're not really people to you, are we?

只是你们达成目的的各种手段而已
Just a million different ways to get what you want.

我并非出身名门 她管你叫“爵士”
I'm not a highborn. She called you Ser.

我听到了
I heard it.

那是后来的事了
A recent state of affairs.

我和你一样 也是在跳蚤窝出生的
I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.

可不是嘛
Sure, you were.

你是我的朋友 来救我的咯
You're my friend. You're here to help.

我在面粉街下面一带住过
I lived below the Street of Flour.

离面粉街多远？
How far below?

离红堡又有多近？
How close to the Red Keep were you?

从红堡下水道涌出的屎尿
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

沿着制革道流向伊耿高丘的一端
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill

恰好从我门前经过
along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door

那是在...松酒巷
on Gin Alley. Gin Alley.

钢铁街
The Street of Steel,

整天与你的盔甲和骑士在一起？ 噗
with your armor and your knights? Pfft.

你可在城镇最热闹的地方住过
You lived in the fancy part of town.

但我们现在却在这里
And here we are now.

两个跳蚤窝出身的男孩身处于国王的城堡之中
Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.

是啊 我们走了好长一段路
Yeah, we've come a long way.

我们是一路人 真的
We're all the same, really.

她费尽心机向我指出这一点
She went to great pains to point that out to me.

既然你都不信任那些衣冠楚楚的人
If you mistrust fancy people so much,

为什么会轻信她的鬼话？
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

如果你是我的话
You're me.

从来没亲近过女人
Never been with a woman.

连话都没跟女人说过 真的
Never talked to a woman, really.

然后她来到了你面前 
And then she comes at you

一番大话 一丝不挂
big words, no clothes.

换了是你你会怎么做？
What would you have done?

她懂得如何操纵一个男人 这确实不假
She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.

话说 你是怎么成为贵族的？
So how'd you become a lord?

哦 那个说来话长
Oh, that's a long story.

那最好别说了 我可不想听长篇大论
Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

许多年前我帮助史坦尼斯国王
Many years ago I helped King Stannis

渡过难关
out of a difficult situation.

他赐予我贵族头衔
He rewarded me with a lordship.

还有这个
And this.

你瞧？
You see?

贵族们
Highborns.

我本不想成为贵族
I didn't want to be a lord.

我差点就拒绝了
I nearly didn't accept.

那为何又接受了？
Why did you?

为了我儿子
I did it for my son.

我不想他每次都要趟着屎尿
I didn't want him to step over a river of shit

进家门
every time he stepped through his front door

我希望他能过得好一点
I wanted him to have a better life.

那么他现在过得好么？
Does he?

他死了
He's dead.

怎么死的？
How'd he die?

追随我而死
Following me.

你是什么时候来到这个陌生的国度的？
When did you come to this strange country?

13岁的时候
When I was 13.

你那时还是个孩子
You were only a child.

我九岁时就不再是孩子了
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

我母亲可以为此作证
My mother made sure of that.

要知道 你给我俩的朋友带来了
You've been a good influence

正面的影响
on our mutual friend, you know.

他曾酗酒 从日落到日出
He used to drink from sundown to sunup,

一晚上光顾三座妓院
visit three brothels a night,

赌输他父亲的钱
gamble away his father's money.

而现在他仅仅是酗酒而已
Now it's just the drinking.

而现在我则是他夫人的女仆
And now I'm his wife's servant.

我为她梳头 帮她修指甲
I brush her hair and clip her nails

替她倒尿壶
and empty her chamber pot.

她是个年轻的小甜心
She is a sweet young thing.

这一切都不是她的错
None of this is her fault.

我爱那个女孩 为了她我不惜杀人
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

你认为这样就能让我好过一点？
Do you think that makes it easier for me?

不 我知道不会
No, I expect not.

她年轻 漂亮 血统高贵
She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.

我们与他们一同进餐
We break bread with them,

却不足以使我们与他们成为一家人
but that doesn't make us family.

我们学习他们的语言
We've learned their language,

却从不是他们的同胞
but we'll never be their countrymen.

如果你能让自己相信
If you let yourself believe

一个无名的外来女孩
that a foreign girl with no name

能和泰温・兰尼斯特的儿子共度一生
could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister

我有名字 你是有名字
I have a name. You have one name.

我也有
As do I.

但在这儿姓氏决定一切
Here only the family name matters.

你想从我这儿得到什么 瓦里斯大人？
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

这些钻石
Diamonds.

我会告诉你 携带那么多财宝要时刻提防
I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth,

但你必须懂得如何保护自己
but you know how to protect yourself.

登上那些船中的一艘
Get on one of those ships.

去潘托斯 或是里斯 密尔也行
Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

你可以用这些钻石买一栋房子
You can buy a house with these diamonds,

一栋很大的房子
a very large house.

雇很多仆人
Hire servants.

开始新生活
Start a new life,

远离这里的 美好生活
a good life, far from here.

神秘的异国漂亮妞
The mysterious foreign beauty.

会有成群结队的求婚者向你示爱
You'll have suitors lining up.

为什么你要我离开
Why do you want me to leave?

提利昂・兰尼斯特是仅存的几位
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive

能让这个国家摆脱窘境的人之一
who could make this country a better place.

他有思想 他有决心
He has the mind for it, he has the will,

他有个杰出的姓氏
he has the right last name.

而你
And you

你是个难题
you are a complication.

我知道你爱着他
I know you love him.

我也知道这是真爱 而非由金银所构筑的爱
And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver.

我不是让你为了钱离开他
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

只是单纯地请你离开
I'm asking you to leave

因为在君临 你的存在
because your presence in the capital

将使他陷入危险的境地
endangers him.

这里从来就不是你的家 我的女士
This will never be your home, my lady.

远离此处 去寻找一个真正意义上的家
Find a true home somewhere far from here...

趁现在还来得及
while there's still time.

瓦里斯大人
Lord Varys.

如果是他要我离开 他可以亲自和我说
If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.

再来点
Keep up.

我想我不胜酒力了 大人
I don't think I can, my lord.

想喝醉从来就不是一件容易的事
It's not easy being drunk all the time.

要是容易的话每个人都这么干了
Everyone would do it if it were easy.

退下
Leave.

那么 新婚生活还满意么？
So, enjoying married life?

郁郁寡欢的妻子是酒贩子最好的朋友
An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.

她不该受到如此对待
She doesn't deserve this.

不该？
Deserve?

小心这个想法
Be careful with that.

谁又应该受苦呢？ 一旦你开始思考这个问题
Start trying to work out who deserves what

用不了多久 你就要把余生
and before long you'll spend the rest of your days

用来为世上的每一个人悲伤了
weeping for each and every person in the world.

还有什么比大器晚成的“哲学家”更糟的
There's nothing worse than a lateblooming philosopher.

你能用同样的哲学理念让自己接受
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras

和洛拉斯爵士的婚姻么？
with the same philosophical spirit?

我不会嫁给洛拉斯爵士
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

我记得对于自己的婚姻
I seem to remember saying something similar

我也说过类似的话
about my own marriage.

你不能和我比
You're not me.

你真想为珊莎好？
You want to make things better for Sansa?

那就给她一个孩子
Give her a child.

这样你就可以告诉父亲
So you can tell Father it was you

最终说服了我的鸡巴的人是你？
who finally talked me into it?

这样她就能在生命中获得一些快乐
So she can have some happiness in her life.

你有孩子
You have children.

说说看你有多快乐？
How happy would you say you are?

不是很多
Not very.

但如果不是为了我的孩子
But if it weren't for my children,

我肯定已经从红堡最高的窗户跳下去了
I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.

他们是我活着的理由
They're the reason I'm alive.

即便是乔佛里？
Even Joffrey?

没错 即便是乔佛里
Even Joffrey.

在弥赛拉出生前
He was all I had once.

他曾经是我的一切
Before Myrcella was born.

我曾经连续几小时
I used to spend hours

就这样看着他
looking at him.

看着他那一撮撮的头发
His wisps of hair.

看着他娇小的手脚
His tiny little hands and feet.

他是一个如此活泼快乐的小宝贝
He was such a jolly little fellow.

人们常说 坏人从小就是坏胚
You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.

“我们早该知道 从小我们就该看出来了”
"We should have known. Even then we should have known."

真是无稽之谈
It's nonsense.

和我在一起的时候 他始终是那么快乐
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

没人能夺走这一切
And no one can take that away from me,

即便是乔佛里
not even Joffrey

这就是当你拥有
how it feels to have someone.

一个属于自己的人时的感觉
Someone of your own.

还要持续多久？
How long does it go on?

直到我们解决所有的敌人
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

每当我们击败一个敌人
Every time we deal with an enemy,

就创造出两个新的
we create two more.

那我想这得需要很长一段时间
Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.

和你说 当时她是这样的
I'm telling you, that's what she did.

听起来像是一头发情的母牛
Sounded like a cow in heat.

哈 没持续多久 是的
Aye, not for long. That's right.

黑瓦德很快让她闭了嘴
Black Walder shut her up right quick.

那顿饭过后 史塔克们的嘴里再也吐不出一个字了
None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.

尽管这样 我还是要说
I'll tell you what, though.

最困难的事还是把狼头钉在身体上
The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.

是你缝上去的？ 是我干的
You sewed it on? I did.

我打赌有1000个人会这么说
I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one.

真的是我
It was me.

还有马可和塔波特
And Malcolm and Talbott.

听我讲 那玩意儿太重 一开始掉了下来
Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time.

还带着皮
Took the skin right with it.

最后我们不得不用针
What we ended up having to do was hook the needle

勾住锁骨下方
right under the collarbone.

这样能有个不错的固定点 然后
Give it a nice firm mooring and

你想干什么
What do you want?

我能烤烤火么？ 滚开
Mind if I keep warm? Fuck off.

我很饿
But I'm hungry.

让你滚听不懂么？
Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?

我有钱
I've got money.

那是什么硬币？
What kind of coin is that?

它值很多钱
It's worth a lot.

抱歉
Sorry.

小混蛋
Little shit.

蠢材！
Fool!

你从哪儿搞到的小刀？
Where did you get the knife?

从你那儿
From you.

杀的第一个人？
Is that the first man you've killed?

第一个人
The first man.

下次要干类似的活
Next time you're going to do something like that,

先跟我说
tell me first.

Valar morghulis

很多很多年前就不是了
Not for many, many years.

你是否还记得你发过的誓
do you remember the oath you swore

在你加入守夜人时许下的？
when you joined this order?

他不是我的孩子 伊蒙学士
He's not my child, Maester Aemon.

他是卡斯特众多妻子中的一位
She's one of Craster's wives.

我谨记誓言
I remember every word of the oath.

长夜将至 我从今开始守望
Night gathers and my watch begins.

我是守护王国人民的坚盾
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

王国的人民
The realms of men.

意味着她和我们都在其中

它冲着我们所有人来了

吉莉 你和你的儿子

Why is there a G in night?

我不知道 反正就这么写
I don't know. There just is.

反正 你父亲不会参加的
Well, your father's not going to go to that.

我的书本比这些乏味的卷轴有趣
My books are better than these boring scrolls.

你能读到黑死神贝勒里恩的故事呢
You could read about Balerion the Dread.

他们说在红堡下的地牢里你还能看到它的颅骨
They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the
Red Keep.

有天能去看看就好了
I'd like to see that someday.

我这辈子都不想再进地牢了
I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.

它的尖牙和巨剑一样长 "
"His fangs were as long as bastard swords."

被手下封臣背叛
Betrayed by his bannerman.

我无需居功
I take no credit.

我有信仰 而我的虔诚得到了回应
I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.

陛下 这世道已然光怪陆离
Your Grace, the world has got so far bent.

我也见识过噩梦中的种种怪物成为现实
I've seen things crawl out of nightmares,

但我仍能明辨是非
but my eyes were open.

我虽不知罗柏・史塔克的死是因为红袍女的巫术
I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery

还是因为打起仗来 人命就朝不保夕
or because at war men die all the time,

但我明白 用血魔法来
but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms

一统七大王国大错特错
with blood magic is wrong.

这是邪恶之举
It is evil.

而您绝非邪恶之人
And you are not an evil man.

你知道谁雕刻油漆了这张桌子吧 戴佛斯爵士？
Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?

是伊耿・坦格利安
Aegon Targaryen.

那你知道伊耿・坦格利安是怎么征服维斯特洛的吗？
And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?

靠他的巨龙黑死神贝勒里恩
On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.

他的舰队和军队
He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced

都比他的敌人少得多 但他拥有三条龙
and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.

那时你一定累得想停在那儿 千万别 她会找到你的
You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.

那我该去哪？
Where should I go?

继续向前 保持海岸线在你左手边
You must keep the coast on your left side

一直划到君临
until you reach King's Landing.

金袍子还在搜我呢
The gold cloaks are looking for me.

他们已经搜了我二十年
They were looking for me for 20 years.

他们知道你相貌了？没
Do they know your face? No.

我会更提防红袍女
I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

转过来
The other way.

你以前乘过船吗？
You ever been in a boat before?

没
No.

会游泳吗？
You know how to swim?

不会
No.

那就别掉下水
Don't fall out.

出发吧
Go on.

你为什么这么做？
Why are you doing this?

因为这么做是对的
Because it's right.

我仍有职责谏言您不要这样做
it is my duty to advise you against it.

您会需要我的辅佐 带他下去

马索斯生前教过我
Matthos taught me before he died

这样我能更好地辅佐您
so I could be of better service to you.

这场五王之战已毫无意义

真正的战争在北方 陛下
The true war lies to the north, my king.

死亡正向长城进军
Death marches on the Wall.

只有您能力挽狂澜
Only you can stop him.

只靠您一个人不行

您需要人来为您重建军队
You need someone to rebuild your army for you,

游说领主 让他们为您而战

将佣兵和海盗聚于您靡下

自由掌握在你们每一个人手中
