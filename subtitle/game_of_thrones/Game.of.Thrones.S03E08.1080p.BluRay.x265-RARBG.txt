次子

艾莉亚・史塔克

桑铎・克里冈
“猎狗”

我只给你一次机会 丫头
I'll give you one try, girl.

杀了我 你就自由了
Kill me and you're free.

但要是杀不了我 那我就拧断你的双手
But if I live, I'll break both your hands.

来呀 砸我
Go on, hit me.

使点劲
Hit me hard.

你挺爱生闷气
Sulk all you want.

事实上 你幸运得很
The truth is, you're lucky.

这地儿你也不想一个人呆吧 丫头
You don't want to be alone out here, girl.

只会被更糟糕的人逮住
Someone worse than me would find you.

没有比你更糟糕的人了
There's no one worse than you.

哈 你没见过我老哥吧
Ha, you never knew my brother.

他曾经因为别人打鼾就把他杀了
He once killed a man for snoring.

这可比我糟糕多了
There's plenty worse than me.

有人喜欢殴打小姑娘
There's men who like to beat little girls,

还有人喜欢强奸小姑娘
men who like to rape them.

我从他们手里救了你姐姐
I saved your sister from some of them.

你撒谎
You're lying.

下次见到她 你可以问问
Ask her, if you ever see her again.

问问她 暴民们要从后面上她的时候
Ask her who came back for her

是谁返回来救她的
when the mob had her on her back.

他们会用各种姿势上遍她
They would have taken her every which way

割了她的脖子 然后扬长而去
and left her there with her throat cut open.

那是黑水河么？
Is that the Blackwater?

黑水河？
The Blackwater?

你以为我要带你去哪？
Where do you think I'm taking you?

回君临 你要把我献给乔佛里和太后
Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.

去你妈的乔佛里 去你妈的太后
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen.

那是红叉河
That's the Red Fork.

我要带你去孪河城
I'm taking you to the Twins.

为什么？
But why?

去找你老妈老哥
Because your mother and brother will be there

他们会付钱赎你
and they'll pay me for you.

为什么他们会在孪河城？
Why would they be at the Twins?

你那帮亲爱的绿林好汉没跟你说过？
Those outlaws you love so much never told you?

全国上下都在谈论这事
The whole countryside is yapping about it.

你舅舅要娶佛雷家的小姐
Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.

你要是不惦记着砸我的脑袋
So quit trying to bash my skull in

没准儿咱们还能赶上婚礼
and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
风暴降生 龙之母

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
前任御林铁卫队长

乔拉・莫尔蒙
“大熊” 熊老之子

为了金钱战斗的人没有任何荣誉或忠诚可言
Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty.

不值得信任
They cannot be trusted.

他们为了钱会杀任何人
They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid.

渊凯人钱给得很足
The Yunkish are paying them well.

你听说过这些人？
You know these men?

我认得他们旗帜上的断剑
Only by the broken swords on their banners.

他们是次子团
They're called the Second Sons.

领头的是布拉佛斯人梅罗
A company led by a Braavosi named Mero,

外号“泰坦私生子”
"The Titan's Bastard."

那他到底是泰坦还是私生子？
Is he more titan or bastard?

他很危险 卡丽熙
He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

他们都很危险
They all are.

有多少人？
How many?

回陛下 两千骑兵
2,000, Your Grace.

全副武装
Armored and mounted.

不可小觑？
Enough to make a difference?

跟尸体要账可不容易
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

佣兵们大概也更喜欢站在胜者一边吧
I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.

您说得对
I imagine you're right.

我想跟泰坦私生子谈谈谁是胜者的问题
I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

他不会来的
He may not agree to meet.

他会
He will.

为了金钱搏命的人 不会甘心向小姑娘认输
A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

陛下 请允许我向您引见
Your Grace, allow me to present

次子团的团长… 
the captains of the Second Sons

布拉佛斯的梅罗
Mero of Braavos,

普兰达・纳・纪森
Prendahl na Ghezn,

以及… 
and...

达里奥・纳哈里斯
Daario Naharis.

梅罗
“泰坦的私生子” 次子团团长

你就是龙之母？
You are the Mother of Dragons?

我肯定在里斯的妓院里操过你
I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.

管住你的舌头 为什么？
Mind your tongue. Why?

我可不介意她用舌头
I didn't mind hers.

舔过我屁眼呢 那功夫真是与生俱来
She licked my ass like she was born to do it.

你 小女奴 拿酒来
You, slave girl, bring wine.

这儿没有奴隶
We have no slaves here.

等仗打完了你们全得做奴隶
You'll all be slaves after the battle

除非我发话
unless I save you.

脱衣服 坐我大腿上
Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap

你取悦了我 我也许就把次子团带过来
and I may give you my Second Sons.

你把次子团带过来 我也许不会阉你
Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.

巴利斯坦爵士 次子团有多少兵力？
Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?

不到两千 陛下
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

我们的人要比这多吧？
We have more, don't we?

一万无垢者
10,000 Unsullied.

我只是个年轻女子 不懂战争之道
I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war,

弥桑黛
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

或许像您一样久经沙场的团长
but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself

乐意给我解释下你们怎么可能打赢
can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.

但愿这位老人家使剑功夫强过嘴上功夫
I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.

你们只有八千无垢者
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

达里奥・纳哈里斯
次子团成员

你这么年轻就能当团长？
You're very young to be a captain.

他不是团长 他是伍长
He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

普兰达・纳・纪森
次子团团长

即使按你说的人数来算
Even if your numbers are right,

实力如此悬殊 获胜的机会微乎其微啊
you must admit the odds don't favor your side.

次子团面对过更悬殊的情况 并赢得胜利
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.

次子团面对过更悬殊的情况 结果是逃跑
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.

你们可以考虑为我效力
Or you could fight for me.

我们已经拿了奴隶主的钱
We've taken the slavers' gold.

我们为渊凯而战
We fight for Yunkai.

我会付你同样多的费用 甚至更多
I would pay you as much and more.

契约是我们的命脉
Our contract is our bond.

断了命脉
If we break our bond,

就没人愿跟次子团签契约了
no one will hire the Second Sons again.

为我效劳 次子团就无需再寻求雇主了
Ride with me and you'll never need another contract.

等我夺回七大王国时
You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing

你将得到财富 城堡和你想要的封号
when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

你没有船 也没有攻城武器
You have no ships. You have no siege weapons.

你甚至没有骑兵
You have no cavalry.

两星期前 我还没有军队
A fortnight ago, I had no army.

一年前 我甚至没有龙
A year ago, I had no dragons.

给你两天时间考虑
You have two days to decide.

快露出你的逼来 让我看看到底值不值得为之一战
Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.

我的女王 要我切掉他的舌头吗？

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

他们是我的客人

你看起来挺喜欢我的酒
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

或许你需要一壶酒才能思考
Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.

一壶？
Only a flagon?

那我军队里的兄弟怎么办？
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

那就一桶 不错
A barrel, then. Good.

泰坦私生子可不会独个儿喝闷酒
The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

在我们次子团 东西都是共享的
In the Second Sons, we share everything.

等打完仗 我们没准会一起上了你
After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.

等这一切都完事儿后 我会来找你的
I'll come looking for you when this is over.

巴利斯坦爵士
Ser Barristan,

开战后先杀这个人
if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

乐于效劳 陛下
Gladly, Your Grace.

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

詹德利
“大牛” 铁匠学徒

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
狭海中的王

你体内流淌着劳勃和贱民的血
Half Robert, half lowborn.

把这孩子带去他的房间
Show the boy to his chambers.

让女仆给他洗个澡 再找点得体的衣服给他穿上
Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.

我很快就会去看你
I'll come visit you soon.

你打算拿他怎么办？
What do you mean to do with him?

你知道我的打算
You know what I mean to do with him.

那为什么还让他沐浴，为他更衣？
Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?

如果必须那样做的话 就赶紧完成 别折磨那孩子
If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

你宰过羊羔吗？国王陛下？
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

没有
No.

如果让羊羔看到刀子
If the lamb sees the knife,

它会恐惧
she panics.

而恐惧会影响它的肉质
Her panic seeps into her meat,

变得暗沉无味
darkens it, fouls the flavor.

你杀过很多羊羔？
You've slaughtered many lambs?

没有一只看到了刀刃
And none have seen the blade.

还有那… 还有那个...
"And thoand thowg...

维维维桑尼亚...
Vvvisenya...

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

坦格利安...
Targaryen...

加… 驾
rodrode

瓦格哈尔… 
Vhagar

维哈… 
Vhag"

我操
Fuck me.

维桑尼亚 坦格利安
"Visenya Targaryen

驾着瓦格哈尔
rode Vhagar,

体型最小的那条龙
the smallest of the dragons,

还是...
though still...

大得… 
large enog

能… 能
enoughenough

能吞下整匹马
to swallow a horse whole."

陛下
Your Grace.

你吃的饱吗？
They feeding you enough?

一天两餐
Two meals a day.

冰凉的早餐 热乎的晚餐
Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.

没什么好抱怨的
I cannot complain.

你不适合这种地方
You don't belong in a place like this.

这个嘛 很抱歉这样说 不过我看过更糟糕的地方
Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

好吧
Yeah.

你儿子的事 真遗憾
I'm sorry about your son.

之前没机会跟你说
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

一个好孩子 忠诚的孩子
Good lad. Loyal lad.

梅丽珊卓回来了
Melisandre's returned.

我连她走了都不知道
I didn't know she'd been gone.

带着个私生子回来
Came back with a bastard boy.

劳勃的私生子
Robert's bastard boy.

为什么？
Why?

她说国王的血脉蕴含着力量
She says there's power in king's blood.

她要杀了他
She's going to kill him.

献祭他
Sacrifice him.

原谅我这样说 陛下 我没什么文化
Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man,

不过 杀了他和献祭他之间有什么区别吗？
but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?

那孩子是你的侄子
The boy is your nephew.

那又如何？我们在打仗
What of it? We're at war.

凭什么放过一个酒馆婊子养的儿子？
Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut

劳勃只是喝醉睡了她一晚 才有他的
Robert bedded one drunken night?

因为他血管中流着和你一样的血
Because he has your blood in his veins.

蓝礼也一样
So did Renly.

蓝礼触犯了你
Renly wronged you.

王座本应属于你 他却自称为王
Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.

他召集了军队 偷走了你的封臣
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

这孩子什么都没做
This boy has done you no harm.

他是无辜的  维斯特洛有多少男孩？
He's an innocent. How many boys live in Westeros?

多少女孩？多少男人 多少女人？
How many girls? How many men? How many women?

她说到黑暗将把他们全部吞没
The darkness will devour them all, she says.

永不终结的长夜
The night that never ends.

除非我能够胜利
Unless I triumph.

我从没要求过这些
I never asked for this.

就像我从来没想要当国王
No more than I asked to be king.

我们无法选择命运
We do not choose our destiny,

但必须履行职责 对不对？
but we must do our duty, no?

伟大抑或渺小 人人都必须履行自己的职责
Great or small, we must do our duty.

一个私生子怎么能和整个王国相提并论
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

陛下
Your Grace,

你为什么来探视？
why did you come to see me today?

我来释放你
I came to free you.

只要你发誓 再也不伤害梅丽珊卓夫人
If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

我发誓
I swear it.

但我无法承诺不出言反对她
I can't swear never to speak against her.

你就那么不在乎自己的性命
You have little regard for your own life.

确实 陛下
Quite little, Your Grace.

完全不在乎
Verging on none.

你本可以昨天或是明天释放我
You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

但是你偏偏现在来 就在那孩子要躺在利刃下之前
but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife

因为你知道我会劝你
because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

你到这里来听我说 因为你自己心里也是这样认为的
You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.

你不是一个能滥杀无辜的人
You're not a man who slaughters innocents

不管是为了利益还是为了荣耀
for gain or glory.

我儿子五岁的时候 他对我说
When my son was five he said to me,

我永远不想死
"I don't ever want to die."

我很想对他说 “你不会的 孩子 你永远不会死的 ”
I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child. You won't ever."

我不想看到他在黑暗中醒着 心慌意乱
I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

我想肯定是孩子的父母们创造出了诸神
I think mothers and fathers made up the gods

因为他们希望自己的孩子们可以在夜里睡得安稳
because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.

我在火焰里看到了
I saw a vision in the flames.

雪地里的大战
A great battle in the snow.

我看到了
I saw it.

而且你也看到了她生下来的那东西
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

我以前从不相信 但是你看到了事实
I never believed, but when you see the truth,

事实就这样摆在眼前
when it's right there in front of you

像这些铁栅栏一样真实无误
as real as these iron bars,

你怎么还能否认她的神呢？
how can you deny her god is real?

那龙婊子 她的话太多了
Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.

你也话太多了
You talk too much.

让她含着我的老二 看她还有什么话好说
She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.

她和你的老二之间隔着8000个无垢者
8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock.

我的老二总能找到路子
My cock will find a way.

告诉他 有什么地方是我的老二进不去的吗？
Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?

你付了钱 让她说什么都行
She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

达里奥・纳哈里斯 不喜欢婊子的婊子
Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.

我很喜欢她们 我只是拒绝付钱
I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them.

而且我不是婊子 我的朋友
And I'm no whore, my friend.

她卖她的“剑鞘” 你卖你的宝剑
She sells her sheath and you sell your blade.

有区别吗？  我为美而战
What's the difference? I fight for beauty.

为美？
For beauty?

我们为金子而战
We fight for gold.

在我们死掉之前 诸神赐予男人两件礼物 让我们开心
The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die

操想被操的女人
the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked

杀想杀你的男人
and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.

你不会长命的
You'll die young.

我们要拿那个龙女怎么办
What do we do about the dragon girl?

我们不能在战场上和8000个无垢者硬碰硬
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.

我们不打仗 我们用不着对付那些太监
There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.

我们只要对付她就行了
We only have to deal with her.

她被保护的很好  今晚是新月
She's well guarded. Tonight's a new moon.

我们中间的一个 避开那些无垢者和骑士 溜进她的帐篷
One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.

我们中的哪一个？
Which one of us?

闭上眼睛 亲爱的
Close your eyes, love.

三个硬币
Three coins.

一个来自弥林
A coin from Meereen,

一个来自瓦兰提斯
a coin from Volantis,

还有一个来自布拉佛斯
and a coin from Braavos.

拿到布拉佛硬币的人去做
The Braavosi does the deed.

我们每个人都有份 亲爱的
One for each of us, darling.

别偷看
No peeking.

听到了没有？
Do you hear me?

跟着我的声音来 我就在这里
Follow my voice. I'm right here.

你有东西要给我？
You have something for me?

Valar morghulis
Valar morghulis.

珊莎・史塔克

雪伊
珊莎的侍女 小恶魔的情人

珊莎小姐
Lady Sansa.

你看起来英姿飒爽 大人
You look very handsome, my lord.

哦 没错
Oh, yes.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔” 财政大臣

波德瑞克・派恩
提利昂的侍从

正如你的梦中情人
The husband of your dreams.

不过你真是太迷人了
But you do look glorious.

也许我们应该单独聊聊
Perhaps we could have a moment alone.

你觉得呢？
Do you mind?

波德瑞克 你可以帮忙护送史塔克小姐的女仆吗？
Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?

我的小姐
My lady,

我希望你知道
I want you to know

这不是我想要的
I didn't ask for this.

希望我没有让您失望 大人
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

不 不要这样
No, don't.

你和我说话 不需要再像个阶下囚
You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore.

从今天开始 你不再是阶下囚
You won't be a prisoner after today.

你会成为我的夫人
You'll be my wife.

或许那是另一种囚禁
I suppose that's a different kind of prison.

我只是想说
I just wanted to say

我只是努力想说却说不好
I'm just trying to say very badly

我只想
I just

只想说我知道你现在的感觉
just want to say I know how you feel.

我不太相信这一点 大人
I doubt that very much, my lord.

你说得对
You're right.

我完全不了解你到底有什么感觉
I have no idea how you feel.

你也完全不了解我是什么感觉
And you have no idea how I feel.

但是我能保证一件事 我的夫人
But I promise you one thing, my lady.

我永远不会伤害你
I won't ever hurt you.

你喝酒吗？
Do you drink wine?

要喝的时候会喝
When I have to.

那么 今天你要喝
Well, today you have to.

你看起来容光焕发 殿下
You look radiant, Your Grace.

容光焕发？为什么是容光焕发？
Radiant? Why radiant?

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

玛格丽・提利尔
乔佛里国王的未婚妻

因为这正是我心中所想的
It's the word that came to mind.

我们马上会成为姐妹
We're going to be sisters soon.

我们应该能成为好朋友
We should be friends.

你喜欢音乐 不是吗？
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

我想你一定有副好嗓子
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

恐怕还是跳舞比唱歌拿手
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

好吧 但你可听说过“卡斯特梅的雨季”这首歌？
Ah, but you know the song "The Rains of Castamere"?

当然 宫廷中常常演奏这首歌
Of course. They play it so often here at court.

所以你知道卡斯特梅城的雷耶斯家族喽
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?

我相信一定不如您了解
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

雷耶斯家族曾是个强大的家族
House Reyne was a powerful family.

非常富有
Very wealthy.

维斯特洛第二富有的家族
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

现在提利尔家族是维斯特洛第二富有的家族了吧？
Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?

毫无疑问 有野心的攀爬者怎么会逗留在
Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop

第二高的阶梯呢
on the second highest rung.

只要你再往上爬一步
If only you could take that final step,

你就能比别人都看得远
you'd see further than all the rest.

陪伴你的只有头顶上蔚蓝的天空
You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.

所以雷耶斯伯爵造了一个城堡
So Lord Reyne built a castle

和凯岩城一样宏伟
as grand as Casterly Rock.

他送给妻子的那些钻石
He gave his wife diamonds

比我母亲戴过的任何一只都大
larger than any my mother ever wore.

终于有一天
And finally one day,

他反叛了我的父亲
he rebelled against my father.

你可知雷耶斯家族现在怎样？
Do you know where House Reyne is now?

消失了
Gone.

消失了
Gone.

多温和的说法
A gentle word.

为什么不说被杀光了？
Why not say slaughtered?

每一个男人 女人 儿童
Every man, woman, and child

都死于利刃之下
put to the sword.

我记得他们的尸体高高的悬挂在
I remember seeing their bodies hanging

凯岩城的城门之上
high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

我父亲让他们在那里腐烂了整整一个夏天
My father let them rot up there all summer.

那是一个漫长的夏天
It was a long summer.

“雨水在大厅哭泣”
"And now the rains weep o'er their halls,

“内里却无魂灵”
and not a soul to hear."

如果你再叫我一声姐姐
If you ever call me sister again,

就会在睡梦中被掐死
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

您来干什么
What are you doing?

你父亲死了
Your father's gone.

作为七大王国的父亲
As the father of the realm,

理应由我来送你出嫁
it is my duty to give you away to your husband.

波隆
骑士

派席尔
大学士

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛” 情报总管

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

你现在可以为新娘披上斗篷
You may now cloak the bride

将她置于你的保护之下
and bring her under your protection.

大主教
七神的代言人

请你… 
Could you...

谢谢
Thank you.

国王陛下 太后陛下
Your Grace, Your Grace,

大人们 夫人们
my lords, my ladies,

在此 在诸神和世人的见证下
we stand here in the sight of gods and men

新郎与新娘结为夫妻
to witness the union of man and wife.

从今以后 他们就是一个躯体 一个心灵 一个魂魄
One flesh, one heart, one soul,

直到永远
now and forever.

你以前见过这些吗？
Have you ever seen one like it?

这里的东西我都没见过
I've never seen anything like any of this.

这些不属于我的生活
Not in my life.

当你第一次见到真正财富的时候
It's shocking, isn't it,

很令人吃惊 不是吗
the first time you encounter real wealth?

我像你这么大的时候 每天就靠一锅汤过活
When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

里面是什么就不好说了
And stew is a kind word for it.

在跳蚤窝 我们叫它褐粥
In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown.

我们假装里面的肉是鸡肉
We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.

但我们都知道那不是
We knew it wasn't chicken.

来 尝尝这个
Here, taste this.

你觉得我想对你下毒？
You think I'm trying to poison you?

好喝
That's good.

真是好喝
That's really good.

你觉得它来自何处？
Where do you think it's from?

我猜都不敢猜
I couldn't even guess.

那不重要 不是吗
Doesn't matter, does it?

真实或是虚假
It's the real thing or it's not.

你只需要用舌头来尝一尝
You only need a tongue to tell the difference.

继续吧 多喝点
Go on, have some more.

你还是不相信这一切
You still don't trust it.

认为全都是一场误会
You think this is all a mistake

而自己每喝一口都要付出代价
and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.

我的确这么想过
That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.

这里没有误会
There are no mistakes.

我们都没有
Not for us.

我自己就是一个错误
I'm a mistake.

我在这里只是因为我父亲恰好上了我母亲
I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother

而不是酒馆里其他的女人
instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.

你父亲选择你母亲是光之王的旨意
Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.

你在这里也是他的旨意
He willed it so you could be here right now

你 还有你体内的力量
with a power inside you

你对这些一点都不了解
you can't even begin to understand.

是光之王指引我来提取你体内的力量
And He brought me here to draw it from you

并且让它降临到这个世界
and birth it into the world.

我们都是他计划中的一部分
We're both a part of His plan.

他希望我们这样
He wants this for us.

不 他命令我们这样
No, He demands this of us.

我不明白 这… 
I don't understand. This

这看上去不是很虔诚
this doesn't seem very religious.

谁说的？
According to whom?

静默姐妹？
The Silent Sisters?

戴着她们严肃的表情
With their stern looks,

紧闭的双唇 还有干涸的阴道？
muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts?

她们的神为你做过什么？
What have their gods done for you?

唔？
Hmm?

当你向她们祈祷时
When you pray to them,

她们的回应在哪里?
what's their answer?

真实或是虚假
A god is real or he's not.

你只需要用眼睛来看一看
You only need eyes to see.

死亡就要降临于万物
Death is coming for everyone and everything.

黑暗即将吞噬黎明
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.

我们可以阻止它 你和我
And we can stop it, you and I.

让我来展示一下你体内的力量
Let me show you what you have inside you.

来和我一起对抗死亡吧
Come fight death with me.

你在干什么？
What are you doing?

你必须信任我
You have to trust me.

什么… ？
What?

快把它拿走
Get it away.

从我身上拿走
Get it off me.

别挣扎 别挣扎 它们吸不了多少
Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.

你这是干什么？
Why are you doing this?

我告诉过你国王之血蕴含力量
I told you there's power in the blood of kings.

而你有这么多血
And you have so much blood.

不 不 不 不 不！
No. No, no, no, no!

那里不行 那里不行！
Not there. Not there!

你可以怨戴佛斯爵士
You can blame Ser Davos.

他不相信国王之血的力量
He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.

他想要一个证明
He wanted a demonstration.

求求您 求求您 陛下
Please. Please, Your Grace.

大人！
My lord!

篡夺者罗柏・史塔克
The usurper Robb Stark.

篡夺者巴隆・葛雷乔伊
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

篡夺者乔佛里・拜拉席恩
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

那么他们的儿子会是你的侄子
So their son will be your nephew.

奥莲娜夫人
玛格丽・提利尔的祖母

洛拉斯・提利尔
“百花骑士”

当然是在你娶了瑟曦之后
After you're wed to Cersei, of course.

你会是国王的继父
And you will be the king's stepfather

同时也是大舅子
and brotherinlaw.

当你嫁给国王以后
When you marry the king,

乔佛里的母亲会是乔佛里的嫂子
Joffrey's mother will become his sisterinlaw

而你们的儿子会是洛拉斯的外甥
and your son will be Loras' nephew?

或者孙子？ 我搞不清
Grandson? I'm not sure.

但是你的哥哥会是你的公公
But your brother will become your fatherinlaw.

这点绝对没有争议
That much is beyond dispute.

我能离开一会儿吗？
Will you pardon me, my lord?

当然 当然 好… 好好玩
Of course. Of course. Enenjoy.

也许你更应该去找你的未婚妻聊聊
Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead.

我有一辈子的时间和她聊
I've got a lifetime for that.

留在这
Stay.

你看上去醉的不轻
You seem rather drunk.

没我计划的那么醉
Rather less than I plan to be.

在自己婚礼上喝得大醉不是男人的职责么？
Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?

关键的不是婚礼
This isn't about your wedding.

蓝礼・拜拉席恩也有个婚礼
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

你妻子需要个孩子
Your wife needs a child,

一个兰尼斯特孩子 越快越好
a Lannister child, as soon as possible.

还有？ 如果你要给他一个孩子
And? If you're going to give her one,

你需要有所行动
you need to perform.

你有一次叫我什么来着？
What did you once call me?

一个矮小 醉醺醺 充满淫欲的野兽
A drunken little lustfilled beast.

不止一次 那就是了
More than once. There you have it.

别担心
Nothing to worry about.

喝酒和淫乱
Drinking and lust,

这些方面没人能比的上我
no man can match me in these things.

我是乳头和美酒的神
I am the god of tits and wine.

我会在下次去的妓院那里
I shall build a shrine to myself

给自己造个神坛
at the next brothel I visit.

你可以酩酊大醉 你可以花言巧语
You can drink, you can joke,

你可以一直不成熟地挑衅
you can engage in juvenile attempts

让你的父亲不快
to make your father uncomfortable,

但是你要完成你的职责
but you will do your duty.

那个… 
Well...

我的父亲曾经告诉过我… 
My father once told me

没人操心你父亲告诉过你什么
Nobody cares what your father once told you.

恭喜你 小姐
Congratulations, my lady.

谢谢您 陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

不错 你成功了 你嫁给了个兰尼斯特
Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister.

马上你就会有一个兰尼斯特孩子
Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.

你的愿望实现了 不是吗
It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?

多么荣耀的一天
What a glorious day.

是的 陛下
Yes, Your Grace.

我想你不会太介意
I suppose it doesn't really matter

让哪一个兰尼斯特上你吧
which Lannister puts the baby into you.

也许今晚 在我舅舅喝醉之后
Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight

我会来找你
after my uncle passes out.

喜欢吗？
How'd you like that?

不喜欢啊？
You wouldn't?

那也无妨 马林爵士和伊林爵士会帮你躺好的
That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.

闹新房的时间到了
Time for the bedding ceremony.

我不要闹新房
There will be no bedding ceremony.

你不是一向遵循传统的吗 舅舅？
Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?

开始吧 大家
Come, everyone.

把她举起来 抬上婚床
Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.

脱了她的裙服 反正也用不着
Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer.

小姐们 你们负责帮我舅舅 他可不重
Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.

我不要闹新房
There will be no bedding ceremony.

我说闹就得闹
There will be if I command it.

那你自己闹新房时
Then you'll be fucking your own bride

只能用假鸡巴了
with a wooden cock.

你说什么？
What did you say?

你说什么？！
What did you say?!

陛下 闹新房的事我们再商榷
I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.

我相信提利昂并非有意威胁国王
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.

这是个差劲的玩笑 陛下
A bad joke, Your Grace.

只因为我太嫉妒您高贵的命根子
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.

而我的太小了
Mine is so small.

不知道我可怜的妻子到时候能不能察觉到它
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

陛下 您的舅舅明显醉地一塌糊涂
Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.

是啊
I am.

我很惭愧
Guilty.

但是… 
But

大婚之夜
but it is my wedding night.

我和我醉醺醺的小鸡巴还有事要做
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

来吧 老婆
Come, wife.

有次我干到一半
I vomited on a girl once

吐在了那姑娘身上
in the middle of the act.

虽然这事儿没什么可骄傲的
Not proud of it.

但坦诚相待是小两口之间最重要的
But I think honesty is important

你说是不是？
between a man and wife, don't you agree?

来吧 我会全部告诉你
Come, I'll tell you all about it.

让你兴奋起来
Put you in the mood.

这样好吗 大人?
Is that wise, my lord?

提利昂 珊莎
Tyrion, Sansa.

我叫提利昂
My name is Tyrion.

这样好吗 提利昂？
Is that wise, Tyrion?

没有比这更好的了
Nothing was ever wiser.

长得要命啊
Astoundingly long.

什么？
What?

脖子
Neck.

你的脖子
You have one.

你多大了?
How old are you exactly?

十四
14.

好吧 说话也不会让你长大
Well, talk won't make you any older.

我的父亲大人命令我
My lord father has commanded me

必须完成这桩婚事
to consummate this marriage.

停下
Stop.

我做不到
I can't.

我做得到 但我不想
I could, I won't.

但您的父亲… 
But your father

如果我的父亲希望谁遭殃
If my father wants someone to get fucked,

他自然知道该怎么做
I know where he can start.

在你接受我之前
I won't share your bed.

我是不会碰你的
Not until you want me to.

如果我说永远也不行呢?
What if I never want you to?

我从今开始守望
And so my watch begins.

十九?
19?

是的 陛下
Yes, Your Grace.

怎么会有人能说十九种语言呢？
How can anyone speak 19 languages?

陛下只花了一年就能不错地掌握多斯拉克语
It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

是啊 但我要么学会多斯拉克语
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki

要么对着我丈夫瞎咕哝 然后期望他… 
or grunt at my husband and hope

你说"不错"是什么意思？
what do you mean reasonably well?

完整掌握多斯拉克语的发音十分困难
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.

颤音和浊音太多了
So guttural and harsh.

卓戈说我的多斯拉克语说得像母语一样好

这让他深感庸耀

荣耀
Athjahakar.

勇耀
Athjahaka.

荣耀
Athjahakar.

荣耀
Athjahakar.

好吧 我有点疏于练习了
Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

您的高等瓦雷利亚语说的非常好 陛下
Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.

它是诸神创造的最完美的语言
The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.

只有它适合赋诗
It is the only proper language for poetry.

不许出声 否则她死定了
No screaming or she dies.

你想要什么？
What do you want?

你
You.

放开她
Let her go.

别尖叫哟 小可爱
Don't scream, lovely girl.

他们派你来杀我？
You were sent here to kill me?

为什么还不动手？
So why haven't you?

我不干了
I don't want to.

你的团长对此有何意见?
What do your captains have to say about that?

您自己问他们
You should ask them.

为什么？
Why?

我们对某个哲学问题有不同见解
We had philosophical differences.

什么问题？ 您的美貌
Over what? Your beauty.

对我来说这很重要 但他们不同意
It meant more to me than it did to them.

你这人真奇怪
You're a strange man.

我可是您见过的人当中最单纯的啦
I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.

只做自己想做的事
I only do what I want to do.

这个是用来取悦我的？
And this is supposed to impress me?

是啊
Yes.

为什么我要相信一个杀害自己同伴的人？
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?

他们命令我除掉你
They ordered me to murder you.

我说 我不想杀
I told them I preferred not to.

他们说我别无选择
They told me I had no choice.

我告诉他们我是达里奥・纳哈里斯
I told them I am Daario Naharis.

选择总是有的
I always have a choice.

他们拔剑
They drew their swords

我也拔剑
and I drew mine.

你愿意为我而战吗？
Will you fight for me?

宣誓吧
Swear to me.

次子团是您的 达里奥・纳哈里斯是您的
The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.

我的宝剑是您的 我的生命是您的
My sword is yours, my life is yours,

我的心也是您的
my heart is yours.

你真应该先敲门
You really ought to knock.

我把早餐端来了
I brought your breakfast.

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人事务官

天色暗了
It's getting dark.

我们在这里过夜吧
We could stay here for the night.

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿与妻子

生火到底能有多难?
How hard can it be to build a fire?

没关系
It doesn't matter.

到皮毛底下来 我们可以互相取暖
Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.

他刚刚朝我挤眼了
He winked at me before.

没有吧  我看到他朝我挤眼了
I doubt it. I saw him wink at me.

他只是眨了一下眼
He blinked.

挤眼和眨眼
I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference

这没有本质区别
between a wink and a blink.

什么区别？
A what?

呃 我是说 它们都一样
Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

挤眼是故意的
A wink is on purpose.

你真的没想过他的名字?
You thought of a name yet?

如果他有名字 涉及他的事说起来就容易多了
It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.

你说话有时那么讲究 是故意难为我？
Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?

什么？没有啊
What? No.

这就是我说话的方式
This is just the way I talk.

我来生火吧
I'll build that fire.

你真的不觉得该给他取个名字吗?
Don't you think he should have a name?

我知道的男孩名儿很少
I don't know many boys' names.

我想想
Let's see,

有邓肯
there's Duncan,

凯冯 琼恩
Kevan, Jon...

盖蒙
Guymon,

菲尔德 特里斯蒂芬
Feldan, Tristifer.

卡斯特
Craster.

哦 是的
Uh, yes.

但那个不太… 
Maybe that's not

莫尔蒙
Mormont.

这不错
That's a lovely idea,

但莫尔蒙是个姓
but Mormont's a last name.

为什么它是个姓？
Why is it a last name?

这么说吧 它是给一个家族用的
Well, it's a family name.

譬如 我叫山姆威尔・塔利
For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.

山姆威尔是我的名
Samwell is my birth name

塔利是我的姓
and Tarly is my family name.

明白了吗？所以我的父亲也是一个塔利
You see? So my father is also a Tarly.

他也叫山姆威尔・塔利？
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

不 他叫蓝道・塔利
No, Randyll Tarly.

蓝道是个好听的名字
Randyll is a handsome name.

千万别叫这孩子蓝道
Please don't name him Randyll.

你的父亲也像我的父亲一样残忍吗?
Is your father cruel like mine?

只是方式不同
Different manner of cruel.

那就不叫蓝道吧
Not Randyll, then.

别去
Don't.

不要出去
Don't go out there.

我马上回?
I'll be back.

我只想去看一下
I just want to look.

快进去
Go inside.

快进去 我… 
Go back inside. I'll

他是为了孩子来的
It's come for the baby.

不要过来
Stay back!

你不要过来！
You stay back!

不 你不能带走他！不要！
No, you can't have him! No!

不要！
No!
