快撤！
Fall back!

山姆威尔・塔利
守夜人事务官

兄弟？
Brother?

杰奥・莫尔蒙
守夜人总司令 “熊老”

渡鸦送出去了么？
Did you send the ravens?

看着我 塔利
Tarly, look at me.

渡鸦送出去了么？
Did you send the ravens?

“忧郁的”艾迪
守夜人事务官

雷斯特
守夜人

葛兰
守夜人游骑兵

那是你的职责
That was your job.

你唯一的职责
Your only job.

我们得回长城去
We need to get back to the Wall.

路途艰难
It's a long march.

我们知道将要面对什么
We know what's out there,

但是我们必须赶回 必须发出警报
but we have to make it,have to warn them

否则 在凛冬结束之前
or before winter's done,

所有你认识的人
everyone you've ever known

都会死
will be dead.

根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》改编
原著 乔治・R・R・马丁

叮当衫
野人 “骸骨之王”

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人事务官

耶哥蕊特
野人 “火吻而生”

你是第一次见到巨人吧 琼恩・雪诺？
First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?

不过可别盯太久 他们害羞得很
Well, don't stare too long.They're shy.

等害羞的劲儿过去了 他们可要生气了
When they stop being shy,they get angry.

等他们开始生气了
And when they're angry,

就会像砸钉子一样把人砸到地上
I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground

这可是我可亲眼见过的
like a hammer on a nail.

是乌鸦！ 乌鸦！
Crow! Crow!

看那边！ 乌鸦！
Look over there! Crow!

乌鸦！看呐！快看！
Crow! Look over here!Look!

啊 看呐 乌鸦过来了！
Ah, look, crow coming!

乌鸦！
Crow!

你穿错衣服了
You're wearing the wrong color.

曼斯曾经是个游骑兵
Mance was a ranger.

你们乌鸦从心底渴望自由飞翔
In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.

如果我成了自由人 是否有离开的自由？
When I'm free,will I be free to go?

乌鸦！ 乌鸦！
Crow! Crow!

当然可以
Sure, you will.

啊！
Oh!

但我也有猎杀你的自由
And I'll be free to kill you.

这帮小子无法无天
Got no respect, this lot.

因为他们犯错的时候可没有父亲扇他们耳光
Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.

他们的父亲怎么了？
What happened to their fathers?

有些死在你们这些乌鸦手上
Some of them were killed by crows like you.

脸色别这么难看啊 琼恩・雪诺
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

要是曼斯・雷德喜欢你 你自然可以多活一两天
If Mance Rayder likes you,you'll live another day.

要是他不喜欢… 
And if he don't...

托蒙德
 野人掠袭者 “巨人克星”

斯迪
 野人 瑟恩族的首领

我闻到了乌鸦的气味
I smell a crow.

我们杀了他的同伴
We killed his friends.

寻思着你可能想问这家伙点什么
Thought you'd want to question this one.

一只乌鸦宝宝能问出什么来？
What do we want with a baby crow?

这只乌鸦宝宝杀了断掌科林
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.

他想加入我们
He wants to be one of us.

那断手的杂种杀了我的朋友
That half handed cunt killed friends of mine.

身形都有你两倍大
Friends twice your size.

我父亲说过 只要你一剑穿心
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones

大个子和小个子一样 眨眼就死
if you put a sword through their hearts.

有不少小个子
Plenty of little men

想要拿剑穿了我的心
tried to put their swords through my heart.

如今他们的小骨头
And there's plenty of little skeletons

都被埋在林子里了
buried in the woods.

小子 你叫什么？ 琼恩・雪诺
What's your name, boy? Jon Snow.

陛下
Your Grace.

陛下？
Your Grace?

听见了没？
Did you hear that?

从今以后 我放屁的时候你们最好跪下来
From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.

起来吧 孩子
Stand, boy.

长城之外 我们不向任何人下跪
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.

那么 你就是奈德・史塔克的私生子
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

谢谢你的礼物 骸骨之王
Thank you for the gift,Lord of Bones.

你可以走了
You can leave us.

那姑娘喜欢你
The girl likes you.

你喜欢她么 雪诺？
You like her back, Snow?

你为了这个加入我们的？
That why you want to join us?

别慌张 小子
Don't panic, boy.

天杀的守夜人让你戒掉女色
This isn't the damned Night's Watch

咱们这儿可没这套
where we make you swear off girls.

刚才被你误认成我的那个在吃鸡的是“巨人克星”托蒙德
This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

我不相信
Can't believe this pup

这小崽子能杀了断掌
killed the Halfhand.

他是我们的敌人
He was our enemy

曼斯・雷德
 野人首领 “塞外之王”

他死了我很高兴
and I'm glad he's dead.

他曾是我的兄弟
He was my brother once.

那时他的手还没断
Back when he had a whole hand.

你怎么跟着他的？
What were you doing with him?

司令大人把我派到断掌手下锻炼
The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.

为什么？
Why?

他想让我有朝一日可以带兵上阵
He wants me to lead one day.

但你却在这里 成了叛徒
But here you are, a traitor

跪在塞外之王的脚下
kneeling before the King beyond the Wall.

如果我是叛徒 那你也一样
If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.

为什么要加入我们 琼恩・雪诺？
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?

我想要自由
I want to be free.

不 恐怕不是
No, I don't think so.

我看你真正想要的
I think what you want most of all

是逞英雄
is to be a hero.

我问你最后一次
I'll ask you one last time

为什么要加入我们？
why do you want to join us?

我们北上的时候停在卡斯特的堡垒
We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.

我看见… 
I saw...

你看见什么？
You saw what?

我看见卡斯特把他的亲生儿子
I saw Craster take his own baby boy

遗弃在森林里
and leave it in the woods.

我看见有东西带走了它
I saw what took it.

你说你看见它们中的一个？
You're telling me you saw one of them?

那么是什么让你舍弃了你的弟兄？
And why would that make you desert your brothers?

当我告诉司令大人的时候
Because when I told the Lord Commander,

他早已经知道了
he already knew.

千万年以前
Thousands of years ago, the First Men

先民曾跟异鬼战斗 而且击败了他们
battled the White Walkers and defeated them.

我想加入愿为生者而战的阵营
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.

我来对了么？
Did I come to the right place?

我们得给你找件新斗篷
We'll need to find you a new cloak.

波隆
佣兵

把那条布摘了怎么样？
What if you took off that bit there?

你就不打算留一点想象的空间？
Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?

问题是 我实在缺乏想象力
Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.

那你来脱好了
I want you to take it off.

用嘴
Mouth.

波隆爵士 波隆爵士
Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

我什么都没听见
I didn't hear that.

波德瑞克・派恩
提利昂的侍从

抱歉 爵士 退出去
Apologies, ser. Back away.

叫你往后退 退到屋子外面
Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment.

然后再后退一点 提利昂大人派我来
Then back away some more. Lord Tyrion sent me.

我要剁了你 小子
I will murder you, boy.

他说这事关乎生死
He said it was a matter of life and death.

波德？ 我是你姐姐
Pod? It's your sister.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

太后
The queen.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

他们来干嘛的？
What are they doing here?

算是保护我 不让我进去么？
Protecting me, I assume.Will you let me in?

不 你不能进来
No, I don't think so.

要是我想杀了你
If I wanted to kill you,do you think

你觉得这堵木头门能挡着我？
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

他们不能进来
They stay outside.

我不怕你 小弟弟
I'm not afraid of you,little brother.

你来干嘛？ 我来看看你的脸
Why are you here? I wanted to see your face.

听说你的鼻子没了 现在看来没那么恐怖
They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.

砍我鼻子的那个人没的可不止鼻子
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

但愿如此
I should hope so.

那些叛徒想要乔佛里的脑袋 却丢了他们自己的
The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.

都是父亲的功劳
Thanks to Father.

都是父亲的功劳
Thanks to Father.

当然，要杀我的可不是个叛徒
Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.

不是？怪了
No? Curious.

这国王之手的房间可真够寒酸的
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.

不过反正太大的房间你也用不着
But then I don't suppose you need much room.

大学士派席尔也这么取笑过我
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.

你肯定特别骄傲 能和蛋都垂到膝盖的老头一样招笑
You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.

你今天要跟父亲见面？
You're meeting Father today?

你怎么知道
How do you know that?

我有很多密探
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.

情报总管刚好欠我几个人情
The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.

父亲跟我说了 你到底想要什么？
Father told me. What do you want from him?

我要什么？ 他可是我父亲
What do I want from him? He's my father.

我用得着要什么吗？
Do I need to want something?

我相信他深爱我
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

就像任何一个父亲深爱他的
as any father loves his child,

宝贝儿子
his baby boy.

但是自从来到君临
Yet he hasn't come to visit once

他一次都没来看过我
since arriving in King's Landing.

我的脸被劈成两半 躺在床上奄奄一息
I lay here, my face split in half,

他都没来看过我
but Father never came.

说的我都要哭了
You're going to make me cry.

你为什么想知道我对他的要求？
Why do you care what I want from him?

因为你曾在父亲面前造谣
Because you've slandered me to Father before.

造谣？什么时候？
Slandered? When?

你跟他说我在凯岩城的时候
You told him I had my guards

曾命令卫兵殴打侍女
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

你确实让卫兵打了她
You did have your guards beat her.

一个只有九岁的小女孩
A girl of nine, I believe.

那会儿我也才九岁
I was nine, too.

我没记错的话 她为此瞎了一只眼
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

我没记错的话
If I remember correctly,

她以后再也不敢偷项链了
she never stole a necklace again.

事是真的，就不算造谣
It's not slander if it's true.

那你今天又想跟父亲说什么真话？
And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?

为什么我要跟父亲说的话
Why are you so nervous

会让你这么不安？
about what I'm going to say to Father?

因为你是个骗子
Because you're a liar.

你肯定会说我和乔佛里的坏话
I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

比如？
Any lies in particular?

你是挺聪明
You're a clever man,

但是比你自己想的可差远了
but you're not half as clever as you think you are.

那也比你聪明多了
Still makes me more clever than you.

看这俩金光闪闪的勇士哟
Oh, look at these two shining warriors.

特林・马兰爵士还有这个…
Ser Taryn Mant and...

谁他妈关心是什么骑士
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

马兰・特林
御林铁卫


马林・特兰 爵士
Ser Meryn Trant.

在下是黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

你不是骑士 波德
You're no knight. Pod.

黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater

可是国王陛下亲自册封的
was anointed by the king himself.

你不过是个一夜暴富的恶棍罢了
You're an up jumped cutthroat,

仅此而已
nothing more.

你说的没错
That's exactly who I am.

而你就是个穿着华丽盔甲的蛆
And you're a grub in fancy armor

比起打仗 我看你更擅长殴打小女孩
who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.

现在嘛，我跟提利昂大人约好了
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

你敢碰一下门
You put your hand on that door,

我就砍了你的手
you lose the hand.

我不仅享受阳光下的散步，大人
As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship,

还很想知道你为什么要叫我来
I am wondering why you sent for me.

这城市里想杀我的人不计其数
A number of people in this city want to kill me.

你却在保护我
You're here to protect me.

这活我可干了挺久
I've been doing that for a while now.

这活没让你变得人见人烦么
Do you grow bored protecting me?

这活只让我变穷了
I grow poor protecting you.

穷？ 穷？
Poor? Poor?

你可是在我的照顾下才成为骑士的
Under my patronage you've become a knight,

你现在都是都城守备队的队长了
you've served as Commander of the City Watch.

废话少说 你肯定没少中饱私囊
Briefly. I'm sure you filled your pockets.

现在我可是身无分文
And now my pockets are empty.

你是让我尝了点甜头
You've given me a taste for the finer things.

不过你要是还想继续被保护的话
And if you want me to carry on protecting you,

就得出更高价才行
you'll need to pay more.

我还以为咱俩是朋友呢 确实是
I thought we were friends. We are.

可我是个佣兵 我的武力是用来出售的
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.

可不是用来帮朋友的
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

开价吧 双倍
How much? Double.

双倍？ 我现在可是骑士了
Double? I'm a knight now.

骑士可值双倍的价儿
Knights are worth double.

我连自己现在正付你多少都不知道
I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.

这正说明你完全付得起
Which means you can afford it.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
洋葱骑士

这儿，在这儿！
Here. Here!

救救我！
Help me!

你是谁？
Who are you?

我曾参与过黑水河之战
I was in the battle at Blackwater.

我是个船长，也是个骑士
I was a captain and a knight.

爵士，你效忠哪个国王？
Aye, ser, and serving which king?

维斯特洛唯一的真王 
The one true king of Westeros 

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
Stannis Baratheon.

我还以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

大家都是这么想的
Everyone thought you were dead.

萨拉多・桑恩
里斯海盗

你儿子呢？
And your son?

他可能像你一样游上岸了
He may have swam ashore as you did.

没有，我眼睁睁看着他死于野火
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

我很遗憾，老友
I'm so sorry, my friend.

我也曾失去一个儿子
I, too, have lost a son.

这是世界上最糟糕的事儿
There is nothing worse in this world.

不过，戴佛斯，你是个好父亲
But, Davos, you were a good father.

如果我真的是好父亲，他就不会死
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

史坦尼斯还活着？
Stannis lives?

他在龙石岛舔伤口呢
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

你会带我过去吗？
Will you take me there?

龙石岛对我来说啥都不剩了
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

战争还没结束
This war is not over.

对你来说，也许
Not for you, maybe.

但是对于萨拉多・桑恩 战争到此为止了
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

我们都曾宣誓效忠于史坦尼斯陛下
We're both sworn to King Stannis.

我不效忠于任何人
I am sworn to no man.

我承诺提供30艘船，你们则承诺给我荣华富贵
I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.

我给了船
I delivered the ships.

史坦尼斯从不放弃 从不
Stannis never gives up. Never.

他将从新组织…  他已经输了
Now he will regroup He's a broken man.

他的舰队在黑水湾全军覆没
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

据说他谁都不见… 
They say he sees no one 

他的将士 甚至他的妻子
not his generals, not even his wife.

只剩下那个红袍女
Only the Red Woman

在他耳边瞎嘀咕
whispering in his ear,

鬼扯些火焰中的影像
telling him what she sees in the flames

要不就是火烧大活人
and burning men alive.

什么？
What?

史坦尼斯归来后点了场大火
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.

所有反对她的人都被称为
All those who spoke against her she called

暗黑仆人
servants of darkness.

传说她边吟唱边烧那些人
They say she sang to them as they burned.

我是个海盗
I'm a pirate.

你是个走私贩子
You're a smuggler.

暗黑仆人
Servants of darkness.

我倒觉得龙石岛才是我们得避开的地方
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.

带我回去，求你
Take me back there, please.

你又不能让史坦尼斯反对她
You cannot turn Stannis against her.

也许不能，但是我可以杀了她
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

你可以试试看
You could try.

要是失败了，他们会烧了你
If you fail, they will burn you.

要是成功了，他们还是会烧了你
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

而你才刚捡了条命
And you've only just come back to life.

再活久点儿吧，老友
Stay alive a little longer, my friend.

你叫我老友，你我在我婚礼上喝得大醉一场
You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.

你还跟我在我的4次婚礼上大醉4场呐
And you drank with me on four of my wedding days,

可我从没求你帮过忙
but I don't ask you for favors.

我必须阻止她
I have to stop her.

求你了，帮我这个忙
Please, do this for me.

你要是死了
When you are dead,

我就把你的骨头装在个小袋子里
I will gather your bones in a little sack

好让你那可怜的寡妇挂在脖子上
and let your widow wear them around her neck.

我们得在距离赫伦堡1000米的地方设下包围圈
We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡伯爵

不用包围 魔山守不了一片废墟
There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

我想只要泰温・兰尼斯特下令
I imagine the Mountain will defend

不管是哪魔山都会抵抗到底
whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.

自从牛津之战后 兰尼斯特就一直在和我们捉迷藏
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.

我想战斗 男人都想要场光明正大的战斗
I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.

恐怕咱们是得不到了
I don't think we're going to get one.

瑞卡德・卡史塔克
卡霍城伯爵

200个北方人被人像羊一样屠宰
200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.

这命债我们一定要讨回来，朋友
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

为了他们，也为了你的儿子
For them and for your sons.

是么？
Will it?

他们在泥巴里腐烂
They rot in the ground

凶手却逃之夭夭
while their killer runs free.

弑君者不会自由很久的
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.

我已经派出最好的人去追他了
My best hunters are after him.

凯特琳・徒利
罗柏・史塔克之母

一个梅利斯特？ 杰米爵士
A Mallister? Ser Jeremy.

我父亲的人
My father's bannerman.

找间屋子把她关起来
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.

泰丽莎
瓦兰提斯女护士

她是你母亲
She's your mother.

她放跑了詹姆・兰尼斯特
She freed Jaime Lannister.

兰尼斯特夺走了他们的儿子
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons

而她，则夺走了他们的正义
and she robbed them of their justice.

水
Water.

水
Water.

这伤口需要清洗缝合
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

你叫什么，朋友？
What's your name, friend?

科本
Qyburn.

你能活下来真幸运
You're lucky to be alive.

幸运？
Lucky?

…可能需要长时间依赖这些补给直到…

…等到时机成熟…就会…

猎获众多者赏…我…

…想在我们的地盘上捡漏…

…可能会持续很久 我们必须猎获足够数量以填补…

…先发制人…扫荡整片森林…

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

你带着这徽章挺合适
The badge looks good on you.

差点就比我带着还合适了
Almost as good as it looked on me.

这新职位让你挺享受的？
Are you enjoying your new position?

我像是在享受？
Am I enjoying it?

我当国王之手的时候可开心了
I was very happyas Hand of the King.

是的
Yes.

我听说了
I heard how happy you were.

你把妓女都带到我床上去了
You brought a whore into my bed.

那会儿还不是你的床呢
It wasn't your bed at the time.

我把你送来是辅佐国王的
I sent you here to advise the king.

我给了你真正的权力和职位
I gave you real power and authority.

而你却选择
You chose to spend your days

同以往一样
as you always have,

和妓女鬼混
bedding harlots

和小偷共饮
and drinking with thieves.

有时我也和妓女共饮
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

提利昂 你到底想要什么？
What do you want, Tyrion?

为什么人人都以为我意有所图
Why does everyone assume I want something?

我就不能只是想来看看亲爱的老爸吗？
Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?

我这个亲爱的老爸
My beloved father who

在儿子英勇负伤之后
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son

不知怎么的忘记来看儿子了
after he fell on the battlefield.

派席尔大学士保证你的伤势不致命
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.

当你在赫伦堡的废墟上忙着开会时
I organized the defense of this city

是我组建了这座城市的防御
while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.

敌人军临城下时 是我领军迎战
I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate

而你的外孙 国王陛下
while your grandson, the king,

却躲在城墙后面发抖
quivered in fear behind the walls.

我为了家族血染沙场
I bled in the mud for our family.

而下场呢
And as my reward,

却是被丢进个小黑牢里
I was trundled off to some dark little cell.

可是我想要什么呢？
But what do I want?

一点该死的感激会是一个不错的开始
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

戏子和歌手才需要喝彩
Jugglers and singers require applause.

你是个兰尼斯特
You are a Lannister.

每次我在战场上负伤
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses

你以为只要塞我个玫瑰花环就行了吗
every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?

嗯？
Hmm?

如今 我有七国要料理
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after

其中三地正公然叛乱
and three of them are in open rebellion.

直说你到底想怎么样吧
So tell me what you want.

我想要我应得的
I want what is mine by right.

詹姆是你的大儿子理应继承你的领土和头衔
Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.

但他是御林铁卫不能娶妻也没有继承人
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

詹姆从披上白袍那天起
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,

就自动放弃了对凯岩城的继承权
he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

而我是你的儿子 是你法定的继承人
I am your son and lawful heir.

你想要凯岩城？
You want Casterly Rock?

它本就属于我
It is mine by right.

我们会给你找个和你的名头
We'll find you accommodations

更相称的封地
more suited to your name

当作是在黑水湾一战中
and as a reward for your accomplishments

对你战功的褒奖吧
during the battle of Blackwater Bay.

时机成熟之后 再给你安排个
And when the time is right, you will be given a position

既合适你发挥才智
fit for your talents

又维护我们声誉的职务
so that you can serve your family

维护我们的名望
and protect our legacy.

你要是干得好
And if you serve faithfully,

还能得到一名适合你的妻子
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

我宁愿被蛆虫吃光
And I would let myself be consumed by maggots

也不会玷污家族名誉
before mocking the family name

把凯岩城交给你
and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

为什么？ 为什么？
Why? Why?

你居然还问我这个？
You ask that?

你 你这个害死母亲而出世的人？
You, who killed your mother to come into the world?

你这个怪胎 畸形 不听话的主
You are an ill made, spiteful little creature

心中装满妒忌 淫欲缠身 尽耍小聪明
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

世人的律法让你冠我的姓氏 穿我的衣服
Men's laws give you the right to bear my name

因为我无法证明你不是我的种
and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

诸神为了教导我谦逊之道 迫使我
And to teach me humility,the gods have condemned me

目睹你佩着雄狮纹章 四处蹒跚招摇
to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion

那可是我父亲的纹章 我祖父的纹章！
that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.

但无论诸神还是世人
But neither gods nor men

都不能强迫我把凯岩城交给你
will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock

让它变成你的妓院
into your whorehouse.

滚，马上
Go, now.

再也休提凯岩城的继承权
Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.

滚
Go.

哦 还有一件事
Oh, one more thing.

下次教我在你床上发现妓女 我就吊死她
The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.

多恩 它往多恩去
Dorne.It's going to Dorne.

为什么要去多恩？它载着丝绸而去
Why Dorne? It's carrying silk

还有一场战争要打

以后每次看到这个骑士
Whenever you look at this knight,

我希望你会想起你父亲

他不是骑士

主持正义 保护弱小

Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?

那织工 刺绣 还有那金属饰品

我从来没见过像这个一样的衣服

当你做了王后 你会发现身着一点护甲总是有用的

说不定很快你就会体会到
once you become queen.Perhaps before.

乔佛里告诉我今天早上从圣堂返回的时候
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom

你在跳蚤窝下轿了
on your way back from the sept this morning.

总主教大人向我提到过的

在高庭的时候玛格丽就为穷人们做过很多事
Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.

即便是最底层的百姓 只要敞开心扉接触他们

你会发现他们和贵族没有区别
and approach them with an open heart.

敞开心扉？在跳蚤窝如果你不小心的话
An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom

只会被“敞开心脏”
if you're not careful, my dear.

不久前那里就曾有暴徒袭击我们
Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.

带着充足的护卫也没能阻止他们
We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.

国王都差点丧命
The king barely escaped with his life.

我母后向来喜欢夸大其辞
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.

随着她年龄渐长
Facts become less and less important to her

越来越夸张了
as she grows older.

暴徒根本没有威胁到我们的安全
Our lives were never truly in danger.

当然 你是对的
You're right, of course.

但你是你父亲的儿子
But you are your father's son.

其他人可没有国王的勇敢
We can't all have a king's bravery.

饥饿会把人变成野兽

I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.

他们告诉我有100辆从河湾地而来的货车近日就会到达君临

援助都城是我们的责任
in time of need.

既然如洛拉斯爵士所说
Well, as Ser Loras said,

玛格丽小姐以前就做过这种...
Lady Margaery has done this sort of...

慈善活动
charitable work before.

我想她应该知道自己在做什么
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

当然
I'm sure she does.

这些无垢者已经在这里站了整整一天一夜
The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night

不吃不喝
with no food or water.

他们还将一动不动站到死亡来临
They will stand until they drop.

我们称之为“顺从”
Such is their obedience.

弥桑黛
奴隶翻译

克拉兹尼・莫・纳克罗兹
阿斯塔波的奴隶主

他们应该符合我的要求
They may suit my needs.

告诉我他们是怎么训练的
Tell me of their training.

维斯特洛女人对他们很满意

但没有赞扬 以便压价

她想知道无垢者是如何被训练的

告诉她她该知道的 笼统点

天气太热了

他们五岁起接受训练
They begin their training at five.

每天从黎明一直练到天黑
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk

直到熟练掌握短剑
until they have mastered the shortsword,

盾牌和三种长矛
the shield, and the three spears.

四个男孩里只有一个存活
Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.

他们绝对服从 绝对忠诚
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.

并且全无恐惧
They fear nothing.

最勇敢的人也害怕死亡
Even the bravest men fear death.

骑士说最勇敢的人也害怕死亡

告诉那老头 他闻上去浑身尿臭

真这样说 主人？

当然不能这样说

你是女人还是母羊 问得出这么愚蠢的问题

我的主人说无垢者不是人
My master says the Unsullied are not men.

死亡对他们而言不算什么
Death means nothing to them.

告诉这无知的西方婊子

让她睁开狗眼

他请您留心观察 陛下
He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.

告诉善主大人 不必如此
Tell the good master there is no need.

她还操心他们的乳头？

这愚蠢的婊子知不知道他们的卵蛋已经被割了？

我的主人说男人不需要乳头
My master points out that men don't need nipples.

好了，到此为止

小人很高兴为主人效劳

在赢得尖刺盔之前
To win his shield,

无垢者必须拿一枚银币去奴隶市场
an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark,

找到一个哭叫着的新生儿 并在其母眼前将其杀死
find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.

我的主人说 通过这样的方法
This way, my master says,we make certain

方能确定他心中未留有丝毫软弱之处
there is no weakness left in them.

你们从母亲怀中抢走婴儿
You take a babe from its mother's arms,

在她注视之下将其杀死 然后支付一枚银币以补偿她的痛苦？
kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

她很生气

她问是不是支付一枚银币给那母亲

作为新生儿的价钱

这唠唠叨叨的婊子真是个软心肠的蠢货

我的主人告诉您
My master would like you to know that the silver is paid

钱乃是付给孩子的主人 不是给母亲
to the baby's owner, not the mother.

你们有多少无垢者待售？
How many do you have to sell?

8,000
8,000.

告诉这维斯特洛婊子她要在明天之前决定

克拉兹尼主人请您速做决定
Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.

对无垢者感兴趣的买家很多
Many other buyers are interested.

8,000个死去的新生儿
8,000 dead babies.

无垢者是终结一切的工具
The Unsullied are a means to an end.

如果我买了他们 这些人
Once I own them, these men 

他们不是人 不再是人了
They're not men. Not anymore.

如果我拥有一支奴隶军队 我成了什么？
Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?

您想 这些奴隶属于您或者克拉兹尼和他那样的人
Do you think these slaves will have better lives

谁会给他们更好的生活呢？
serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?

你对他们更加公正
You'll be fair to them.

你不会为了达到目的让他们残疾
You won't mutilate them to make a point.

也不会命令他们杀死新生儿
You won't order them to murder babies.

你会保证他们有吃有穿
You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.

他们已经经受了严重的不公正待遇
A great injustice has been done to them.

闭上双眼也不会有任何改变
Closing your eyes will not undo it.

是男巫们
The warlocks.

我欠您一条命 先生
I owe you my life, ser.

我深感荣幸
The honor is mine,

女王陛下

I know him

他是七国最强大的战士
as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

以及劳勃・拜拉席恩的御前侍卫队长

劳勃国王已经死了

我找了您很久 丹妮莉丝・风暴降生
I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

我想请求您的宽恕
to ask your forgiveness.

我曾发誓保卫你的家族

I failed them.

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
前任御林铁卫队长

我是巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
I am Barristan Selmy,

你父亲的御前侍卫
Kingsguard to your father.

请允许我加入你的御前侍卫
Allow me to join your Queensguard

我不会再次辜负你
and I will not fail you again.
