第五季第九集   The Dance of Dragons
魔龙的狂舞

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

小心啊！ 着火了！着火了！
Look out! Fire! Fire!

大概二十个人 也许还不到这个数
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

就这么潜入撤出 无人察觉
They were in and out before anyone spotted them.

烧尽了我军的粮草
Burnt our food stores to the ground,

焚毁了我军的攻城武器
all our siege weapons destroyed.

数十顶营帐被…  马呢？
Dozens of tents wereHorses?

我们还在清点中 但死了有好几百匹
We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.

二十人骑马闯入我军营帐 卫兵都没有警示？
20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?

北方佬一直比我们更了解他们的地盘
The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.

把昨晚的卫兵给我铐起来
Put last night's guards in chains.

他们要么就是贪睡偷懒玩忽职守 要么就是内奸通敌
Either they fell asleep or they conspired with the enemy.

查明真相后悉数绞死 陛下
Find out the truth and then hang them. Your Grace.

除非冰雪融化 不然我们无法向临冬城推进
Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell

戴佛斯·席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

我们也没有足够的粮草撤退回黑城堡
and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.

我们不会撤退回黑城堡
We're not returning to Castle Black.

史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩
长城上的王

恕我直言 陛下 我虽然打仗不在行
Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters,

但如果我军没法前进 又不愿后退… 
but if we can't march forward and we won't march back...

让人把死马剁了吃肉吧
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

赛丽丝·佛罗伦
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩之王后

琼恩·雪诺
守夜人总司令

停！
Halt!

停！
Halt!

到了！
There it is!

艾里沙·索恩
守夜人游骑兵

艾迪森·托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪”  守夜人事务官

打开城门
Open the gates.

我失败了
It was a failure.

你没有失败
It wasn't.

山姆威尔·塔利
“杀手”   守夜人事务官

我本是去营救他们 结果却失败了
I went to save them. I failed.

你救了他
You didn't fail him.

还有他
Or him.

还有她
Or her.

全靠你 这些人才幸免于难
Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else.

我想他们可不会忘了这一点
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

波文·马尔锡
守夜人首席事务官

温旺·威格·温旺·铎迩·温旺
巨人 简称旺旺

奥利
守夜人新兵

你挺好心的嘛 琼恩·雪诺
You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

好到会把我们都害死
It'll get us all killed.

别挡道
Out of my way.

您召见我 陛下？
You sent for me, Your Grace?

你去选几匹良驹 甄选骑士作为护卫
Find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you.

我要派你回黑城堡
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

传令给守夜人总司令
Tell the Lord Commander his king commands him

叫他运送粮草 补给 跟新饲养的马过来
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

作为回报 待我夺回铁王座
In return, when I take the throne,

定会保证守夜人如愿以偿 有足够的人力
I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires.

守卫长城边上的的十九座城堡
He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall if he so wishes.

陛下 您已任命我为国王之手
Your Grace, you named me your Hand.

没错
Yes.

国王之手应不离御前
The King's Hand should never abandon the king,

尤其在战争时期
especially in time of war.

你这并非离弃君主 而是奉命行事
You're not abandoning me. You're obeying a command.

这个指令派个小男孩拿着卷轴就能传达
A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.

但倘若琼恩·雪诺拒绝来使
And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll,

这个小男孩该如何应对？
what does the boy say?

你被任命国王之手并非因为能征善战
I didn't name you Hand for your expertise in military matters.

策马前往黑城堡 别空着手回来
Ride for Castle Black. Don't come back emptyhanded.

陛下 或许赛丽丝王后
Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse

和席琳公主能与我同行
and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

我的家人与我同在
My family stays with me.

至少让我带走席琳公主
At least let me take Shireen.

小女孩在战场上太危险了
A siege is no place for a little girl.

我的家人与我同在
My family stays with me.

希琳·拜拉席恩

在看什么书？
What's this one now?

《魔龙狂舞真史》
"The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling"

由大学士慕昆撰写
by Grand Maester Munkun.

听起来挺适合这个时候看的
Now that sounds like a proper story.

拜伦·史文爵士试图杀死巨龙瓦格哈尔。
Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.

他用一周把盾牌打磨得光滑如镜
He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror.

他蹲伏在盾后 悄然前行
And he crouched behind it and crept forward,

寄希望于巨龙只能看到自身的倒影
hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.

那头龙却看到了一个手持镜盾的蠢蛋
But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.

就把他烤成了肉卷
And burnt him to a crisp.

拜伦·史文爵士的屠龙冒险
Thus ending the dragonslaying career

到此为止了
of Ser Byron Swann.

我做了东西给您 公主殿下
I made you something, Princess.

喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

他真美
He's beautiful.

谢谢 乐意为您效劳
Thank you. You're very welcome.

您能再做个母鹿的给我吗？这样他就能有个伴了
Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company?

当然可以
Of course I will.

但为什么要送我礼物？
But why am I getting a present?

因为我本来就应向您道谢
Because you deserve it.

我儿子以前总是催我 想教我识字
My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read.

七神在上 我太顽固了不肯学
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

我到了现在的地位却不识字
Made it this far without reading.

本以为我可能到死前都不认字了
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

多希望我当初听了他的话
Wish I'd listened to him.

这是我唯一能向您表示感激的方法
This is my own poor way of saying thank you.

让我不再盲目无知
For teaching me to be a grownup.

我会离开几天 公主殿下
I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.

等我回来时 想听您给我讲《魔龙狂舞》的所有故事
I want to hear all about "The Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.

您得自己读啦
You'll read it yourself.

How's your jaw?

崔斯丹·马泰尔
道郎亲王之子

弥赛菈·拜拉席恩

只是被跳蚤咬了一口
A fleabite.

您来多恩有何贵干？
What are you doing in Dorne?

艾德莉亚·沙德
红毒蛇的情妇

来确保我外甥女弥赛菈的安全
Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella.

不派渡鸦送信 也不直接给我报告
And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly,

道朗·马泰尔
多恩亲王

就这么直接潜入多恩领土
you decided to enter my country in secret

强行掳走我们的贵宾？
and abduct our guest by force?

我们接到了恐吓信
We received a threatening message.

公主的项链放在蛇的颚上被送来
The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.

项链是从我的房里被偷走的
That necklace was stolen from my room.

噢 太棒了
Oh, excellent.

斩首前最后的盛宴？
A last meal before the beheading?

噢 我不能斩了你
Oh, I can't behead you.

众多多恩子民想要向铁王座宣战
Many in Dorne want war.

但我曾目睹战争惨状
But I've seen war.

曾直视沙场上横尸遍野
I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields.

曾眼见孤儿挨饿濒死
I've seen the orphans starving in the cities.

我并不想把我的子民卷入这样的人间地狱
I don't want to lead my people into that hell.

你当然不想 你想与兰尼斯特家族同餐共饮
No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.

正是如此
And that is precisely what we are doing.

让我们举杯 敬托曼一世
Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name,

安达尔人和先民的国王
King of the Andals and the First Men,

七国统治者
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

托曼陛下坚持
King Tommen insists

要他姐姐回君临吗？
on his sister's return to the capital?

怕是如此
I'm afraid he does.

国王下令 我惟有听命
I cannot disobey my king's command.

她会随你回到君临
She will return with you to King's Landing.

还有崔斯丹王子陪伴左右
And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both.

若要确保铁王座和多恩的盟约不破
If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

联姻必须维持
their engagement must stand.

同意
I accept.

还有一事 我弟弟在世时
One more thing. My brother was named

在御前议会曾有一席之地
to the small council before his death.

令尊深知拉拢多恩
Your father understood the importance

是多么重要
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

死者已矣 崔斯丹应该接替奥柏伦进入御前议会
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.

一言为定
You have my word.

弑君者的诺言
The word of a kingslayer.

怪不得你没法站起来 你压根儿没有脊梁
No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.

你是我四个侄女的母亲
You are mother to four of my nieces,

我很爱他们
girls I love very much.

因此我希望你的人生也长寿美满
For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life.

再敢这么跟我说话 你就不会拥有这样的人生
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

我能问问随我同来的波隆会有怎样的命运么？
May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn?

告诉我 詹姆爵士 在君临
Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing,

草民袭击王子该当何罪？
how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?

他说那只是被跳蚤咬了一口
He said it was just a fleabite.

有错的是我
The fault is mine.

波隆只是个听命办事的马前卒罢了
Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders.

如果非要罚的话 就罚我吧
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

崔斯丹王子日后若要统御就该学会识人断事
Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day.

我由他作决定
I'll let him decide.

我从父亲那里学到了仁慈的可贵
I have learned the value of mercy from my father.

我给你的人自由 你心真善
 I'll set your man free. You're a good man.

但有个条件
On one condition.

波隆
骑士

还玩什么呢？我比你厉害
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

娜梅莉亚·沙德
红毒蛇的私生女

特蕾妮·沙德
红毒蛇的私生女

永远比你厉害
I'll always be better than you.

我有哪次打不中的？
Have I ever missed once?

据我所知 一次都没有哦
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

你一定很喜欢被羞辱 要么就是喜欢疼
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

你更爱哪个 羞辱还是疼？
Which do you love most, humiliation or pain?

那一下肯定很痛 对不对？
That one hurt, didn't it?

你不会要哭了吧？
You going to cry?

放弃吧 小妹
Give up, little sister.

你马上就要打空了 我从不打空
You're going to miss. Oh, I never miss.

你会的 你想得太多了
You will. You're thinking too much.

现在你紧张了 她要是说对了怎么办？
Now you're nervous. What if she's right?

运气罢了 现在轮到我了
Luck. Now it's my turn.

你出手太慢了
You're too slow.

总是那么慢
You've always been too slow.

走了这一遭 我能如愿吗？
Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk?

你很快就知道了
You'll find out very soon.

再说一遍 帅哥
Say it one more time, handsome.

我是谁？
Who am I?

世上最美的女子
The most beautiful woman in the world.

你说的一点没错
And that's the truth.

小淫娃
Slut.

奥芭娅·沙德
红毒蛇的私生女

道朗亲王
Prince Doran,

黑水河的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

我没听说过还有什么黑水河的爵士
I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater.

世上独一无二
Only the one.

我想你早已见过崔斯丹王子
I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.

王子
Prince.

那天多有冒犯了
Sorry about the other day.

崔斯丹王子宅心仁厚
Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.

他同意赐你自由
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

听到这个我很高兴
I'm glad to hear it.

馅饼看着不错
Pie looks good.

但还有个条件
There was one condition.

还是喝点汤吧
Perhaps some soup instead.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇...
Oysters, clams, and cock

你的小蛤蜊卖几个钱啊？
How much for your little clam?

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

牡蛎 蛤蜊 还有扇贝
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

艾莉亚·史塔克
黑白之院的学徒

过来
Come on.

来点牡蛎 丫头！
Some oysters, girl!

我在叫你呢
I'm talking to you.

哎
Is, uh...

丫头！ 系住船！
Girl!  Tie her up!

你聋了么？丫头！
Are you deaf? Girl!

丫头！
Girl!

公爵大人
My lord.

公爵大人
My lord.

提利尔公爵
Lord Tyrell.

作为铁银行的代表
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

楚泰·奈斯托斯
铁金库代言人

我先行前来欢迎您
may I be the first to welcome you

来到自由贸易城邦布拉佛斯
to the Free City of Braavos.

希望您的旅途没有太多劳顿
I hope your journey was troublefree.

梅斯·提利尔
高庭公爵 玛格丽·提利尔之父
财政大臣

前两天碰上了点小麻烦
A bit of chop the last few days.

没什么大不了的
Nothing too awful.

马林·特兰
御林铁卫

看到老伙计还镇守着港湾我就放心了
Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor.

河湾地的收成怎样？
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

啊 酒商们说今年大概是
Ah, the vintners say this might be

半个世纪以来红葡萄收成最好的一年了
the best year for red grapes in half a century.

如果我们能达成协议
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

我一定送上一桶青亭岛最好的佳酿
I'll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

恐怕我得谢绝
I'm afraid I don't partake.

噢
Oh.

有人说高利贷生意沾满铜臭 下流不誉
Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable.

当然是一派胡言
Pure nonsense, of course.

很高兴我们看法一致
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

你知道吗？梅葛三世曾一度
Did you know that at one point Maegor the third

想在七国全境立法禁止高利贷
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

还想逮捕借贷谋利的人
Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest

砍掉他们的双手
and cut off both their hands.

手套商们可要冤死了
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

要是谁借款不收利息
If a man charges no interest on a loan,

那么他的账上只会有出无进
then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose,

谁会冒这险？
so why chance it?

而正是付息的承诺
Whereas the promise of reward

让人愿意放手一赌
makes a man willing to gamble.

提利尔公爵 我们铁银行可不是赌徒
We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

你们是这世上最厉害的赌徒
You are the world's best gamblers.

你们赢下的每一注最终造就了这个
And all those bets you won built this.

我们应该庆祝一下
We should celebrate.

恐怕我还有诸多要事在身
I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.

噢 算了吧 别管工作了 你会唱歌吗？
Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?

我没有那一项天赋 那可不是什么天赋
I don't have that gift. Oh, it's not a gift.

那是技能 大家都能学会的
It's a skill. Anyone can learn it.

? 你给我一吻在那长长的运河旁 ?
So give me a kiss by the Long Canal

? 又给我一吻在那海边的小镇上 ?
And give me two kisses in Salty Town

? 只因明日你我都将消亡 ?
For we're going to die tomorrow

? 光头的乞丐 和戴冠的国王 ?
The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown...

这老东西好像永远不知道闭嘴似的
Thought that old shit would never stop singing.

唱的倒是不赖
Wasn't bad, though.

提利尔家的人都可以在地狱里腐烂发臭了
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

叛逆的婊子
Treasonous cunts.

他们原本还要让那个基佬蓝礼当国王呢
They were going to make that boyfucker Renly king.

就是这儿了 小子们
This is the place, lads.

布拉佛斯最漂亮的貂皮
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

你要买吗？ 哦 我当然要买
You buying? Oh, I'm buying.

但我从来不擅长和人分享
But I never was good at sharing.

到别处卖你的鱼去
Sell your fish somewhere else.

噢 让她进来 布鲁斯科 我饿死了
Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

到这儿来 小甜心
Come here, sweetness.

人们都说牡蛎能让人汁水横流呢
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

我们买半打
We'll take half a dozen.

三个铜板
Three coppers.

就冲小姐喜欢你这点 给你一枚银币
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

太老了
Too old.

布瑞亚
Brea.

太老了
Too old.

我有最佳人选了 安娜拉
I have just the one. Anara.

我们这里最贵的小姐了
Our most expensive girl.

但绝对值了 我向你保证
But well worth it, I assure you.

太老了
Too old.

你到底有没有我想要的？
Do you have what I want or not?

当然 当然
Of course. Of course.

这些新鲜吗？
These fresh?

来吧 伙计们都饿坏了
Come on, the lads are hungry.

牡蛎用来壮阳再好不过了
Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters.

给 谢谢你  我要一个
Here. Thank you. I'll have one.

有醋吗？
Any vinegar?

谁让这女孩儿进来的？去！去！
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

很好
Good.

等我们完事我会通知你
I'll tell you when we're done.

明天你还有新的吗？
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

当然
Of course.

再不走我就打你了 小姑娘
I'll have you whipped, girl.

走 走开 去 出去
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

凡人皆有一死
Valar morghulis.

凡人皆有一死
Valar morghulis.

如何？
And?

那个瘦男人今天不饿
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

贾坤·赫加尔
无面者

或许这就是为啥某人那么瘦
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

明天
Tomorrow.

明天
Tomorrow.

女孩还有事要做
A girl has work to do.

你的叛乱结束了
Your rebellion is over.

你现在可以向我宣誓效忠… 
You can swear your allegiance to me now...

也可以选择去死
or you can die.

我相信人能改过
I believe in second chances.

但事不过三
I don't believe in third chances.

你写东西像七岁小孩
You write like a sevenyearold.

你们的学士非常乐意为我抄一份
Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.

他没要你钱？
He didn't try to make you pay?

嗯哼
Mmmmm.

或许他变了
Maybe he's changed.

皇后陛下得知你想带她的女儿回家定会十分激动
The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home.

没错
She will.

你非常爱她 不是么？
You love her very much, don't you?

当然 他可是我外甥女
Of course, she's my niece.

我不是说她
I wasn't talking about her.

你觉得我会反对吗？
You think I disapprove?

为什么？
Why?

就因为你们那儿的人都会反对你那档子事儿吗？
Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from?

他们会反对的是奥伯伦和我
They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from.

这里的人才不会管这些
Here no one blinked an eye.

一百年前
100 years ago,

如果你姓坦格利安
no one would have blinked an eye at you

没人会正眼瞧你
if you'd been named Targaryen.

我们应该去爱谁 我们不该去爱谁 总是在变
It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.

而唯一不变的
The only thing that stays the same

是我们究竟爱着谁
is that we want who we want.

我知道发生在我所深爱的男人身上的可怕事情
I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing

和你女儿毫无关系
that happened to the man I love.

或许这件事上连你都是无辜的
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

父亲
Father.

你不冷吗？
Aren't you cold?

不冷 你在读什么？
No. What are you reading?

“魔龙狂舞 ” 讲什么的？
"The Dance of Dragons." What's it about?

讲的是发生在雷妮拉·坦格利安
It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen

和他同父异母的弟弟伊耿之间为争夺七大王国控制权的战争
and her halfbrother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.

他们都认为铁王座属于自己
Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne.

当人们开始宣誓效忠其中的一方或另一方时
When people started declaring for one of them or the other,

他们的战争将七大王国一分为二
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

同胞相残 魔龙狂舞
Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.

当这一切结束的时候 几千人人死于非命
By the time it was over, thousands were dead.

而这对坦格利安家族来说同样是一场灾难
And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well.

他们从未真正恢复元气
They never truly recovered.

“魔龙狂舞 ”
"The Dance of Dragons."

这怎么会是“舞”呢？
Why is that a dance?

人们就是这么叫的
It's just what they call it.

嗯 这不太合情理
Hmm, doesn't make much sense.

我觉得还挺诗意的
I think it's poetic.

如果你一定要在雷妮拉
If you had to choose

和伊耿之间做出选择
between Rhaenyra and Aegon...

你会选择谁？
who would you have chosen?

我两边都不选
I wouldn't have chosen either.

就是选边站队才让事情发展得如此可怕
It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.

有时一个人必须做出选择
Sometimes a person has to choose.

有时整个世界逼迫他做出选择
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

如果这个人知道自己是谁...
If a man knows what he is...

并听从自己的内心...
and remains true to himself...

那么对他而言就根本不存在什么选择
the choice is no choice at all.

他必须完成他的使命… 
He must fulfill his destiny...

并成为他注定要成为的人
and become who he is meant to be.

不管他对此有多痛恨
However much he may hate it.

没事的 父亲
It's all right, Father.

你根本不知道我在说什么
You don't even know what I 'm talking about.

没关系
It doesn't matter.

我想帮你
I want to help you.

我有没有帮助你的方法？
Is there any way I can help?

是的 有
Yes, there is.

太好了 我想帮你
Good. I want to.

我是拜拉席恩家族的公主席琳
I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

我是你的女儿
And I'm your daughter.

原谅我
Forgive me.

我父亲在哪里？我要见我父亲
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

一切都会很快过去的 公主殿下
It will all be over soon, Princess.

不要
No.

我父亲在哪里？
Where's my father?

你不能这样做 父亲 您在哪儿？
No, you can't do this. Father, where are you?

让我见见他 求您了
Please, let me see my father.

父亲 您在哪儿？快阻止她
Father, where are you? Don't let her do this.

放开我！
Please let go!

我要见我的父亲！您在哪里？求求您！
Let me see my father! Where are you? Please!

这就是光之王想要的 别这样
It's what the Lord wants. No.

求求您 放开我！别这样！ 这是一件善举
 Please! Let go! No! It's a good thing.

伟大之举 停下来 停下来！
A great thing.  Stop. Stop!

求您了！ 光之王 倾听吾等
Please! Hear us now, my Lord.

你不能这样做！ 我们为您献上这名女孩
You can't do this! For you, we offer up this girl

求您了！ 请您用火焰净化她
Please! ...that you may cleanse her with your fire

使其光芒为我们指引道路
and that its light may lead our way.

求求您别这样 让我见见我的父亲
Please! No, please let me see my father.

如果不这样做 我们都会饿死在这里
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.

我们所有人
All of us.

但是一旦我们进行了这次献祭… 
But if we make this sacrifice...

光之王 请您接受我们的奉献
Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,

引领我们走出黑暗
and lead us from the darkness.

光之王 请您为我们指明道路 母亲！
Lord of Light, show us the way. Mother!

母亲 求求您！
Mother, please!

母亲 求求您 母亲！
Mother, please! Mother!

母亲！ 我们不能这样做
 Mother! We can't.

没有别的办法 她身上流着国王之血 求您别这样做！
There's no other way. She has king's blood. Please don't do this!

光之王 保护吾等
Lord of Light, protect us.

求求您 父亲 求求您！ 因为长夜漫漫 处处险恶
Please! Father, please! For the night is dark and full of terrors.

父亲！
Father!

父亲 别这样 求您了！
Father, don't do this! Please!

母亲 求求您 求求您 救救我！
Mother, no! Please! Please, help!

别这样做！
Don't do this!

求求您们 父亲 母亲 救命！
Please, Father! Mother, help!

弥桑黛
丹妮的侍女

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
“风暴降生” 弥林的女王

西茨达拉·佐·洛拉克
弥林贵族
丹妮莉丝的未婚夫

你去哪儿了？
Where have you been?

我只是去确保一切都井然有序
Just making sure everything is in order.

弥林的自由民们！

在诸位圣女的庇佑

以及女王陛下的恩泽之下

欢迎来到

大竞技场！

达里奥·纳哈里斯
次子团团长
丹妮莉丝的情人

女王陛下 由我向您介绍我们的第一项比赛

谁能胜出：

是更强壮的这位

还是更迅捷的这位？

我将为您的荣耀而战 直至死亡

伟大的女王陛下

我将为您的荣耀而战 直至死亡

伟大的女王陛下

他们在等您
They're waiting for you.

请您鼓掌
Clap your hands.

那边那个 小个子的家伙
That one, the smaller man.

毫无疑问你们应该下注赌他赢
No question, that's where you should put your money.

这儿可就有个小个子呢
The smaller man it is.

我没打算下注赌任何人赢
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

国王和王后从不参与角斗的下注
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

或许你应该去找个会赌的人说
Perhaps you should go find someone who does.

当我还在角斗场竞技的时候 人们总会赌我输
People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.

他肯定也会这样做 常见的新手错误
He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.

我在这竞技场里待得够久了
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

在我的经验里 大块头战胜小个子
And in my experience, large men do triumph

可比相反的状况要常见得多
over smaller men far more often than not.

你的经验包含了任何实战经历吗？
Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting?

我指的是你自己的？
You yourself?

你尝试过与另一个人生死相搏吗？
Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you?

每当我在竞技场里遇上像这种野兽的时候
Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one,

提利昂·兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”  丹妮的顾问

观众们看到那时还皮包骨头的我
the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then,

然后又看到那一坨打算干掉我的愤怒的肌肉
then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me.

全都争先恐后地一股脑下注去了
They couldn't get their money out fast enough.

但是那坨肌肉往往在这里
But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here

或者… 这里是没有肉的
or... here.

而且他们往往都太慢了
And the big men were always too slow

来不及阻止我的匕首刺进他们没有肉的地方
to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't.

没错 只要我看到站在我对面的是这样一头
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me

摆着恐怖表情的野兽 我就知道我可以回去好好休息了
making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.

你不喜欢这个？
You don't approve?

以我的标准来看 我见证过的死亡实在是有点多过头了
There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.

我希望在闲暇时间里能少见证一些
I can do without it in my leisure time.

有道理 尽管这是一个不太令人愉快的问题
Fair enough. Yet it's an unpleasant question,

但哪一项伟大的成就不是伴随着残忍和杀戮而达成的呢？
but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?

“是什么”和“应该是什么”总是容易混淆
It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be,

特别是当这种混淆对你的观点有利的时候
especially when what is has worked out in your favor.

我所说的和我自己无关
I'm not talking about myself.

我在讨论的是成就伟大的必要条件
I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.

那就是你说的“伟大”？
That is greatness?

那是弥林这座伟大的城市中至关重要的一部分
That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen,

在你我诞生之前它就早已存在
which existed long before you or I

而在我们化归尘土后仍会屹立不倒
and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

我父亲肯定会喜欢你
My father would have liked you.

让我们再问一遍 谁能胜出？

有朝一日 你那伟大的城市也会化归尘土的
One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

在你的命令之下？ 如果有这个必要的话
At your command? If need be.

一位弥林勇士？

如果这事发生 又有多少人会死呢？
And how many people will die to make this happen?

如果事情真的发展至此 他们至少算是死得其所
If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

那些人都认为他们自己死得其所
Those men think they're dying for a good reason.

他们得的是其他人的所
Someone else's reason.

所以您的理由是正确的 而他们的是错误的？
So your reasons are true and theirs are false?

他们并不像您了解他们一样了解自己？
They don't know their own minds, but you do?

说得好 你狡辩的本事不错
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

这并不代表你说得不对
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

根据我的经验 会狡辩的人和蠢货一样
In my experience, eloquent men are right

都是分寸不让 永远正确的呢
every bit as often as imbeciles.

还是一位维斯特洛骑士？

我将为您的荣耀而战 直至死亡

乔拉·莫尔蒙
“大熊” 被放逐的骑士

伟大的女王陛下

陛下…  住嘴
Your GraceShut your mouth.





你可以终止比赛 她不能
You can end this. She cannot.

你可以的
You can.

保护你们的女王！
Protect your queen!

快走！
Go!

陛下！陛下！
Your Grace! Your Grace!

跟我来 我知道一条出去的路
Come with me. I know a way out.

我知道… 
I know a way

跟紧了
Stay close.

走这边
This way.

到另外那边去
The other side.

跟我来
Follow me.

保护女王！
Protect your queen!

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的黑龙

飞吧
