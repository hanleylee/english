But this storm is a stroke of luck for us northerners.

我们的人习惯于在冰霜中作战

而他的军队正在外面承受风雪之苦
His army is out there now suffering in the snow.

A trueborn will always have the stronger claim.

我已经得到了皇家法令 国王...
I've been naturalized by a royal decree from

托曼·拜拉席恩？另一个私生子
Tommen Baratheon? Another bastard.

私生子也能登上高位

到临冬城前还有一段艰苦的路程
We still have a hard march to Winterfell

但在这样的天气下我们哪儿也去不了
and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.

然后呢？
And?

时机未到
This isn't our time.

雪停之后我们应该撤回黑城堡
We should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.

我从君临撤退过一次 戴佛斯爵士
I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos.

如果这次我又下令撤退 我就成了逃命王了
If I retreat again, I'll become the King Who Ran.

陛下... 凛冬将至
Your GraceWinter is coming.

这不仅仅是史塔克家的族语 这是现实
Those aren't just the Stark words. It's a fact.

若大军撤回黑城堡
If we march back to Castle Black,

我们就得在那里过冬
we winter at Castle Black.

然而谁又知道这个冬天
And who can say how many years

将会持续多少年？
this winter will last?

耐下心来韬光养晦总比孤注一掷好
It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything.

时机已到 必须孤注一掷了
This is the right time and I will risk everything.

否则我们已然败了
Because if I don't, we've lost.

我们将向着胜利进军

或向着毁灭进军
or we march to defeat.

但我们必须前进 只能前进
But we go forward. Only forward.

臣告退
Your Grace.

Are you sure?

我看见自己走过临冬城的城垛
I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell.

我看见剥皮人的旗帜弃掷一地
I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground.

来自长城北边的美人儿
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

你要去哪儿呀 可人儿？我们不比那胖墩长得俊吗？
Where you going, love? Aren't we betterlooking than the fat man?

不 问题是说她漂亮是以一个长城以南的女孩来说
No, the question is is she pretty down south in the real world

还是以这里唯一的女孩来说？
or is she pretty 'cause she's the only girl here?

就算在白港 我也很乐意吻她
Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

来吧 可人儿 给我们一个吻
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

让我一个人呆着
 Leave me alone.

哦 如果你是我的女孩 我可不会让你一个人呆着
Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone.

就吻一小下 来吧 给他一个吻
One little kiss. Come on, give him a kiss.

男儿守长城可寂寞了

手持烈焰长剑 阵斩五十人
slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.

他曾一战击杀伟大的卓戈卡奥

我听说弥林已经成了一座自由之城

您如果要去竞技场斗奴 会惹上麻烦的

达里奥·纳哈里斯
次子团团长

丹妮莉丝的情人

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母

我认为以他的智慧应该可以理解这一点
I think he's smart enough to understand that.

我认为鹰身女妖之子之所以停止杀戮
I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing

是因为他们的头领成了国王
because their leader was made king.

你在吃醋吗？
Are you jealous?

你认为我会可悲到要说
You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man

竞争对手的坏话？
just because he represents competition?

没错
I do.

你说对了
You're right.

我的动机可是相当的不纯呢
My motivations are entirely impure.

但不见得就错了
Doesn't make me wrong.

你跟我说过我没法对付敌人的里外夹攻
You told me yourself I can't fight enemies within and without.

所以当敌人不期而至
So when enemies without come knocking,

我需要弥林站在我这一边
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

我别无选择
I have no choice.

每个人都有选择
Everyone has a choice.

就连奴隶也是如此...
Even slaves have a choice

死亡或是受奴役
death or slavery.

嗯？那我又能做什么呢？
So what else can I do, hmm?

嫁给我吧
Marry me instead.

就算我真想做如此荒唐不智之事
Even if I wanted to do such an inadvisable thing,

我也不能
I couldn't.

为什么？
Why not?

你可是女王 你可以做你想做的任何事
You are queen. You can do what you like.

不 我不行
No, I can't.

那你就是弥林城内唯一没有自由的人儿了
Then you are the only person in Meereen who's not free.

我知道我的本分是侍奉女王 不是建言献策
And I know I'm here to serve my queen and not give advice,

但我能再多提一点建议吗？
but can I make one more suggestion?

当然
Of course.

在角斗大会开幕的当天
On the day of the great games,

把你能找到的所有伟主贤主善主
gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters

统统请来
and Worthy Masters you can find

一网打尽
and slaughter them all.

我是女王 不是屠夫
I am a queen, not a butcher.

统治者不为刀俎 就是鱼肉
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

那边的 我在哪儿才能找到总主教
You there. Where would I find the High Septon

要不就是大麻雀 还是别的什么愚蠢称号
or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

奥莲娜·提利尔
荆棘女王 玛格丽的祖母

我得承认 和荆棘女王相比这称号并不好
It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

跟一位贵妇说话的时候
You should have the decency

你该礼貌地站直身子
to stand when you speak to a lady.

 大麻雀
总主教

跟诸神说话的时候 你该礼貌地双膝下跪
You should have the decency to kneel before the gods.

小子 别和我贫嘴
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

我 膝盖不太好
For me, it's the knees.

你呢？ 屁股
You? Hips.

哈
Ah.

人民的臣仆 你的戏码就是这样？
A man of the people. Is that your game?

这戏路太老套了 既无聊又不可信
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

人民的臣仆
A man of the people

尽帮瑟曦做些肮脏勾当
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

人民一直做的都是脏活累活
The people always do the dirty work.

少在我面前狡辩 我一里外就能闻到谎言的味道
Spare me the homilies. I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

实用的天赋
Useful talent.

我为了我的孙子和孙女而来
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

你的孙子和孙女
Your grandson and granddaughter

立下的神圣誓言只是谎话
swore sacred vows and lied.

天父公正地审判所有人
The Father judges us all.

领主之子也好
Sons of high lords,

渔夫之子也罢
sons of fishermen.

只要你触犯了他的圣律 都将遭到惩罚
If you break his laws, you will be punished.

你怎么敢直接从我面前走开
Don't you walk away from me.

奥莲娜夫人 您无权在这儿发号施令
You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.

你到底想要什么？
What is it you want?

金子？
Gold?

我可以让你成为古往今来最富有的主教
I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.

又怎么了
What, then?

我想像得出这对你来说是件怪事
I imagine this is strange for you.

你见过的每一个人都有暗藏祸心
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive

而当你挖出它们来的时候 不免洋洋自得
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

但我却要告诉你一个简单的真相
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

我侍奉诸神
I serve the gods.

而诸神要求正义
The gods demand justice

他们怎么传达他们的要求
How do they communicate their demands?

用乌鸦啊还是用马啊
By raven or horse?

用神圣的经书《七星圣典》
By the holy text, "The SevenPointed Star."

如果您的书房里没有
If you don't have one in your library,

我可以把我的送您
I'll give you my own.

《七星圣典》我早读过了
I've read "The SevenPointed Star."

那您一定记得关于通奸和做伪证的那几段
Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury.

您的孙子和孙女将受惩罚
Your grandchildren will be punished

和任何触犯圣律的凡人一样
in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

这个肮脏的城市里
Half the men, women, and children

一半的男人、女人和孩子都触犯过圣律
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

你就活在杀手、窃贼和强奸犯之中
You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists,

可你却要惩罚洛拉斯
and yet you punish Loras

就因为他和喷了香水的男妓上床
for shagging some perfumed ponce

还有玛格丽 就因为她想维护自己的哥哥
and Margaery for defending her brother?

正是 诸神律法对众生一视同仁
Yes. The gods' laws must be applied to all equally.

如果你想要这种一视同仁 那好吧
If it's equality you want, so be it.

当提利尔家族停止向都城供给粮食的时候
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital,

所有人都会挨饿
everyone here will starve.

我保证 大家都会知道 这饥荒该怪到谁头上
And I'll make sure the hungry know who's to blame.

奥莲娜夫人 您播过种吗？
Have you ever sowed the field, Lady Olenna?

您割过麦吗？
Have you ever reaped the grain?

提利尔家族有任何人做过这些事吗？
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

一生的权力和富有
A lifetime of wealth and power

几乎蒙蔽了您的双眼
has left you blind in one eye.

您是寡 我们是众
You are the few, we are the many.

当众不惧寡之时… 
And when the many stop fearing the few...

奥莲娜夫人
Lady Olenna.

亲爱的 绝食并不能
Starving yourself won't make things

 托曼·拜拉席恩一世
铁王座上的王

帮她解决任何事情
any better for her, my love.

她正被关在牢房里
She's in a prison cell

而我却什么也做不了
and there is nothing I can do.

我是国王！
I am the king!

我的王后正被关在牢房里 而我却什么也做不了
The queen is in prison and there is nothing I can do!

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
太后

不管你是谁
No matter who you are,

不管你有多强大 迟早有一天
no matter how strong you are, sooner or later,

你都要面对一些自己无法控制的状况
you'll face circumstances beyond your control.

我照她说的做
I did what she said.

我履行了我的责任 现在她又要逼我回去？
I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?

你的手怎么样了

好极了

如果离开多恩的时候身上没多个疤 那我浑身都会觉得不对劲

我不急
No great hurry.

多恩女人是世上最美的女人
Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.

谢谢
Thank you.

我说多恩女人 没说你
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

我难道不是你见过的最美的女人吗

七大王国里

我见过不少女人
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

说说 有哪一个比我更美

有个什么样的？
There was a what?

你刚刚说 在君临
In King's Landing, you were saying?

我这么说了吗？
Was I?

你说有个女人比我更美

你的鼻子在流血

我的匕首涂有一层亚夏的毒药

我很抱歉 挑了这么个地方 你才不抱歉
I'm sorry about the locale. No, you're not.

这里感觉上是最安全的地方
It felt like the safest place.

但显然对你的主顾们来说并非如此
Not for your clientele, clearly.

这跟其他地方不一样
It was an establishment like no other.

它是为了迎合欲望而生的
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

而如果我们不把它言明的话
Desires that didn't even exist

欲望就不算存在
until we invented them.

你总是自我感觉相当良好 是不是
You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?

过去的就过去了

未来才有讨论价值

提利尔家族的未来

或者我的孙辈还有我

我向你保证 我向你保证 贝里席大人

我们的命运紧密相关
that our fates are joined.

我们合谋杀死了国王
Together we murdered a king.

一旦我的家族倾覆 我就无需掩饰任何事情
If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide.

而一旦我在你这破烂妓院里
And if I should meet with some accident

遭遇什么事故的话
here at your broken little flesh market,

你的尸骨将无人问津
they'll never even find what's left of you.

所以
So...

你对此有什么异议么
do you deny a part in all this?

瑟曦召我到君临
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

我可不敢抗命
I dared not refuse her.

她想要什么
And what did she want?

我既不能保持缄默 更不能说谎

不过我也有一些别的消息

正如您所说 我们的利益是一致的

我这里正好有一件礼物送给您

什么礼物

The same kind I gave Cersei.

一个年轻的帅小伙儿
A handsome young man.

许多伟大的角斗士
Many worthy fighters have died

倒在角斗大会的门边
trying to make it to the great games.

今天下午 你们这群无能废物里的大多数将走向死亡
When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon,

这或许已经是你们人生中最光彩的一刻了
it will represent a significant rise in your station.

不过要是你们谁能够得胜的话
But if you do happen to triumph here,

就能去达兹纳克大竞技场
you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself

在女王陛下前面战斗
in front of the queen.

所以 不管发生了什么 众神今天已经在对你们微笑了
So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today.

今天起 你们的生命开始真正有了意义
This is the day your lives actually start to mean something.

你 还有你 你
You and you. You.

你们两个
You two.

你 你 还有你
You, you, and you.

起来
Up.

Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.
Valar morghulis. Valar dohaeris.

各就各位
Prepare yourselves.

看完最终的角斗大会必然糟糕透顶
Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.

历朝历代 在最终的角斗大会即将来临之际
For generations in the days leading up to the great games,

在一些小的会场里四处巡视
it has been customary for our ruler

并将君王驾临的荣耀赐予那里的角斗者
to make the rounds of the lower pits

对于我们的统治者来说可谓惯例
to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.

动作麻利点
Move yourselves.

女王陛下
Your Grace.

未来的国王陛下
Your future Grace.

你们让我等荣幸之至
You honor us all.

都站好了
Stand there.

站直溜点儿 那可是他妈的女王
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

我等为您的荣誉而战 万死不辞
We fight and die for your glory,

女王万岁
O glorious queen.

我等为您的荣誉而战 万死不辞
We fight and die for your glory,

女王万岁
O glorious queen.

上啊
Fight!

我觉得我看够了
I think I've seen enough.

陛下 这是传统
Your Grace, it is a tradition

女王应当亲眼目睹胜利者的诞生
for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.

我为你们的传统已经牺牲得够多了
I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.

你这是要干什么
What are you doing?

还没轮到你上场呢 你这烂渣
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.

不要让我看到他
Get him out of my sight.

求您了 卡丽熙
Khaleesi, please.

我只占用您一点时间
I just need a moment of your time.

我为您带来了一件礼物
I brought you a gift.

没错
It's true.

他确实带来了礼物
He has.

你是谁
Who are you?

我就是那件礼物
I am the gift.

很荣幸能见到您 陛下
It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.

我名叫提利昂·兰尼斯特
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

玛格丽·提利尔
托曼的王后

这实在是太可怕了
This is horrible.

令人无法接受
Unacceptable.

他们有给你足够的吃的么
Are they feeding you enough at least?

我给你带来了这个 鹿肉
I brought you this. Venison.

我昨晚吃剩下的
It's quite good.

味道还不错哦
I had it myself for supper only last night.

从他们带走你哥哥之后我们便竭尽全力
We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother.

托曼甚至亲临圣堂
Tommen even went to the sept himself

与大麻雀对峙
to confront the High Sparrow.

但恐怕七神教会已然不问缘由了
But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.

我知道这是你干的
I know you did this.

我们已经为你尽了一切努力
We are making every effort on your behalf.

七神在上 我发誓
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

你的谎言来得太容易了
Lies come easily to you.

谁都知道
Everyone knows that.

但是纯洁
But innocence,

正派 仁爱
decency, concern,

恐怕你并不擅长这些
you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

或许这就是为什么你的儿子如此渴望
Perhaps that's why your son was so eager

为了我而疏远你
to cast you aside for me.

你好沮丧
You're upset.

你脑子也不太清醒了
You're not thinking clearly.

当你冷静下来 我会再来探望的
I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.

我可不想再见到你了
I don't want to see you again.

我诚挚地期望看到你改主意
I do hope you change your mind about that.

我听说在红堡地下的黑牢里
I've been told men often go mad

人们往往会被逼疯
in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

不过我认为审判一旦开始
Though I suppose your isolation will end

你的牢狱生涯就会结束
when your trial begins.

出去
Leave.

当然
Yes.

我也必须得走了
I'm afraid I must.

我的儿子现在比任何时候都更需要我
My son needs me now more than ever.

滚出去 你这个可憎的婊子
Get out, you hateful bitch!

祝你好梦 妹妹
Sleep well, sister.

谢谢你 博科
Thank you, Boake.

您见了她么？ 是的
You saw her? Yes.

然后？ 她住的地方还算宽敞
And? Her accommodations seem sufficient.

接下来她会怎么样
What happens to her now?

唔 她和她哥哥
Well, she and her brother are both being held

都有明确的嫌疑
under fair suspicion.

我们将审判他们
A trial will be held for each of them

并断定他们的某些行为
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

是否构成对七神信仰戒律的违背 进而获罪
that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith.

谁会主持审判呢
Who will stand judge?

七大主教 这在坦格里安王朝之前就是惯例了
Seven septons as it was in all trials before the Targaryens.

你会是其中之一么
Will you be one of them?

当然是
I will.

如果他俩中间有人
If one or both of them

在审判之前忏悔的话
were to confess before the trial...

那么他们就会得到圣母的慈爱
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

圣母的慈爱意味着什么
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

这得看情况
It depends upon the situation.

得看他们到底做了什么 以及忏悔的程度
The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.

谢谢您 大主教
Thank you, High Septon,

希望您能在七神注视之下
for bringing them whatever justice they deserve

对他们的行为作出公正的判决
in the eyes of the Seven.

您可知道这座小教堂
Did you know this chapel

是君临最古老的几座建筑之一么
is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?

我想我略有耳闻
I think I may have heard at one point.

圣贝勒在其之上建造了他的圣堂
Baelor built his sept around it.

但更早以前 人们就在这里祭拜七神了
But men worshipped here long before him.

这座圣坛是谁建造的
Who carved this altar?

您知道么？ 恐怕不知道
Do you know? I'm afraid I don't.

没人知道
No one does.

这座祭坛上没有写着任何名字
There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel.

的确 建造这个地方的人们
No, the people who built this place

并没打算向后人展示自己的虚荣
didn't inflict their vanity on those who came after them

他们没有像圣贝勒那样留下一座镀金的畸形怪物
the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

唔
Hmm.

他们的信仰很纯净
Their faith was clean.

揭掉了金银和虚饰
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

拆除了雕像和石柱
knock down the statues and the pillars,

而这留存下来的东西
and this is what remains.

简单 牢固
Something simple...

而且真实
and solid and true.

提利尔们的矫饰将被揭去
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

他们的谎言将被拆穿
Their lies knocked down.

他们的真心将昭然于天下
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

而我等将得此教训
And so it will be for all of us.

高低贵贱 皆是一样
High and low alike.

如果把你的矫饰也揭开
What will we find

我们会发现什么呢
when we strip away your finery?

不久之前 一个身心俱疲的年轻人
A young man came to us not long ago.

来找过我们
Broken in body and spirit.

他承受的太多 不堪重负
He had so much to strip away.

因而要把他们抛弃
So much weighing him down.

不过 最终他一点点的卸去了重担
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

抛弃了虚荣
Let go of vanity,

傲慢 和罪恶
pride, sin.

现在他的灵魂十分轻灵
Now his soul is so light,

他将化作鸟雀飞向七重天
he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird.

哼
Hmm.

对于你 他有不少话想说
And he has much to say about you.

蓝塞尔·兰尼斯特
瑟曦、詹姆的堂弟
