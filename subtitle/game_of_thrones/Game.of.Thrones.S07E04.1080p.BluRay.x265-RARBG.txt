原著  乔治・R・R・马丁

第七季第四集  The Spoils of War
战利品

让那辆马车停下！
Hold that wagon!

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者”

黑水河的波隆
爵士

你刚刚赢得了世界上最丰厚的战利品
You've just won the biggest prize in the world.

还忧郁个啥？
What could you possibly have to be upset about?

没事儿 你尽管告诉我
Come on, you can tell me.

荆棘女王在临死之前
Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls

最后还刺了你的蛋蛋吗？
before saying goodbye?

我还是去找总主教倾诉衷肠吧
I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.

已经没有什么总主教了
There is no more High Septon.

对 没有了 不是吗？
No, there isn't, is there?

但是我的那份奖赏可不能没有
There is still the question of my prize.

我刚给你的钱可够多了
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

我要的是城堡
It's not a castle.

那边那座怎么样？它刚好缺个主人呢
How about that one? It's available.

你不会想要高庭的
You don't want Highgarden.

我可不敢苟同 现在是战争时期
I beg to differ. We're at war.

你搬进城堡不到两天 丹妮莉丝・坦格利安就可能会把它夺回去
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.

另外 考虑下维护费
Besides, think of the upkeep.

你拥有的越多 要承担的也就越重
The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.

哦 这就是你他妈这么丧气的原因？
Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?

新抢来的金子成了你的无法承受之重？
All your new riches weighing you down?

出发！ 那些金子不是我的
Move out! They're not mine.

它们都归铁金库所有
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

看到了没？我们有债必还
See? We pay our debts.

好吧 就是没还我的
Right, just not to me.

黑水河的波隆爵士 出身于… 
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of...

管你出身于哪个不知名的臭屎堆
whatever nameless shit heap you're from

带着满满一挎包的金子
with a saddlebag full of gold,

还在抱怨自己没得到足够的回报
complaining about not getting paid.

等我们赢了这场战争
When we win this war,

再也没有人能从你手中抢走东西
all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms

七大王国的所有城堡
will be yours to choose from,

任你挑选
with no one left to take them away from you.

是啊 我非常确信瑟曦女王的统治
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign

将会宁静而祥和
will be quiet and peaceable.

比这更离谱的事情也不是没发生过
Ah, stranger things have happened.

比如说？
Like what?

大人 所有的粮仓已被清空 粮食都装在马车上了
The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.

那现在地里的庄稼呢？我们已让好几队人马去收割
The current harvest? We have teams of men collecting it

蓝道・塔利
角陵伯爵

狄肯・塔利
蓝道・塔利的次子

河湾地的所有农田
from all the farms in the Reach.

波隆爵士 你愿意协同塔利家族
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys

帮助他们加快进程吗？
and help them accelerate this process?

我不太擅长收割小麦
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

没错 但督促那些顽抗的农夫交出他们的收成
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest

我确信你对此肯定很有一套
I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.

大人 先告退了
My lord.

告退
My lord.

不得不承认 铁金库从未
I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank

有过在如此短期内就迅速还清的巨额债款
has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.

我过去总是认为您的父亲是一位雷厉风行的人
I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man,

泰楚・奈斯托斯
布拉佛斯铁金库的代表

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
铁王座上的女王

但如今您彻底重新定义了这个词语
but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.

大人 您太客气了
You're too kind, my lord.

陛下 我既不客气也不是什么大人
I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.

我只是我所代表的机构的一枚棋子
I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.

铁金库的运转是个算术问题 感性无济于事
Its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.

而目前的运算结果让我们非常满意
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

呃 黄金…  在路上了
Uh, the gold... Is on its way.

由我弟弟亲自护送
My brother is supervising its transportation himself.

看来铁金库有人要失望了
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.

他们可是觊觎您的利息很久了
They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.

我们得想办法让他们打起精神才好
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

是啊 对于眼下您要下的赌注 说不定我们能帮上忙呢
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.

此刻我要下的唯一赌注就是重新统治维斯特洛大陆
My only venture at this moment is reestablishing control over this continent

统治维斯特洛的每个人
and every person on it.

我觉得这笔投资能带来巨大的回报
I see a great deal of potential in that venture.

我想您或许需要一些来自他人的资助
I imagine it would require outside investment.

的确需要
It will, indeed.

我需要壮大陆军 海军
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

我的女王之手 科本 已向厄斯索斯的黄金团发出邀请
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.

我很了解他们
I know them well.

他们曾帮我们从那些欠债不还的人那里追回过不少钱
They have helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.

那可真是个好消息
That's good to hear.

我也希望他们能为我追回本属于我的东西
I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.

您大可放心 女王陛下
Rest assured, Your Grace,

铁金库会成为您值得信赖的盟友
you can count on the Iron Bank's support.

唔 只要金子一到
Hmm. As soon as the gold arrives.

这个给你
This is for you.

布兰・史塔克
绿先知

培提尔・贝里席
“小指头”

上一个使用它的人曾想用它割断你的喉咙
The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat,

但你母亲阻止了他
but your mother fought him off.

而另一把匕首
The other dagger,

夺走她性命的那把
the one that took her life,

我愿意替她挡掉那把匕首
I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart

如果我在场的话
if I could have.

她最需要我时 我竟不在她身旁
I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.

但现在我就在这儿
But I am here for her now

替她完成她最想做的事情
to do what she would have done,

保护她的孩子
to protect her children.

布兰登 如果有什么需要我做的
Anything I can do for you, Brandon,

尽管开口
you need only ask.

你知道这把匕首是谁的么？
Do you know who this belonged to?

不知道
No.

正是这把不知其主的匕首挑起了五王之战
That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.

某种程度而言 正是这把匕首让你变成了今天的样子
In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.

背井离乡
Forced from your home,

流亡到长城外的蛮荒之地
driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.

我想你一定目睹了常人无法想象的事物
I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.

历经磨难 千辛万苦重回家乡
To go through all of that and make your way home again

却发现这个世界只剩如此这般的混乱
only to find such chaos in the world,

我真的无法想象
I can only imagine

混乱是把梯子
Chaos is a ladder.

梅拉・黎德

我很抱歉打扰您 史塔克大人
I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.

我不是史塔克大人
I'm not Lord Stark.

那是什么？
What's that?

沃肯学士帮我做的
Maester Wolkan built it for me

我行动起来能更方便一些
so I can move around more easily.

这办法真不错
It's a very good idea.

你要走了
You're leaving.

我不想离开你的
I don't want to leave you,

但是当… 当异鬼来的时候
but whenwhen they come,

我要和我的家人在一起
I need to be with my family.

再说你已经安全了
And you're safe.

呃 至少和其他人一样安全
Well, as safe as anyone can be now.

你不再需要我了
You don't need me anymore.

对 我不再需要你了
No, I don't.

你想说的就这些？
That's all you've got to say?

谢谢
Thank you.

谢谢？
Thank you?

谢谢你帮我
For helping me.

我弟弟为你而死
My brother died for you.

阿多和夏天为你而死
Hodor and Summer died for you.

我也差点为你而死
I almost died for you.

布兰…  我并不是布兰
Bran... I'm not, really.

不再是了
Not anymore.

我记得身为布兰登・史塔克的那些时光
I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark,

但如今我记得太多其他事情了
but I remember so much else now.

你在那个山洞里就死了
You died in that cave.

艾莉亚・史塔克

我上了那个厨娘 红头发那个 从后面
I did the kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind.

你唯一能在厨房干的就是那些内脏
The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.

站住！ 往哪儿走呢？
'Ey up. Where you going?

让我进去 我住这儿
In there. I live here.

滚蛋
Fuck off.

我是艾莉亚・史塔克 这是我家
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

艾莉亚・史塔克已经死了
Arya Stark's dead.

通报鲁温学士或者罗德利克爵士
Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrick.

他们会告诉你我是谁 这里没有罗德利克爵士
They'll tell you who I am. There's no Rodrick here.

只有沃肯学士
Maester's named Wolkan.

那就去问问北境之王琼恩・雪诺
Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North.

他是我哥哥 他离这儿可有一千里地呢
He's my brother. He's a thousand miles away.

你给我听着 天儿很冷 我们也很忙
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

所以 识相点 最好马上滚 嗯
so, you know, best fuck off. Mm.

琼恩要是走了 那现在谁在掌管临冬城？
If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?

临冬城公爵夫人 史塔克小姐
The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.

哪个史塔克小姐？ 你说呢
Which Lady Stark? You tell us.

你不是正在这儿冒充她妹妹嘛
You're the one impersonating her sister.

告诉珊莎 她妹妹回家了
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

珊莎小姐很忙 没空跟你浪费功夫 我们也一样
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.

所以 最后警告你一次 滚蛋
So, for the last time, fuck off.

无论如何 我都要进入这座城堡
I'm getting into this castle one way or another.

如果我并非我所宣称的身份 我便不会久留
If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.

但如果我所言非虚 而珊莎发现你们将我拒之门外… 
But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away...

好吧 你坐在这儿
Right, you sit there.

就这儿
Right there.

别乱走动
Don't move.

好了 你去通报史塔克小姐 我来看住她
Right, go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

我才不要通报史塔克小姐 要去你去
I ain't telling Lady Stark. You can tell her.

凭什么我去？
Why me?

你去通报 我才不
You're gonna tell her. I'm not.

如果你不去 我就一拳揍在你那张逼脸上
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face

要多狠有多狠
as hard as I can.

我们让她等着
We told her to wait.

我们就站在她旁边 然后… 
We were standing right next to her, and...

珊莎・史塔克

然后 然后我们一转身她就不见了 小姐
Andand when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady.

她 她不算什么 就是个临冬城镇上的女孩
Sheshe was nothing. Some winter town girl.

她一进来就要找 呃 罗德利克爵士
She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrik...

罗德利克 对 还有 鲁温 对 … 还有鲁温学士
Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah. ...and Maester Luwin.

别在这种小事上劳心费神 小姐
And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady.

我们会 我们会找到她的 你们不用找了
We'llwe'll find her. You don't have to.

我知道她在哪儿
I know where she is.

我是不是该叫你史塔克夫人了？
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

是的
Yes.

你不用从守卫身边逃走的
You shouldn't have run from the guards.

我没有逃
I didn't run.

守卫不太行
You need better guards.

挺适合你的…  史塔克夫人
It suits you... Lady Stark.

琼恩把你留在这管事？
Jon left you in charge?

是的
He did.

我真希望他能早点回来
I hope he comes back soon.

我还记得他见到我时有多么欣喜若狂
I remember how happy he was to see me.

如果见到你 他可能心脏都不会跳了
When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.

看起来根本不像他
It doesn't look like him.

应该由熟悉他长相的人来雕刻的
Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.

熟悉他长相的人都死了
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

我们没有啊
We're not.

传闻说是你杀了乔佛里
They say you killed Joffrey.

真是你吗？
Did you?

是我就好了
I wish I had.

嗯 我也希望是我
Hmm. Me, too.

听说有人捷足先登时 我很生气
I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.

不管我的名单有多长 他永远都排在首位
However long my list got, he was always first.

名单？
Your list?

我要杀的人的名单
Of people I'm going to kill.

你是怎么回到临冬城的？
How did you get back to Winterfell?

说来话长
It's a long story.

我想你也一样
I imagine yours is, too.

确实
Yes.

不是个让人开心的故事
Not a very pleasant one.

我的也是
Mine neither.

但我们的故事还未结束
But our stories aren't over yet.

没错 还未结束
No, they're not.

艾莉亚… 
Arya...

布兰也回家了
Bran's home, too.

你回家了
You came home.

我看到你在十字路口客栈
I saw you at the crossroads.

你看到我了？
You saw me?

现在的我能看到很多事物
I see quite a lot now.

布兰拥有…  视野
Bran has... visions.

我以为你要去君临城
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

我当时确实要去
So did I.

你要回去干嘛？
Why would you go back there?

瑟曦在她的名单上
Cersei's on her list of names.

还有谁在你的名单上？
Who else is on your list?

他们大多数都已经死了
Most of them are dead already.

你从哪弄来的？
Where did you get this?

小指头给我的
Littlefinger gave it to me.

小指头？他在这儿？
Littlefinger? He's here?

他已宣誓效忠史塔克家族
He has declared for House Stark.

他为什么要给你一把匕首？
Why would he give you a dagger?

他以为我想要 为什么？
He thought I'd want it. Why?

因为它本是用来刺杀我的
Because it was meant to kill me.

刺客…  你坠楼后那个？
The cutthroat... after your fall?

为什么一个刺客能有瓦雷利亚钢匕首？
Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?

应该是某位权贵想让我死
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

小指头不是个大方的人
He's not a generous man.

他不会轻易付出
He wouldn't give you anything

除非他觉得从中有利可图
unless he thought he was getting something back.

这不重要 为什么不重要？
It doesn't matter. What do you mean it doesn't matter?

我并不想要
I don't want it.

你确定吗？
Are you sure?

这可是瓦雷利亚钢
It's Valyrian steel.

在瘸子手上是浪费
It's wasted on a cripple.

塔斯的布蕾妮
“美人”

凯特琳・史塔克会为您骄傲的
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

波德瑞克・派恩
布蕾妮的侍从

您恪守了您的誓言
You kept your vow.

我几乎什么都没做
I did next to nothing.

小姐 您对您自己太过苛刻了
You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

我不是… 
I'm not a...

谢谢你 波德瑞克
Thank you, Podrick.

陛下 无垢者那边依然没有消息
Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.

快了
Soon.

他会回到你身边的
He will come back to you.

但愿吧
He'd better.

发生什么了？
What happened?

很多事情
Many things.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生”  在龙石岛的女王

很多事情？
Many things?

弥桑黛
女王的翻译

陛下
Your Grace.

没关系的

琼恩・雪诺
北境之王

在我们成批开采之前
I wanted you to see it

我想让您先看点东西
before we start hacking it to bits.

就是这些了 我们所需要的就是如此
Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.

陛下 我还有些别的东西想向您展示
There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.

这些是森林之子刻下的
The children of the forest made these.

什么时候？
When?

很久很久以前
A very long time ago.

他们就在这里
They were right here,

站在我们所站的地方
standing where we're standing.

在坦格利安 史塔克 还有兰尼斯特这些家族存在之前
Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.

也许 甚至在人类存在之前
Maybe even before there were men.

不会
No.

森林之子和先民曾一同在此
They were here together, the children and the First Men.

做什么？彼此打来打去？
Doing what? Fighting each other?

他们一同对抗他们共同的敌人
They fought together against their common enemy.

摒弃彼此之间的差异与猜忌
Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.

并肩作战
Together.

要想活命 我们也得这么做
We need to do the same if we're going to survive.

因为敌人是真实存在的
Because the enemy is real.

一直都是
It's always been real.

你说如果没有我的龙和军队
And you say you can't defeat them

就不能击败他们？
without my armies and my dragons?

是的 我觉得我做不到
No, I don't think I can.

我会为你而战
I will fight for you.

我会为北境而战
I will fight for the North.

只要你俯首称臣
When you bend the knee.

我的人民… 
My people...

恐怕不会接受一个南方的统治者
won't accept a southern ruler.

尤其是在他们遭受了那些事以后
Not after everything they've suffered.

如果他们的国王接受 他们也会的
They will if their king does.

他们选择你去领导他们
They chose you to lead them.

他们选择你去保护他们
They chose you to protect them.

他们的生命难道不比你的傲气更重要吗？
Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

怎么了？
What is it?

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

提利昂・兰尼斯特
女王之手

我们攻下了凯岩城
We took Casterly Rock.

听起来不错啊
That's very good to hear.

不是吗？
Isn't it?

您还是和自己人私下讨论吧
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.

也许…  你们留下
PerhapsYou will stay.

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

我失去了所有的盟友
All my allies are gone.

他们被一网打尽而我却一直闲坐在这岛上
They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.

您仍然拥有最大的军队 他们没饭可吃
You still have the largest armies. Who won't be able to eat

因为瑟曦夺走了河湾地所有的粮食
because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

把灰虫子和无垢者召回来
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

我们仍然有足够的船把多斯拉克人载到大陆
We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.

我们要专注于封锁君临
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

我们的计划仍然可行
We have a plan. It's still the right plan.

可行的计划！
The right plan!

你的策略让我们失去了多恩 铁群岛以及河湾地
Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

如果我低估了我们的敌人 我们的敌人？
If I have underestimated our enemiesOur enemies?

你是说你的家人
Your family, you mean.

也许你根本就不想伤害他们
Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.

我受够了这些高明的计划
Enough with the clever plans.

我有三条巨龙
I have three large dragons.

我打算骑着它们飞到红堡
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

我们商量过这个… 
We've discussed this.

我的敌人就在红堡里
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

如果我不甘冒生命危险打败他们 我算个什么女王？
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?

明智的女王
A smart one.

你觉得我该怎么做？
What do you think I should do?

我没想过…  我处于战争当中
I would never presume toI'm at war.

我快输了
I'm losing.

你觉得我到底该怎么做？
What do you think I should do?

我从没想过龙还会再出现
I never thought that dragons would exist again.

没有人想过
No one did.

那些追随您的人
The people who follow you

知道您做了件不可能做到的事
know that you made something impossible happen.

或许这会让他们相信
Maybe that helps them believe

您还能创造其他奇迹
that you can make other impossible things happen.

您会打破人们所熟知的那个肮脏的旧世界
Build a world that's different

建立前所未有的新世界
from the shit one they've always known.

但是如果你用龙熔化城堡 烧毁城市
But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities,

你就没什么特别的
you're not different.

只是个新的暴君
You're just more of the same.

别猛扑
Don't lunge.

别让敌人带着你跑
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

起来
Up.

也别
And don't

根本就别和她这样的人打
Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

好剑
Nice sword.

匕首更好
Very nice dagger.

他们要是还没给仓库交够粮食
If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores,

恐怕就只能带来多少吃多少了
then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.

咱们不能… 
We can't...

我很久没练习了
It's been a while since I trained.

我去给您找总教头 小姐
I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.

他可没有打赢过猎狗
He didn't beat the Hound.

你赢过
You did.

我想跟你练练
I want to train with you.

你起过誓要效忠于我母亲的两个女儿
You swore to serve both my mother's daughters,

是吧？
didn't you?

闪开 波德瑞克
Move aside, Podrick.

你不能用那个 小姐 太小了
You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.

我不会弄伤你的 别担心
I won't cut you. Don't worry.

我也尽量不弄伤你
I'll try not to.

这些都是谁教你的
Who taught you how to do that?

没谁
No one.

你觉得她怎么样？ 谁？
What do you think of her? Who?

我知道你很清楚我问的是谁
I believe you know of whom I speak.

我觉得她有颗仁心
I think she has a good heart.

仁心？
A good heart?

我是发现你盯着人家的“仁心”看来着
I've noticed you staring at her good heart.

没那个闲工夫
There's no time for that.

我见过夜王 戴佛斯 我曾和他对视
I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes.

我们在北境有多少人能和他作战？
How many men do we have in the North to fight him?

一万？或许再少点？
10,000? Less?

差远了 什么？
Fewer. What?

说到“仁心” 纳斯的弥桑黛在这儿
Speaking of good heartsMissandei of Naath.

戴佛斯爵士 雪诺大人
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

不该叫雪诺国王吗？
King Snow, isn't it?

不行 听起来怪怪的
No, that doesn't sound right.

琼恩国王？ 这不重要
King Jon? It doesn't matter.

不好意思 我能问个问题吗？
Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

当然
Of course.

为什么您父亲的名字是奈德・史塔克 您却叫琼恩・雪诺？
Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?

我是私生子
I'm a bastard.

我母亲并未与我父亲成婚
My mother and father weren't married.

纳斯的习俗不是这样吗？
Is the custom different in Naath?

我们纳斯没有婚姻制度
We don't have marriage in Naath,

所以根本不存在私生子的概念
so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

听起来挺… 自由的
That sounds... liberating.

你为什么离开家乡？
Why did you leave your homeland?

我是被奴隶贩子拐走的
I was stolen away by slavers.

抱歉
I'm sorry.

恕我冒昧 你是如何从一个奴隶女孩
If I may, how did a slave girl

变成丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的顾问的？
come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?

她从奴隶主手中将我买下 给我自由
She bought me from my master and set me free.

真是了不起
That was good of her.

当然 现在你就效忠于她了 对吧
Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?

我效忠我的女王是因为我想这么做
I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.

因为我信赖她
Because I believe in her.

要是你明天想驾船回纳斯老家呢？
And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?

那么她会给我一艘船 然后祝我好运
Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

你相信她会这么做？
You believe that?

不只是相信 而是知道
I know it.

从厄斯索斯随她而来的所有人
All of us who came with her from Essos,

我们都相信她
we believe in her.

她之所以是我们的女王
She's not our queen because she's the daughter

不是因为她是某个我们根本不认识的国王的女儿
of some king we never knew.

而是因为我们自己选择了她
She's the queen we chose.

要是我换个边站 你能原谅我吗？
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

那是葛雷乔伊家的船吗？
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

停！
Halt!

席恩・葛雷乔伊

琼恩
Jon.

我没想到你在这儿
I didn't know you were here.

珊… 珊莎
SSansa...

她还好吗?
is she all right?

要不是念在你还算帮过她
What you did for her...

我现在已经杀了你了
is the only reason I'm not killing you.

听说你叔叔突袭了你们的舰队
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.

我们都以为你死了
We thought you were dead.

我是该死了的
I should be.

你姐姐呢？
Your sister?

在攸伦手里
Euron has her.

我是来求女王帮我救她回来的
I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.

女王已经走了
The queen is gone.

她去哪儿了？
Where did she go?

饮马！
Get the horses watered!

金子已经全部安全运进君临城门
All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.

很好
Good.

我们得让最后几车辎重
We need to get the last of these wagons

赶在日落前渡过黑水河
over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.

如果运输前线遭遇伏击
The head of the line is ambushed,

那么后方肯定来不及救援
the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.

也对 运输线拖的有点长了
Well, we are stretched a bit thin.

那么请您准许
With your permission,

用鞭子抽打那些掉队的 会更有效率
flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.

可以 但动手之前必须先有口头警告
Let's give them fair warning first.

毕竟这些人都在高庭拼过命
These men fought well at Highgarden.

来来来 把这东西抱住了
Now, get it on this thing.

抬起来！
Lift!

詹姆爵士 瑞肯
Ser Jaime. Rickon.

是狄肯
Dickon.

我听说了你在高庭的英勇表现
I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.

第一次上战场？
Your first battle?

感觉如何？
And?

无上荣光
It was glorious.

说点实话吧 你父亲又没在这儿
Come on, your father's not here.

从小到大 我们都一直效忠于提利尔家族
All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.

他们当中的不少人我都认识 也一起打过猎
I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.

他们确实死的可惜
They didn't deserve to die.

要怪只能怪奥莲娜夫人背叛了她的女王
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her queen

投向了坦格利安家那女孩
and support the Targaryen girl.

所以我们才来讨伐他们
So here we are.

可我从来没想到战场上会是这种气味
I didn't expect it to smell like that.

人在快死的时候会屎尿横流
Men shit themselves when they die.

你们公子哥上的学校不教这个吗？
Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

好吧 我五岁的时候就知道了
Well, I learned it when I was five.

怎么了？
What?

快回君临吧 我决不会抛下自己的军队
Get back to King's Landing. I'm not abandoning my army.

你是指挥官 不是小兵蛋子
You're the commander, not a damn infantryman.

这些混账就要包围我们了
Those fuckers are about to swamp us.

我们能守得住
We can hold them off.

科本的弩炮在那边
Qyburn's scorpion is over there.

那就赶紧用上
Go get it, then.

我只有一只手怎么用
I can't shoot with one hand.

驾！
Come on!

谁来帮帮我！
Need help!

躲哪去了？
Where are you?

你的族人打仗不行啊



掩护！
Take cover!

来吧 贱人
Come on, you fucker.

Flee, you idiot.

来吧 宝贝儿 驾！

傻子 真他妈是个傻子
You idiot. You fucking idiot.

我来到这里不是为了杀戮
I'm not here to murder.

你们要么屈膝效忠于我
Bend the knee and join me.

要么… 死路一条
Or refuse... and die.

你必须想办法让她听进去
You need to find a way to make her listen.

顺我者昌
Whatever stands in our way...

逆我者亡
we will defeat.

布兰看到过夜王跟他的大军
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching

正往东海望去
towards Eastwatch.

恶战将至
Bad things are coming.
