火也需要呼吸

你小时候就有人替你生火吗？

得有几千个年头了

我想是吧
I think.

这有什么用？
What does it do?

我不确定它是否有用
I'm not sure that it does anything.

可它很美 不是吗？
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

还要多久才能到？ 用不了多久
How much longer? Not so far.

几天就到了
A few more days.

长城真像传说中那么高大吗？
Is the Wall as big as they say?

更高大
Bigger.

有时甚至看不到它的顶端
So big you can't even see the top sometimes.

因为藏到云里边去了
It's hidden in clouds.

你在逗我吧
You're playing with me.

我可没有 有700尺高呢
I'm not. It's 700 feet high,

全部由冰筑成

天气暖和的时候 你可以看到它“流泪”
On a warm day you can see it weeping.

黑城堡是个好地方

都生着炉火

你会唱歌吗？ 不会
Do you sing? No.

不 不 不 我唱得不好
No, no, no. Not very well.

给我唱首歌吧
Sing me a song.

噢 那好吧
Oh, all right.

我想想
Let's see.

噢…  咳咳
Oh... ahem.

兔子皮可不是这么剥的
That's not how you skin a rabbit.

梅拉・黎德

我知道怎么剥兔子皮
I know how to skin a rabbit.

瞧着可不像
Not by the looks of it.

布兰・史塔克

如果你在长城以北长大
You grow up north of the Wall,

就会知道该怎么处理猎物
you learn the proper way to handle game.

来这之前我没处理过什么猎物
I didn't see any game before I got here.

如果我有弓 我能猎到一打兔子
If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.

好吧 这弓可是我自己做的
Well, I made this bow myself.

我猜你在长城以北没学会这门手艺
Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.

你倒是学会了怎么用拳头
You learn how to use your fists, though.

哦 你打算用拳头把兔子活活打死吗？
Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?

我想的可不是兔子 是别人
I had someone else in mind.

好吧 “别人”现在正在这儿坐着
Well, someone else is sitting right here.

你们两位都很会剥兔子皮
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

其中一位稍微剥得好点儿
Some of us are just a little better.

是啊 当“别人”辛苦打猎 弄来早餐时
Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else

“其中一位”应该说声“谢谢”
hunts down their breakfast for them.

也许在长城以北没人教过你？
Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?

你嘴巴太大 丫头 而且牙齿太多了
You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.

停下！ 阿多
Stop it! Hodor.

你们从刚见面就一直吵个不休 拜托歇会儿吧
You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.

黎德小姐的尾巴快翘到天上去了
Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass,

她居然还能在地上站稳简直是个奇迹
it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.

你每天都对她恶言相向
You've been nasty to her every day.

她当然会以恶言针锋相对
Of course she's nasty back.

我？ 这么说来是我的错了？
Me? It's my fault?

我第一次见她 她就把匕首搁我脖子上
First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.

我第一次见你 你也把匕首搁我脖子上
First time I met you, you held a knife at me.

我们不能内讧
We can't fight each other.

不然永远都别想到长城
We'll never make it to the Wall.

我需要你们休战
I want you both to make peace.

你剥兔子皮的方法的确比我更快
Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.

我早就说了 不是么？ 欧莎！
I said so, didn't I? Osha!

你是个出色的小猎手
You're a good little hunter.

谢谢
Thank you.

看？
See?

没那么难 是吧？谢谢
Not so hard, is it? Thank you.

别逼我
Don't push me.

他怎么了？
What's wrong with him?

绿之视野需要付出代价
The visions take their toll.

他又看到了么？
He's having one now?

我看到琼恩・雪诺了
I saw Jon Snow.

你看到他了？
You saw him?

在黑城堡？
At Castle Black?

他在长城的另一边 相反的那边… 
He was on the wrong side of the Wall...

被敌人团团包围

从前 长城附近一里内是找不到树的

Aren't you? Aye.

向上难于登天 往下万劫不复
It's a long way up and a long way down.

可我已经等了一辈子
But I've waited my whole life

想站在长城上看看这个世界
to see the world from up there.

过来 坐下 我给你拿了一双
Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.

对你来说大了点 但是很好用
They're too big for you, but they're good.

你为它们杀人了？
You kill someone for them?

没
Nah.

我没杀他
I didn't kill him,

但我敢打赌他的卵蛋还肿着
but I bet his balls are still bruised.

他不像你这么对我好
He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.

也做不了你用舌头玩的花样
He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.

我们能不在这儿提这事吗？
Can we not talk about that here?

“我们能不在这儿提这事吗？”

你真以为我和你从小看到大的那些
Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls

穿丝绸裙装的女孩一样蠢吗？
in silk dresses you knew growing up?

你忠诚 你勇敢
You're loyal and you're brave.

从你走进曼斯・雷德的帐篷那天到现在
You didn't stop being a crow

你不该有这种法力

我没有法力

我请求真主的帮助

而真主回应了我

我一直是一个糟糕的僧侣

承认这点很糟糕
It's a terrible thing to say,

当我来到维斯特洛时 我已经不信奉我们的真主了

我觉得他跟其余神祗一样
I decided that He, that all the gods,

是我们为了让孩子听话而编的故事
were stories we told the children to make them behave.

吟诵那些古老的辞句
and said the old words.

倒不是因为我相信它们 但… 
Not because I believed in them, but...

他是我的朋友
he was my friend

可他死了
and he was dead.

那是我唯一会说的祷辞
And they were the only words I knew.

因为你是个女孩
That's 'cause you're a girl.

那跟这有啥关系？
What does that have to do with anything?

抱歉 小子
Forgive me, lad.

你们在干什么？放开他
What are you doing? Let go of him.

让他们住手  过来
Tell them to stop. Come on.

他想成为你们中的一员
He wants to be one of you.

他想加入兄弟会 阻止他们！
He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!

我们侍奉光之王
We serve the Lord of Light

而光之王需要这个男孩
and the Lord of Light needs this boy.

是光之王告诉你的还是她告诉你的？
Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?

你们不是为了你们的神
You're not doing this for your god.

你们是为了金子
You're doing it for gold.

我们既为神也为金子
We're doing it for both, girl.

没有武器 马匹和食物
We can't defend the people without weapons

我们没法保护人民
and horses and food.

没有金子 我们就没法获得武器 马匹和食物
And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.

你说过这是个兄弟会
You told me this was a Brotherhood.

你说过我可以成为你们中的一员
You told me I could be one of you.

你能派上的用处比留在这里要大得多
You are more than they can ever be.

They're just foot soldiers in the great war.

棕色
brown eyes,

蓝色 绿色
blue eyes, green eyes.

你将永远阖上那些眼睛
Eyes you'll shut forever.

我们会再见面的
We will meet again.

你在盯着我的屁股 琼恩・雪诺？
You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?

你没事吧？
You all right?

只想看看你抗不抗打 小子

So let's play a game.

你身体的哪个部分是你最不需要的？
Which body part do you need the least?

求求你  “求求你”不是身体的一部分

现在
Now...

作为对这种背叛的赔偿
As restitution for this betrayal,

他要求赫伦堡和其领地
he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.

我不认为这 我们在为北境战斗
I don't think that'sWe are fighting for the North.

赫伦堡可不在北境
Harrenhal is not in the North.

战争结束的时候就是了
It is his once the war is over

它在战略上也不再有用了
and we have no further strategic need for it.

当然还有别的要求
And there's something else.

我们会尽所能供其所需
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

我们要的是人
Not what, whom.

什么？
What?

不
No.

我们父亲要求艾德慕大人迎娶
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed

他的一位女儿…  萝丝琳
one of his daughtersRoslin.

她多大了？
How old is she?

19.

我能先见她吗？
Could I see her first?

您想要数她有几颗牙不成？
You want to count her teeth?

我们明早出发前往孪河城
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

在我们离开之前要得到一个答复
We need an answer before we leave

而婚礼将在半个月内举行
and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter

不然盟约就此解除
or this alliance is at an end.

你父亲真的明白我们还在打仗吗？
Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?

父亲老了
Father is old.

见证女儿嫁给一个好丈夫
It will put his heart at peace

能让他安心
if he could see her wed to a good husband.

并且最近的经历让他对于
And his recent experience has made him wary

拖得太久的婚约没有信心
of long engagements.

可以理解
He has every right to be.

请允许我们商议一下
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

为什么我要让那个老黄鼠狼为我挑新娘？
Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?

至少我该和你有同样的选择权
At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.

我是他的封君
I'm his liege lord.

他是个骄傲的老头 然而我们伤害了他
He's a proud man and we've wounded him.

不是我干的
I didn't wound him.

我说不行
My answer is no.

听我说
Listen to me

听好了 你… 
and listen very carefully. You

神谕和律法说得都很清楚
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

没人能够强迫谁去结婚
No man can compel another man to marry.

我的拳头倒是可以强迫你的牙齿离开嘴巴
The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.

好了好了 你听见他说了
It's all right. You heard him.

如果你拒绝 我们和佛雷家的盟约就完蛋了
If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.

从我12岁开始他就想要把他的女儿塞给我了
He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12.

他到现在还没死心
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

如果我说不 他还会回来的
When I say no, he will come back

那时他就会让我挑一个女儿
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

你这是要赌上我们的自由
You're willing to risk our freedom

和性命去换一个漂亮点的老婆？
and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

我有仗要去打
I have a war to fight.

没有他们我们赢不了
We can't win it without them.

没时间讨价还价了
I have no time to haggle.

你说过你想弥补石磨坊的过失
You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.

你想起那次壮举了？
You recall that heroic engagement?

我说要补偿的时候没想到结婚这种事
I had something less permanent in mind.

我每战必胜
I've won every battle,

却赢不了这场战争
but I'm losing this war.

如果我们现在不这么做的话
If we don't do this and do it now,

就彻底输了
we're lost.

我会娶她的
I'll marry her.

你在为我赎罪 舅舅
You're paying for my sins, Uncle.

这对你既不公平也不正确
It's not fair or right.

我会记住的
I'll remember it.

我发现我的人终于给你找了点
I see my men have finally found you

适合你穿的
something appropriate to wear.

是的 感谢他们
Yes. Most kind of them.

你是史塔克的封臣 波顿大人
You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

我奉史塔克夫人之命
I am acting on Lady Stark's orders

把詹姆・兰尼斯特押送回君临
to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
“弑君者” 御林铁卫队长

罗柏国王离开赫伦堡的时候 他的母亲是他的囚犯
When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡伯爵

如果她不是他母亲的话
If she wasn't his mother,

他会以叛国罪绞死她
he'd have hanged her for treason.

布蕾妮・塔斯
“美人” 凯特琳的护卫

我必须把你们交还给罗柏・史塔克
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

你是该这么做
You should.

不过 你还是坐在这里
But instead, you're sitting here

看着我吃不了饭的样子
watching me fail at dinner.

这是为什么？
Why might that be?

战争是花钱的
Wars cost money.

很多人会为你出个好价钱
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

我们都知道谁会出最高价
We both know who would pay the most.

或者让你付出最多的代价
Or make you pay the most

如果让他发现你抓住我
if he found out you had captured me

并且送我回北境去服刑
and sent me back up north for a summary execution.

你是对的
You're right.

也许最保险的做法是杀了你们俩然后烧了尸体
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

也许是个不错的方法
It would be,

如果你真的以为我父亲不会知道真相
if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.

罗柏国王让你的父亲忙着呢
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.

他没空管别的
He doesn't have time for anything else.

他会为你腾出时间来的
He'll make time for you.

一旦你能够上路了
As soon as you're well enough to travel,

我会让你去君临的
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

这算是为我的部下所为的补偿
as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.

你得发誓告诉你父亲真相
And you will swear to tell your father the truth,

并不是我搞残你的
that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

喝一杯？ 我就算了
Shall we drink on it? I don't partake.

你明白对于普通人来说这有多可疑？
You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

好吧
Very well.

小姐
My lady,

祝我们的旅途不再节外生枝
may our journey continue without further incident.

哦 她不会和你一起走的
Oh, she won't be going with you.

我负责带詹姆爵士到… 
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to

你受指控参与叛国
You are charged with abetting treason.

恐怕我得坚持
I'm afraid I must insist.

你没权力坚持任何事情
You're in no place to insist on anything.

我期望你从不自量力上
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson

学到点什么
about overplaying your position.

没戏 为什么？
Impossible. Why?

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

我孙子是高庭的骄傲
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

奥莲娜夫人
玛格丽・提利尔的祖母

七大王国最炙手可热的未婚男子
The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.

您的女儿…  很富有
Your daughterIs rich,

并且是七大王国最美丽的女人
the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms...

还是国王的母亲
and the mother of the king.

太老了
Old.

太老了？
Old?

太老了
Old.

我算得上是这方面的专家了
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

衰老很快就会体现在她的身上
Her change will be upon her before long.

我懒得跟你解释还会发生什么变化
I'll spare you the details of what will happen then.

你们男人可能对嗜血杀戮挺有兴趣
You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter,

但这方面就是另一回事了
but this is another matter entirely.

岁月也在惩罚我们 我向你保证
The years punish us as well, I promise you that.

我的胃口倒还挺不错的
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

唯一会让我倒胃口的
The only thing that might turn it

是你孙子那些臭名昭著的行为
are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities.

你否认吗？ 哦 完全没有
Do you deny them? Oh, not at all.

彻头彻尾的玩火
A sword swallower through and through.

有这样丑闻的男孩
And a boy with his affliction

有机会娶到七国最美的女人
should be grateful for the opportunity

还能抹去身上的污点
to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms

应该心怀感激
and remove the stain from his name.

您有没有和表兄弟一同长大 泰温大人?
Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

您父亲封臣的儿子
Sons of your father's bannermen,

侍从 或者马房小弟?
squires, stable boys?

当然
Of course.

你就从没… 
And you never...

没有
No.

一次都没有？
Not once?

怎样都没有？
Not in any way?

从来没有
Never.

我真心称赞你的自制
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

不过两个男孩在床上
But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go

“打打闹闹”再正常不过了
at each other beneath the sheets.

也许“高”庭对于不正常的行为
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance

也有比较高的容忍度
for unnatural behavior.

我可不会这么说
I wouldn't say that.

当然 我们不会为这点基情
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots

就自寻烦恼 不过
over a discreet bit of buggery, but...

弟弟和姐姐
brothers and sisters

在我的家乡 可算是
where I come from, that stain

难以抹消的污点
would be very difficult to wash out.

我不想再讨论
I will not breathe further life

更多这种恶意的谎言
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

无论是不是谎言
Lie or not,

你必须承认很多人都觉得它挺可信的
you must admit many people find it quite convincing.

可信到他们能披甲上阵
Convincing enough to put swords in their hands

去杀些兰尼斯特
and send them off to kill Lannisters

和提利尔 都是因为我们的新联盟
and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.

我不管人们相信什么
I don't care what people believe.

你也不用管
And neither do you.

我代表自己 否认这点
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

现在 如果关于我孩子的谣言是真的
Now, if the rumors about my children were true,

那么乔佛里根本就不是国王
then Joffrey is no king at all

提利尔家也就把他们的宝贝玫瑰插在了牛粪上
and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.

如果瑟曦太老 给不了洛拉斯孩子
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,

我们就又把另一朵鲜花插在了牛粪上
we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.

我们不能冒这个险
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

不确定性让你很不舒服
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.

好吧
All right.

那我们就来“确定”一下
I'll remove it for you.

如果你拒绝洛拉斯和瑟曦的婚姻
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,

我会让他披上白袍
I will name him to the Kingsguard.

我相信你很熟悉御林铁卫的誓言
I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows.

他将不结婚
He will never marry.

不生子 哦… 
He will never have children. Oh...

提利尔家族会逐渐消亡
The Tyrell name will fade.

而高庭会传给
And Highgarden will go to the children

乔佛里和玛格丽的孩子
of Joffrey and Margaery.

难道你会愿意让一个痛恨你的人
You would have your grandson protected

保护你的外孙？
by someone who disgusts you?

我会让一个谨守誓言
I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior

武艺精湛的战士保护我的外孙
who takes his vows seriously.

那么 要我起草这条命令呢？
So, shall I draw up the order?

还是你同意这桩婚事？
Or do you consent to this marriage?

一个人能做到名副其实 不辱荣誉
It's a rare enough thing

真的是极其罕见的
a man who lives up to his reputation.

不！
No!

我们必须割断绳索！
We've gotta cut them loose!

不要！
No!

抓住我的手！
Take my hand!

别针好漂亮
That's a wonderful pin.

嗯 其实这应该是一个胸针
Oh, it's more of a brooch, really.

洛拉斯・提利尔
“百花骑士”

珊莎・史塔克

不过我想胸针应该也是一种别针 所以… 
Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so...

我很高兴听说我们的… 
I'm very happy about...

啊 是的
Uh, yes.

我… 我也是
II am as well.

感觉好像在做梦一样
I feel like I'm in a dream.

对 我也是 绝对是
Yes, me, too. Definitely.

很小的时候我就幻想过一场盛大的婚礼
I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young.

幻想着宾客们
The guests,

盛宴 比武大会
the food, the tournaments.

当然还有新娘
And the bride, of course.

世上最美丽的新娘
The most beautiful bride in the world

身着美丽的金丝礼服
in a beautiful gown of gold

和流苏袖口的绿色织锦
and green brocade with fringed sleeves.

你去过高庭吗 小姐？
Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

没有 来君临之前
No. I had never left Winterfell

我从来没有离开过临冬城
before I came to King's Landing.

不过听说那里很美
But it sounds wonderful.

我等不及想去看看
I can't wait to see it.

还有离开这里
And to leave this place.

这里很可怕 是吧？
It's terrible, isn't it?

世界上最可怕的地方
The most terrible place there is.

对这桩婚事我们恐怕无能为力
I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.

我们可以把他们两个都杀了
We can have them both killed.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
摄政太后

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔” 财政大臣

很难说在这场协议婚姻中
It's hard to say which of the four of us

我们四个谁最悲惨
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

大概是珊莎
Probably Sansa.

虽然洛拉斯肯定也会陷入
Though Loras will certainly come to know

深深地痛苦之中
a deep and singular misery.

父亲倒是一视同仁
Father doesn't discriminate.

我们全都被送进了地狱
We're all being shipped off to hell together.

还不是你造成的
On a boat you built.

提利尔家族暗地谋划要削弱我们家族
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.

我所做的都是为了保护家族
I did what I did to protect our family.

我也是家族中的一分子
I'm your family.

而且是为了家族的生存
A member of your family

做了积极贡献的一分子
who has actively contributed to that family's survival.

不管你和父亲或者任何人
Whether or not you or Father

是不是承认这一点
or anyone else wants to admit it.

我承认
I do admit it.

如果不是你的野火把戏
If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,

史坦尼斯就会在父亲来到之前攻陷君临
Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.

我们的头大概现在还在城门上烂着呢
Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.

那么叫人杀我真是个奇怪的感谢方式
Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.

在君临仅有两人
There are two people in King's Landing

有权指挥御林铁卫
who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

是不是你命令曼登爵士
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon

在黑水河之战中趁乱杀死我?
to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

我理解他想杀我的冲动
The impulse I understand.

他恨我因为我是唯一一个告诉他
He hates me because I'm the only one

他实际上是个什么货色的人
who tells him what he really is.

所以 他想我死 很正常
So, fair enough. He wants me dead.

但是他愚蠢的地方在哪?
But his stupidity?

他本来可以将我毒死 没有人会发现
He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.

但是国王命令御林铁卫
But the king orders a Kingsguard

在他自己的军队面前
to murder the Hand of the King

杀死国王之手
in full view of his own army.

那这孩子还真是个白痴
The boy's an idiot.

你想让我说什么？
What do you want me to say?

我想让你告诉我 我的生命是不是还处在危险中
I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.

可能吧
Probably.

但危险不会来自乔佛里
But not from Joffrey.

父亲在这里他不会做任何事
He won't do anything now Father's here.

七大王国在对泰温・兰尼斯特的恐惧之下
Seven kingdoms united in fear

实现统一
of Tywin Lannister.

提利尔家族不会
Not the Tyrells.

不久之后他们就不必再害怕他
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

乔佛里会被玛格丽征服
Joffrey will belong to Margaery,

那个眼神如雌鹿般温柔的婊子
the little doeeyed whore.

之后他的子孙也会如此
And so will his children and their children.

历史将从我们手中被夺走
History will be taken from our hands.

你至少还能逃
You may escape, at least.

只要詹姆回来
Once Jaime gets back,

洛拉斯爵士恐怕会被
Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case

一剑穿肠的
of sword through bowels.

如果詹姆回来的话 是的
When Jaime gets back, yes.

但是你觉得他什么时候才会回来？
But when do we think that's going to be?

我们都不知道他在哪
He's out there somewhere.

詹姆回不回来 我都他妈的完蛋了
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

谁去告诉她呢?
Who's going to tell her?

你觉得人们会喜欢吗?
Do you think people will like it?

我觉得根本不会有人注意
I don't think they will even notice it.

你说得对 又不是我的婚礼
You're right. It's not my wedding.

雪伊
珊莎的侍女 小恶魔的情人

总之 看得出来
Anyway, from what I can tell,

高庭的裁缝比君临的
the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior

手艺要好得多
to the ones in King's Landing.

我的婚礼上肯定不会用这么呆板的东西
They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.

洛拉斯喜欢绿色和金色的锦缎
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

他肯定会喜欢的
I'm sure he does.

他们会同意我邀请我的家人吗？
Will they let me invite my family?

他们可没问我的意见
They haven't asked my opinion.

但你觉得会不会呢？
But do you think they will?

不会
No.

珊莎小姐 提利昂大人想见您
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.

我要不要…   不好意思 小姐
Should II beg your pardon, my lady.

下午好 提利昂大人
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.

我正在试穿乔佛里国王婚礼上要穿的礼服
I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.

恩 那会是场盛大的婚礼
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

我有话要跟你说 珊莎小姐
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

好的
Of course.

单独说 如果可以的话
Alone, if I may.

你为什么要跟她单独说？
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

雪伊
Shae.

请原谅她 提利昂大人
Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.

她不是本地人
She's not from here.

但是我信任她
But I trust her,

虽然她告诉我别相信她
even though she tells me not to.

有时我们总是急着听到消息
Sometimes we think we want to hear something

但往往在知道之后
and it's only afterwards when it's too late

才明白还不如
that we realize we wished we'd heard it

在一个完全不同的情境下听到它
under entirely different circumstances.

没关系 真的
It's all right, really.

从哪说起呢?
How to begin?

这这
It'sthis

这这事很尴尬
thisthis is awkward.

1000柄剑
1000 blades

来自伊耿的手下败将
taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies,

培提尔・贝里席
“小指头” 赫伦堡公爵

瓦里斯
 “八爪蜘蛛” 情报总管

在“黑死神”贝勒里恩的龙焰下锻造而成
forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.

没有1000柄
There aren't 1,000 blades.

甚至没有200柄
There aren't even 200.

我数过
I've counted.

哈 我相信你数过
Ha, I'm sure you have.

丑陋老旧的东西
Ugly old thing.

却有着独特的吸引力
Yet it has a certain appeal.

真可惜诸多选择中
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

你不得不向莱莎・艾林这个第二选择妥协了
Shame you had to settle for your second choice.

言之尚早 我的朋友
Early days, my friend.

我很荣幸 真的… 
It is flattering, really...

你看起来如此害怕
you feeling such dread

看到我将要得到我想要的
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

打败你从来都不是我的首要目标
Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition,

我向你保证
I promise you.

不过谁不想看到自己的朋友不时受挫呢？
Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?

说的没错
You're so right.

比如
For instance,

当我破坏了你
when I thwarted your plan

把珊莎・史塔克交给提利尔家的计划时
to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

如果让我说实话
If I'm going to be honest,

我确实明显地感觉到
I did feel an unmistakable sense

一种愉悦之情
of enjoyment there.

不过你的心腹
But your confidant,

一直在向你报告我的计划的
the one who fed you information about my plans,

你想要保护的那个
the one you swore to protect...

你没有给她带来任何好处
you didn't bring her any enjoyment.

她也没有给我带来什么好处
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

她是我的失败投资
She was a bad investment on my part.

幸运的是 我有个朋友
Luckily, I have a friend

想要玩点新花样
who wanted to try something new.

玩点大胆的
Something daring.

他很感谢我为他提供
And he was so grateful to me for providing

新鲜的体验
this fresh experience.

我为了王国做了我该做的事情
I did what I did for the good of the realm.

王国？
The realm?

你知道王国本来是什么吗？
Do you know what the realm is?

只不过是一把数千柄伊耿敌人的剑融成的王座
It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies.

只不过是一个反反复复讲给别人的故事
A story we agree to tell each other over and over

直到我们自己都忘了这是个谎言
till we forget that it's a lie.

但是除去谎言之外我们还剩什么呢？
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?

只有混乱
Chaos.

一个慢慢吞噬我们所有人的深渊
A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

混乱不是深渊
Chaos isn't a pit.

混乱是个阶梯
Chaos is a ladder.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

试图攀爬的人大多失败了
Many who try to climb it fail

之后再也不敢尝试
and never get to try again.

失败摧毁了他们
The fall breaks them.

萝丝

还有的人本来有机会攀爬
And some are given a chance to climb,

但他们拒绝了
but they refuse.

他们紧紧依附于王国
They cling to the realm

或诸神
or the gods

甚或爱
or love.

这些都是幻觉
Illusions.

只有那阶梯才是真实的
Only the ladder is real.

努力攀爬才是一切
The climb is all there is.
