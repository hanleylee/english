第七季第六集  Beyond the Wall
塞外

托蒙德

琼恩·雪诺
北境之王

詹德利
“大牛” 劳勃的私生子

你还好吗？   嗯
You all right? Mm.

从没来过北方？
Ever been north before?

从没见过雪
Never seen snow before.

很漂亮，是吧？
Beautiful, eh?

终于又可以畅快呼吸了
I can breathe again.

南方的空气闻着像猪屎
Down south, the air smells like pig shit.

你根本没去过南方
You've never been down south.

我去过临冬城 那还是北境
I've been to Winterfell. That's the North.

你是怎么在这活下去的？
How do you live up here?

有什么方法让命根子不被冻掉？
How do you keep your balls from freezing off?

秘诀就是你得一直活动
You got to keep moving. That's the secret.

走路很好，打仗更好，能操最好
Walking's good, fighting's better, fucking's best.

这儿方圆百里都不会有一个喘气的女人
There's not a living woman within a hundred miles of here.

手上有啥就凑合用吧
We have to make do with what we've got.

这小子可能不怎么聪明
This one is maybe not so smart.

戴佛斯说他是个很强的战士
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

很好，这比聪不聪明更重要
Good. That's more important than being smart.

聪明人可不会跑来这找尸鬼
Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.

那么，你已经见过了龙女王，嗯？
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

然后呢？
And?

除非我跪地称臣她才肯和我们联手
She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.

你和自由民相处太久了
You spent too much time with the Free Folk.

现在也不喜欢下跪了
Now you don't like kneeling.

曼斯·雷德是一个勇敢的人
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

高傲的人
A proud man.

塞外之王绝不屈膝
The KingbeyondtheWall never bent the knee.

他的尊严葬送了多少人？
How many of his people died for his pride?

小子，你还在生我们的气？
You still mad at us, boy?

密尔的索罗斯
红袍僧

你们把我卖给了女巫
You sold me to a witch.

是女祭司
A priestess.

我得说，这之间有细微的差别
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

我们正身处一场大战当中 打仗就要费钱
We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.

我想成为你们的一员
I wanted to be one of you.

我想加入兄弟会，但你们却把我卖了
I wanted to join the Brotherhood, but you sold me off

贝里·唐德利恩
“闪电大王”

像奴隶一样
like a slave.

你们知道她对我做了什么吗？
Do you know what she did to me?

她把我推倒在床
She strapped me down on a bed,

扒光我的衣服…  目前听起来还不错啊
she stripped me naked... Sounds all right so far.

然后把水蛭放我身上… 她也裸着呢？
...and put leeches on me. Was she naked, too?

她想要你的血
She needed your blood.

对，谢谢   这我知道
Yes, thank you. I know that.

还不算太糟 她想要杀了我
Could have been worse. She wanted to kill me!

多亏了戴佛斯，不然他们就把我杀了  但他们没做到 不是吗？
They would have killed me if wasn't for Davos. But they didn't, did they?

桑铎·克里冈
“猎狗”

那你还发什么牢骚？
So, what you whinging about?

我没在发牢骚
I'm not whinging.

你嘴唇在动 在抱怨着些什么
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

这就是发牢骚
That's whinging.

这家伙被杀死了六次
This one's been killed six times.

也没听到他抱怨一句屁话
You don't hear him bitching about it.

好孩子
Good lad.

我第一次到长城以北是跟你父亲一起
The first time I went north of the Wall was with your father.

他是个好人
He was a good man.

他值得有个好儿子
He deserved a better son.

他临终时你在他身边吗？
Were you with him at the end?

我当时是野人的囚犯
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
“大熊”

但我们为他报了仇
But we avenged him.

我想让你知道
I want you to know that.

每个叛徒都会受到裁决
Every mutineer found justice.

我想不出对他来说比这更残忍的死法
Can't think of a worse way for him to go.

守夜人就是他的生命
The Night's Watch was his life.

他会誓死来保护每一个人守夜人
He would have died to protect every one of those men.

但他们却虐杀了他
And they butchered him.

我也痛恨他以这方式死去
I hate that he died that way.

我父亲是我见过最受人尊敬的人
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.

他至始至终都是个好人
He was good all the way through.

最后却死在了刽子手的断头台上
And he died on the executioner's block.

你父亲曾经想处决我 知道吗？
Your father wanted to execute me, you know?

我听说了
I heard.

他当然是站在公正的立场上
He was in the right, of course.

也丝毫没有减轻当时我对他的恨意
Didn't make me hate him any less.

我很高兴他没有抓到你 我也是
I'm glad he didn't catch you. Me, too.

你的父亲给了我这把剑
Your father gave me this sword.

把剑柄头从熊改成了狼… 
Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf...

但它依旧是长爪
but it's still Longclaw.

莫尔蒙总司令
Lord Commander Mormont

以为你再也不会回到维斯特洛
thought you'd never come back to Westeros.

但你回来了
But you are back,

而这把剑在你的家族传承了数百年
and it's been in your family for centuries.

我还拿着它就不合适了
It's not right for me to have it.

他把剑给了你
He gave it to you.

我不是他的儿子
I'm not his son.

我使我的家族蒙羞
I brought shame onto my house.

我伤透了父亲的心
I broke my father's heart.

我早已丧失持有这把剑的权利
I forfeited the right to claim this sword.

它是你的了
It's yours.

希望它能为你… 
May it serve you well...

以及你的子孙所用
and your children after you.

父亲过去经常从这上面看着我们
Father used to watch us from up here.

艾莉亚·史塔克

珊莎·史塔克
临冬城公爵夫人

他不怎么说话
He wouldn't say much.

你可能不记得了
You probably don't remember.

你总是在屋里做针线活
You were inside knitting all the time.

我记得
I remember.

有次男孩们在和罗德利克爵士射箭
One time, the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrik.

他们走后我来了这儿
I came out here after,

正好布兰把弓给落下了
and Bran had left his bow behind,

扔在地上
just lying on the ground.

要是罗德利克爵士看到了一定会打他
Ser Rodrik would have cuffed him if he saw.

还有一支箭在靶子上
There was one arrow in the target.

周围一个人都没有 就像现在
There was no one around, just like now.

没有人能阻止我
No one to stop me.

于是我开始射箭
So I started shooting.

每射一箭我都要上去
And every shot, I had to go up there

把我唯一的箭取下来 然后走回去继续射
and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.

开始我并不擅长
I wasn't very good.

终于，我射中了靶心
Finally, I hit the bull'seye.

也许是第20箭，或者第50箭
Could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.

我记不清了
I don't remember.

但我射中了靶心，接着我就听到了这个
But I hit the bull'seye, and I heard this.

我抬起头
I looked up,

他就站在这里
and he's standing right here,

对着我微笑
smiling down at me.

我知道我的所作所为不合规矩
I knew what I was doing was against the rules.

但他却在微笑 所以我知道我没做错
But he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong.

错的是规矩
The rules were wrong.

他很明白我所做的正是我注定要做的
I was doing what I was meant to be doing, and he knew it.

现在他死了
Now he's dead.

做了兰尼斯特的刀下鬼
Killed by the Lannisters

其中还有你的推波助澜
with your help.

什么？
What?

这上面是你的漂亮字迹
That's your pretty handwriting.

当初茉丹修女弄伤我的手指关节
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

就因为我写不出你那样的一手好字
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

“罗柏 我怀着沉重的心情给你写信
"Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.

我们的好国王劳勃驾崩了
Our good King Robert is dead,

他在猎捕野猪时受伤而死”
killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt."

你没有必要读出来 我都记得
You don't have to read it. I remember.

“父亲被控告以叛国罪
"Father has been charged with treason.

他与劳勃的弟弟一起蓄意谋反
He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey

要偷走我挚爱的乔佛里的王位
and tried to steal his throne.

兰尼斯特家族善待我
The Lannisters are treating me well

并给予我慰问与关心
and providing me with every comfort.

我请求你 速至君临
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

发誓效忠于乔佛里国王
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

并防止兰尼斯特家族和史塔克家族之间
and prevent any strife between the great houses

发生任何冲突
of Lannister and Stark.

你亲爱的妹妹 珊莎”
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

他们强迫我这么写的
They forced me to do it.

是吗？
Did they?

拿刀抵着你的喉咙？
With a knife at your throat?

他们有没有把你放上拷刑架
Did they put you on a rack and stretch you

扯碎你的骨头？
until your bones started to pop?

你不清楚当时的情况 我不过是个孩子
You don't know what it was like. I was a child.

我也是 可我就算让他们杀掉也不愿背叛我的家族
So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.

他们告诉我 这是救父亲的唯一方法
They told me it was the only way to save Father.

那你就能够蠢到去相信他们
And you were stupid enough to believe them.

我还记得你与乔佛里和瑟曦一起站在高台上
I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei

而父亲则被拉扯上断头台
when they dragged Father to the block.

我还记得你的漂亮裙子
I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.

还记得你头上华丽的发式
I remember the fancy way you did your hair.

你在那儿？
You were there?

我就在那儿
I was there.

站在贝勒雕像附近的人群里
Standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.

你又做了些什么？
And what did you do?

你有去营救父亲吗？
Did you come running to the rescue?

你有和兰尼斯特家的人决一死战 救出父亲吗？
Did you fight off the Lannisters and save Father?

我想这么做 可你没有 就像我一样
I wanted to. But you didn't, just like me.

我没有背叛他 我没有背叛罗柏
I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb.

我没有为了我挚爱的乔佛里背叛整个家族
I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.

你本该跪在我的面前感谢我
You should be on your knees, thanking me.

我们现在还能重新站在临冬城 是因为我
We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.

赢回临冬城的不是你 不是琼恩
You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back.

他输掉了私生子之战
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

赢得这场战役的是谷地骑士
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

他们为了我才会策马北上
and they rode north for me.

而你在哪里？周游世界？
While you were off, where? Traveling the world?

我在训练 训练
I was training. Training.

那好 在你训练的同时
Well, while you were training,

我经历着你所无法想象的折磨
I suffered things you could never imagine.

哦 我是不知道那些 但我的想象力很丰富
Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.

你绝不可能在我当初的境遇下存活
You never would have survived what I survived.

那谁知道呢
I guess we'll never know.

你要如何处置那封信？
What are you going to do with that letter?

我还没想好
I don't know yet.

你把这封信拿给谁看了？你是从哪里拿到的这封信？
Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?

你怕了 是不是？
You're scared, aren't you?

你在怕什么？
What are you scared of?

如果你没犯下什么罪过
You didn't commit any crimes.

没人会将你处以绞刑   够了，艾丽娅… 
No one's going to hang you. Well, Arya...

你害怕我拿给琼恩看，他会勃然大怒
You're scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry.

不，琼恩才不会这样，他会理解你
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

你当时不过是个担惊受怕的小姑娘
You were just a scared little girl,

孤零零的，落在邪恶的兰尼斯特家族手里
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

你知道如果瑟曦看到我们像这样内斗 她该有多开心吗？
Do you know how happy Cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting?

这就是她想看到的
This is exactly what she wants.

她所梦寐以求的…  离间我们
This is what she's always wanted... to tear us apart.

你怕北境诸侯看到这封信
You're scared the Northern lords will read it.

要是让他们知道珊莎小姐曾对瑟曦言听计从
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

他们肯定不会把你放在眼里
if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.

想想小莱安娜·莫尔蒙会怎么说？
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

她比你写这封劝降信时的年纪还小
She's younger than you were when you wrote this.

你还能说“那时我不过是个孩子”吗？
Are you going to say, "But I was just a child?"

你很愤怒
You're angry.

有些时候愤怒会让人们做出不明智的事情
Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.

有些时候恐惧会让人们做出不明智的事情
Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.

我宁愿选择愤怒
I'll go with anger.

你就是他们叫的那个狗子
You're the one they call "the Dog."

滚开
Fuck off.

他们告诉我说你很刻薄
They told me you were mean.

你是生下来就刻薄 还是你就是讨厌野人？
Were you born mean or you just hate wildings?

我他妈才不在乎什么野人
I don't give two shits about wildings.

我讨厌红毛
It's gingers I hate.

红毛多好看
Gingers are beautiful.

我们被火焰亲吻过 就像你一样
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

别他妈用手指我
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

你还是娃娃的时候摔到火坑里了？
Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?

不是摔的，我是被推的
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

从那之后，你就变得刻薄了
And ever since, you've been mean.

你到底滚不滚？
Will you fuck off?

我不觉得你是真刻薄
I don't think you're truly mean.

你的眼神很悲伤
You have sad eyes.

你想吸我的屌 是不是？
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

屌？ 鸡巴
Dick? Cock.

啊，屌
Ah, dick.

我喜欢
I like it.

当然了
I bet you do.

不，我更喜欢小妹妹
Nope, it's pussy for me.

还有个美人在临冬城等着我呢
I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.

如果我还回得去的话
If I ever get back there.

黄头发 蓝眼睛
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

你见过的最高的女人
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

几乎和你一样高
Almost as tall as you.

塔斯的布蕾妮？ 你认识她？
Brienne of Tarth. You know her?

你跟他妈的塔斯的布蕾妮在一起？
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

呃 还没在一起呢
Well, not with her yet.

但我注意到她瞅我的眼神 她怎么瞅你的？
But I see the way she looks at me. How does she look at you?

像是要把你大卸八块把肝挖出来吃了吗？
Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?

你很了解她嘛
You do know her.

我们见过
We've met.

我想和她生孩子
I want to make babies with her.

想象一下… 高大壮实的怪胎们
Think of them... great big monsters.

可以征服世界
They'd conquer the world.

像你这样又疯又混账的人怎么还活了这么久？
How did a mad fucker like you live this long?

我杀人很顺手
I'm good at killing people.

你不像他
You don't look much like him.

不像谁？
Who's that?

你的父亲
Your father.

我猜你更像你母亲
I suppose you favor your mother.

你认识他？
You knew him?

当然
'Course I did.

他还是国王之手的时候
When he was Hand,

曾派我征剿魔山
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

你手下的野人告诉我
Your wildling friend told me

你被红袍女复活了
the red woman brought you back.

索罗斯也把我复活了六次
Thoros has brought me back six times.

我们都侍奉同一位神
We both serve the same lord.

我侍奉北境
I serve the North.

北境可没有让你死而复生
The North didn't raise you from the dead.

光之王从没给过我什么指引
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

我对他一无所知
I don't know anything about him.

我不知道他想从我这里得到点什么
I don't know what he wants from me.

他想要你活着   为什么？
He wants you alive. Why?

我不知道
I don't know.

任何人都可以这么对我说… “我不知道”
That's all anyone can tell me... "I don't know."

既然我们都不知道神想要什么
So, what's the point in serving a god

那侍奉神明的意义又是什么？
if none of us knows what he wants?

我一直都在思考这个问题
I think about that all the time.

我认为我们也不必追根求底
I don't think it's our purpose to understand.

除了一件事… 我们是战士
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

我们必须清楚为了什么而战
We have to know what we're fighting for.

我不是为了那些我压根不认识
I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know

坐在铁王座上的男人或女人而战
can sit on a throne made of swords.

那你是为了什么而战？
So, what are you fighting for?

生命
Life.

死亡才是敌人
Death is the enemy.

最初也是最后的敌人
The first enemy and the last.

但我们最终都会死
But we all die.

敌人一直都胜券在手
The enemy always wins.

但我们依旧奋战如初
And we still need to fight him.

这就是我所知道的全部意义
That's all I know.

在这里你我都不会有太多乐子
You and I won't find much joy while we're here,

但我们能保卫生命
but we can keep others alive.

保护那些没能力保护自己的人
We can defend those who can't defend themselves.

“我是守护王国的坚盾”
"I am the shield that guards the realms of men."

也许我们不需要理解更多意义了
Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.

也许这就足够了
Maybe that's enough.

是啊
Aye.

也许这就足够了
Maybe that's enough.

那就是我在火里看到过的东西
That's what I saw in the fire.

一座像箭头一样的山
A mountain like an arrowhead.

你确定？
Are you sure?

我们快到了
We're getting close.

你知道我为什么欣赏你吗？
Do you know what I like about you?

提利昂·兰尼斯特
丹妮的女王之手

说实话我不知道 你不是英雄
I honestly don't. You're not a hero.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
“龙之母” 龙石岛的女王

啊
Oh.

我也偶尔英雄过
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

比如率军冲过君临的烂泥门… 
I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing and...

我不想你成为一位英雄
I don't want you to be a hero.

英雄们总做蠢事送命
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

卓戈、乔拉、达里奥
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

甚至这个… 琼恩·雪诺… 
even this... Jon Snow...

他们都争先恐后
they all try to outdo each other.

做些愚蠢至极而又无畏的事
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

有意思的是 那些您提到的英雄… 
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

卓戈、乔拉、达里奥
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

甚至这个… 琼恩·雪诺… 
even this... Jon Snow.

他们全都倾心于您
They all fell in love with you.

琼恩·雪诺才没有对我动心   哦 我搞错了
Jon Snow's not in love with me. Oh, my mistake.

以为他那么渴望地盯着您
I suppose he stares at you longingly

是想求得一次成功的军事联姻
because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.

他太矮了
He's too little for me.

我不是暗示… 
I didn't mean...

就英雄来说他确实挺矮
As heroes go, he is quite little.

你很勇敢
I know you're brave.

我不会选一位懦夫当我的女王之手
I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.

所以，如果进展顺利
So, if all goes well,

我最后会见到你姐姐
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

根据你告诉过我的她的“事迹”
From everything you've told me about her,

恐怕她会谋杀我而不是谈判
she'd rather murder me than speak with me.

事实上… 她会先惨无人道地折磨您
Oh, first, she'd torture you in some horrible way,

然后再把您杀掉
then she'd murder you.

没人比我更不信任我姐了，所以相信我
Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.

但如果我们前往都城
But if we go to the capital,

我们会带着两支军队，以及三头巨龙
we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons.

一旦有人敢碰您，君临城顷刻间就会陷于火海化为乌有
Anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stones.

她现在正想着如何设下圈套
And right now, she's thinking of how to set a trap.

她当然会
Of course she is.

而她也在想你会搞什么陷阱
And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.

是吗？
Are we?

我们要设陷阱吗？
Laying any traps?

如果我们想要创造一个美好崭新的世界
If we want to create a new and better world,

我并不确定欺骗与屠杀是开始这一切的上策
I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.

哪次战争胜利的背后没有诡计与屠杀？
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?

没错 赢得王座
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

是要冷酷无情
if you're going to win the throne.

您需要引起一定程度的恐惧
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

但恐惧是瑟曦唯一的武器
But fear is all Cersei has.

我父亲也是如此… 还有乔佛里
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

他们的权力因此而脆弱
It makes their power brittle

因为他们统治之下的每个人都迫切希望他们去死
because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.

伊耿·坦格利安依靠恐惧统治了很久
Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.

确实
He did.

但您曾对我说你要打破旧规
But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel.

而建立旧规的正是伊耿
Aegon built a wheel.

如果您想当那样的女王
If that's the kind of queen you want to be,

您和之前的暴君又有何区别？
how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?

所以我们要走进狮穴
So we walk into the lions' den.

我哥哥向我保证
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

他会管好兰尼斯特军队
on the Lannister forces.

抱歉 我可不信任何兰尼斯特的承诺
Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.

除了你的
Except yours.

而我也向他保证
And I promised him

不会让您冲动行事
I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.

冲动？
Impulsive?

这次谈判会很艰难
This will be a difficult negotiation.

我们对面坐着的是不共戴天之人
We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless.

我姐姐很可能会说些激怒您的话
My sister is likely to say something provocative.

那又怎么样？而大家都知道
And? And you have been known

您经常发怒
to lose your temper from time to time,

像所有伟大的领袖一样
as all great leaders do.

我什么时候发怒了？
When have I lost my temper?

比如说烧死塔利父子时
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

那不是冲动
That was not impulsive.

那是必要的举措
That was necessary.

也许吧 也许？
Perhaps. Perhaps?

也许您只用处死父亲 不用处死儿子
Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.

也许他们都需要在孤独冰冷的牢房里
Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate their mistakes

反思自己的过错
in the solitude of a cold cell.

我们还没来得及讨论这些可能性
We had no time to discuss the possibilities

您就把它们全部推翻了
before you ended their possibilities.

听上去在这场争论中
One could be forgiven for thinking you're taking

你站在自己家族那边
your family's side in this debate.

我确实站在那边
I am taking their side.

您必须站在敌人的角度
You need to take your enemy's side

才能用他们的眼光看事情
if you're going to see things the way they do.

而您只有用他们的眼光看事情
And you need to see things the way they do

才能预测他们的行动
if you're going to anticipate their actions,

有效的应对 打败他们
respond effectively, and beat them.

我很希望您能这样做
Which I want you to do very much.

因为我对您和您想建立的世界都怀有信心
Because I believe in you and in the world you want to build.

但那样的世界
But the world you want to build

不是一夜之间就能建成的
doesn't get built all at once.

也许终极一生都无法完成
Probably not in a single lifetime.

我们怎么确保您的愿景能持续下去？
How do we ensure that your vision endures?

打破旧规之后 我们怎样么确保它不死灰复燃？
After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?

你想知道我死之后谁坐铁王座
You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead.

是吗？
Is that it?

您说您不能生育了
You say you can't have children,

但也有其他方式选继承人
but there are other ways of choosing a successor.

守夜人有一种办法
The Night's Watch has one method.

铁民们 他们虽然缺点很多 但也有一种办法
The ironborn, for all their many flaws, have another.

在我赢得王位之后再谈继承之事
We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.

陛下，您在黑水河作战时
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

我看到成百支箭向您飞来
fly towards you when you fought on the Blackwater Rush,

也看到它们都未中的
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

但如果有一支箭正中您心脏，让您… 
But any one of them could have found your heart and ended your...

你最近对我的死考虑了很多啊，是不是？
You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?

这是你和你哥哥
Is this one of the items you discussed

在君临讨论的问题之一吗？
with your brother in King's Landing?

为了侍奉您，我在长远考虑
I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.

也许如果你眼光放短些
Perhaps if you planned for the short term,

我们就不会失去多恩和高庭
we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.

在我赢得王位以后再讨论继承之事
We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.

看！
Look!

是头熊
A bear.

他妈的
Big fucker.

熊都是蓝眼睛的吗？
Do bears have blue eyes?

咱们得把他带回东海望
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

给我酒壶
Flask.

来吧
Go on.

你还好吧？
You all right?

被尸鬼熊咬了而已
I just got bit by a dead bear.

是 没错
Aye, you did.

可笑的人生啊
Funny old life.

好了
Right, then.

咱们走吧
We're off.

培提尔·贝里席
“小指头”

她从哪拿到这信的？我不知道
Where did she get it? I don't know.

她好像很神通广大
She seems very resourceful.

你很忧虑
You're worried.

我们要让两万人
We're asking 20,000 men

在他们见过的最可怕的冬天里和我们共同作战
to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen.

天气还不是最严重的问题
The weather will be the least of their problems.

很多人都想找个好借口回家
Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.

你怀疑他们的忠心？他们是向琼恩效忠的
You question their loyalty? Their loyalty is to Jon.

琼恩不在这里 我几周没收到他来信了
Jon is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.

你是临冬城公爵夫人
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

北境之王命你在他离开时代掌朝政
The king chose you to rule in his absence.

而你确实处理了政事
And rule you have.

睿智、精明
Wisely, ably.

他们看得见，尊重你
They see that. They respect you.

甚至可能有些人更支持你执政
Some may even prefer you.

对，他们背叛了琼恩
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

就在收复临冬城的时候
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

然后又拥他为王
then they named him their king,

现在他们又想再次背叛他
and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again.

对这种人，你敢付出多少信任？
How far would you trust men like that?

一群墙头草
They're all bloody wind vanes.

如果他们发现我写了那封信
If they found out that I wrote that letter,

更何况我曾不止一次，而是两次嫁给家族的敌人… 
a woman who's already married not one, but two enemies of her house...

等到琼恩归来，恐怕已经没有士兵追随他了
By the time Jon comes back, he'll have no army left.

艾莉亚和他们不一样
Arya's not like them.

她是你的妹妹
She's your sister.

你们或许会有分歧
You may have disagreements,

但她永远不会背叛亲人
but she would never betray her family.

她会的，如果她觉得我会背叛琼恩
She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.

她真这么觉得？
Is that what she thinks?

我也不知道她究竟会怎么想
I don't know what she thinks.

她已经不是我认识的那个艾莉亚了
I don't know her anymore.

布蕾妮小姐或许能帮你
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

她发过誓会保护凯特琳·史塔克的两个女儿
She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's girls,

不是吗？
is she not?

是，她会的
She is.

所以无论你们两个谁想要以任何方式伤害对方
And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way,

她都会恪守誓言来阻止这一切，对吧？
wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?

她会的
She would.

有件事我一直想问你   问吧
Something I've always wanted to know. All right.

你率兵进攻派克城的时候究竟喝了多少酒？
How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?

老实说，我压根不记得怎么进攻的
If I'm being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach.

是几个兄弟第二天早上告诉我的
Some of the lads told me about it the next morning.

听起来是喝了不少
Sounded like a good scrap.

好吧
Aye.

你那会儿喝得刚刚好
It was a proper scrap.

铁民以为你是某个神
The ironborn thought you were some kind of god,

你当时挥舞着那把燃烧的剑
the way you were waving that flaming sword.

那会儿我觉得你是我见过的最厉害的人
I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.

我只是醉得最厉害罢了
Just the drunkest.

剩下的在哪里？
Where's the rest of them?

如果一直等下去 我们就能知道了
If we wait long enough, we'll find out.

快回东海望！
Run back to Eastwatch.

马上派渡鸦给丹妮莉丝送信 告诉她发生了什么
Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.

我不会抛下你们的   你跑得最快！ 走！ 快走！
I'm not leaving you. You're the fastest. Go, now.

不拿锤子你跑得更快 给我！
You're faster without the hammer. Give it.

放手！
Give it!

走！ 快走！
Come on! Run!

快走啊！
Come on!

停下！
Stop!

快跑！
Go!

怎么回事？
What happened?

其他人呢？
Where are the others?

渡鸦 让渡鸦送信
Raven, we need to send a raven.

去叫学士！快去！
Get the maester, now!

索罗斯？
Thoros?

索罗斯！
Thoros.

要我说，这种死法还不错
They say it's one of the better ways to go.

光之王，请为我们引路
Lord of Light, show us the way.

请降临于人世的黑暗之中 带领您的信徒重归光明
Come to us in our darkness and lead Your servant into the light.

我们得把他的尸体烧了
We have to burn his body.

除非你要光之王发发善心
We'll all be close behind him

给我们一点火种，不然我们都得像他这样
unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.

光之王
Lord of Light,

请降临于人世的黑暗之中
come to us in our darkness,

因为长夜漫漫 处处险恶
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

很快 我们都会冻僵的
We'll all freeze soon.

湖面也快冻住了
And so will the water.

你杀死异鬼的时候
When you killed the white walker,

后面跟着的死尸也全都倒下了
almost all the dead that followed it fell.

为什么？
Why?

或许就是他制造了那些尸鬼
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

我们可以和异鬼一斗
We can go for the walkers.

说不定我们有机会赢   不
Maybe we'll stand a chance. No.

我们要做的是把那玩意带回去
We need to take that thing back with us.

我们已经派出渡鸦去给龙石岛送信了
There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.

丹妮莉丝才是我们唯一的机会
Daenerys is our only chance.

不，还有另一个机会
No. There's another.

杀死他
Kill him.

是他制造了这些玩意
He turned them all.

你不明白
You don't understand.

光之王复活了你
The Lord brought you back.

又复活了我
He brought me back.

就我们俩 别无他人
No one else. Just us.

难道他复活我们只是为了眼看着我们冻死？
Did He do it to watch us freeze to death?

当心点儿，贝里，你的祭司已经死了
Careful, Beric. You lost your priest.

你就剩这一条命了
This is your last life.

我等着与死亡交手，已经很久了
I've been waiting for the end for a long time.

或许光之王带我来这里，就是为了遇见死亡
Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.

我见过的每个神都是贱人
Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.

我不觉得光之王会是个例外
Don't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.

小姐
My lady.

那上面说什么
My lady?

这是一封请柬 请我去君临
It's an invitation to King's Landing.

小姐，您才是临冬城的女主人
My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.

我知道，你将代表我去参加他们那个聚会
I am, and you will represent my interests at this gathering as you see them.

他们邀请的是您，他们希望见到的也是您
They invited you. They want you there.

塔斯的布蕾妮
珊莎的护卫

只要瑟曦还是女王，我就不会踏进君临一步
I will not set foot in King's Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen.

他们要是想再囚禁一个史塔克
If they want another Stark prisoner,

尽管来这里抓我
they can come and take me.

不然我哪儿都不会去
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

我还有很多事要处理
I have work to do here.

那太危险了
It's not safe.

詹姆爵士会在那儿的
Ser Jaime will be there.

你说过他那时对你很敬重
You said he treated you honorably before.

我不是在担心自己
I'm not worried about me.

我是说扔下你和小指头在一起，太危险了
It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.

我身边有一堆守卫，个个都很乐于把他抓起来 或者砍掉他的脑袋
I have many guards who would happily imprison him or behead him

不管你在不在这儿
whether or not you're here.

您相信他们的忠诚？
And you trust their loyalty?

您相信他们没有被他暗中收买？
You trust he hasn't been speaking to them all behind your back?

起码让我把波德瑞克留下来保护您吧
Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.

他现在是个合格的剑士了…
He has become a competent swordsman...

我不需要被保护 被担心 被照顾
I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.

我不是个小孩子了
I'm not a child,

我是临冬城公爵夫人，而且我在自己家
I am the Lady of Winterfell, and I am home.

这对我来说是最安全的地方
This is the safest place for me.

夫人
My lady,

我发过誓要保护您和您妹妹
I swore an oath to protect you and your sister.

如果我抛下您…  此去君临路途遥远 布蕾妮小姐
If I abandon you... The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne,

现在又不比夏天
and you won't be traveling on summer roads.

你动身越早，越不容易耽误时机
The sooner you leave, the better your chances of making it on time.

遵命，夫人
Yes, my lady.

您不能这样
You can't.

世界上最重要的人
The most important person in the world

韦赛里昂
丹妮的金龙

雷哥
丹妮的绿龙

不能飞到世界上最危险的地方去
can't fly off to the most dangerous place in the world.

除了我还有谁能去？  没人能
Who else can? No one.

他们离开时明知有多危险
They knew the risks when they left.

您要是死了还怎么夺回王座
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

卓耿
丹妮的黑龙

又何谈改变历史
You can't break the wheel if you're dead.

所以，你想让我怎么做？
So, what would you have me do?

按兵不动
Nothing.

有时候最难的就是沉住气
Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.

万一您死了，我们就全盘皆输
If you die, we're all lost.

所有人，所有的一切
Everyone, everything.

你之前就让我静观其变，我听了
You told me to do nothing before and I listened to you.

我不会再坐以待毙了
I'm not doing nothing again.

蠢逼
Dumb cunt.

哦 我操
Oh, fuck.

操
Fuck it.

呀！
Yah!

啊！
Yah!

撤！
Fall back!

撤！快来！
Fall back! Come on!

救我！
Help me!

走！
Go!

琼恩！
Jon!

走！
Go!

快走！走啊！
Go now! Leave!

班扬叔叔！
Uncle Benjen!

你怎么在这儿？
How?

你骑马回去 跟我一起走啊
You ride for the pass. Come with me.

来不及了
There's no time.

走！
Go!

后会有期，克里冈
We'll meet again, Clegane.

妈的，还是别后会了
Fucking hope not.

该走了，我的陛下
It's time to go, Your Grace.

再等一会儿
A bit longer.

骑兵归来！
Rider approaching!

开门！
Open the gate!

不是你要找的东西？
Not what you're looking for?

在这临冬城里 我有几百忠勇之士
I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.

远水解不了近渴
They're not here now.

这些是什么？
What are these?

我的脸
My faces.

你从哪儿弄的？
Where did you get them?

从布拉佛斯 在我接受无面者训练的时候
In Braavos, while I was training to be a Faceless Man.

那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

在布拉佛斯
Back in Braavos,

我还没得到第一张脸的时候
before I got my first face,

经常玩一个游戏
there was a game I used to play.

面孔游戏
The Game of Faces.

规则很简单… 
It's simple...

我问一个关于你的问题
I ask you a question about yourself,

你要撒一个以假乱真的谎
and you try to make lies sound like the truth.

要是你骗得过我 你就赢了
If you fool me, you win.

要是被我识破 你就输了
If I catch a lie, you lose.

咱们来玩吧
Let's play.

我不想玩
I don't want to play.

琼恩当上国王 你心里怎么想？
How do you feel about Jon being king?

你是否觉得某人比他更有资格统治北境呢？
Is there someone else you think should rule the North instead of him?

那些脸是怎么来的？
Those faces, what are they?

这是你该问的吗？
You want to do the asking?

你确定吗？
Are you sure?

上一个在游戏里向我提问的人
The Game of Faces didn't turn out so well

最后结果可不大好
for the last person who asked me questions.

告诉我它们是哪儿来的
Tell me what they are.

我们小时候都想变成别人的样子
We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.

你想做个王后
You wanted to be a queen,

坐在铁王座上年轻英俊的国王身边
to sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne.

我想做个骑士
I wanted to be a knight,

想跟父亲一样执剑战斗
to pick up a sword like Father and go off to battle.

我们都没能变成别人的样子 对吧
Neither of us got to be that other person, did we?

这个世界就是不让女孩成为自己想要的样子
The world doesn't just let girls decide what they're going to be.

但是现在我能做到了
But I can now.

有这些脸供我选择
With the faces, I can choose.

我就能变成别人
I can become someone else.

用他们的声音说话
Speak in their voice,

活在他们的皮囊之下
live in their skin.

我甚至能变成你
I could even become you.

我有点好奇
I wonder what it would feel like

穿着这么漂亮的裙子会是什么感觉… 
to wear those pretty dresses...

做临冬城公爵夫人会是什么感觉
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

要知道这些 我唯一需要的… 
All I'd need to find out...

就是你的脸
is your face.

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

真的对不起
I'm so sorry.

要是我能带它回来就好了
I wish I could take it back.

要是我们没去就好了
I wish we'd never gone.

我不后悔
I don't.

如果我们没去 我就看不到那些景象
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

眼见方能为实
You have to see it to know.

所以现在我明白了
Now I know.

龙是我的孩子
The dragons are my children.

我不会再有别的孩子了
They're the only children I'll ever have.

你明白吗？
Do you understand?

我们会消灭夜王和他的军队
We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.

我们会并肩作战
And we'll do it together.

我保证
You have my word.

谢谢你，丹妮
Thank you, Dany.

丹妮？
"Dany"?

上次这么叫我的是谁来着
Who was the last person who called me that?

我记不清了，是我哥哥吗？
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

嗯，他可不太讨人喜欢啊
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

好吧
All right.

不叫“丹妮”
Not "Dany."

叫“女王陛下”怎么样？
How about "my queen"?

我想，嗯，屈膝行礼，但是… 
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

那你要如何向你的臣民们交代呢？
What about those who swore allegiance to you?

他们都会看到你是什么样的人
They'll all come to see you for what you are.

希望我不会辜负你们的期望
I hope I deserve it.

当然
You do.

你该休息了
You should get some rest.

真正要紧的战争只有一场，它已经打响了
There is only one war that matters. And it is here.
