丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
“风暴降生” 龙之母

我由衷地哀悼 女王陛下
I'm so sorry, my queen.

他是个好人
He was a good man.

“无畏的”巴利斯坦 他们这么称呼他
"Barristan the Bold" they called him.

他横跨了整个大陆来向我效忠
He crossed a continent to serve me.

他是个忠诚的朋友
He was a loyal friend.

却死在小巷里
And he died in an alley,

惨遭蒙面懦夫们的毒手
butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.

达里奥・纳哈里斯
次子团团长
丹妮莉丝的情人

我们可以后撤到金字塔区
We could pull back to the pyramid district,

把那清场 将之作为行动的大本营
secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate.

然后我们肃清整个城市
Then we clean the city out,

逐街逐巷搜个底朝天
neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street,

直到鼠辈们无处藏身
until the rats have nowhere left to hide.

西茨达拉・佐・洛拉克
弥林贵族

我更喜欢你之前的建议
I prefer your earlier suggestion.

把弥林城所有大家族的族长都抓起来带给我
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.

但我是我们家族的族长
But I'm the leader of my family.

不要啊，陛下
No, Your Grace!

我与此毫无瓜葛，
I had nothing to do with this.

陛下！
Your Grace!

向前走

你不能这样做

再前一步

只要我开口

他们便会吃掉你们

我不开口他们没准也会吃你们

孩子们

有人说我该放弃他们

但是一个母亲绝不会放弃她的孩子

如有必要她会管教他们

但她绝不会放弃他们

谁是清白的？

也许你们都是

也许你们全都不是

也许

我该让巨龙们判断

凡人皆有一死

不想让他们吃得太饱
Don't want to overfeed them.

或许明天吧
Tomorrow perhaps.

“尽管丹妮莉丝仍然控制着奴隶湾
"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay,

山姆威尔・塔利
“杀手” 守夜人事务官

城内城外的敌对势力已暗流汹涌
forces rise against her from within and without.

在被解放的奴隶能够永葆自由前，
She refuses to leave until the freedom

她拒绝离开弥林”
of the former slaves is secure."

伊蒙・坦格利安
守夜人学士

听上去她是个不简单的女人
She sounds like quite a woman.

她孤立无援
And she's alone,

被围攻
under siege,

没有家人引导她或保护她
no family to guide her or protect her.

她最后的亲人在千里之外
Her last relation thousands of miles away,

毫无用处 濒临死亡
useless, dying.

别这么说，伊蒙学士
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

世上唯一一个坦格利安
A Targaryen alone in the world

太可怕了
is a terrible thing.

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人总司令

伊蒙学士
Maester Aemon.

总司令大人
Lord Commander.

山姆，我需要和学士私下谈谈
Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

身体还好吗？
How are you feeling?

感觉就像个百岁老人
Oh, like a hundredyearold man

在慢慢地冻死
slowly freezing to death.

我需要你的谏言
I need your advice.

有一件事我想去做，一件… 
There's something I want to do, something I...

我必须做的事情
have to do.

但是它会分裂守夜人军团
But it'll divide the Night's Watch.

严重的分裂
Bitterly.

一半人会从我下令起就恨我
Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.

有一半人已经恨你了，总司令大人
Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander.

去做吧
Do it.

但是你还不知道我说的什么事
But you don't know what it is.

这不重要
That doesn't matter.

重要的是你
You do.

你会发现担任司令不会有什么舒心的事
You will find little joy in your command.

但是运气好的话
But with luck,

你可以得到力量来完成必须做的事
you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.

杀死心中的男孩，琼恩・雪诺
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

冬天几乎就要降临了
Winter is almost upon us.

杀死心中的男孩
Kill the boy

成为一个真正的男人
and let the man be born.

托蒙德
“巨人克星” 野人

余下的自由民都在哪？
Where are the rest of the free folk now?

他们去哪了？
Where have they gone?

谁领导他们？
Who leads them?

他们曾追随曼斯
They followed Mance.

他们不会听命其他任何人
They won't follow anyone else.

那么你呢？
What about you?

戴着镣铐很难领导别人
Hard to lead when you're in chains.

如果我解开你的镣铐呢？
What if I unchained you?

你为什么这么做？
Why would you do that?

因为你不是我的敌人
Because you are not my enemy.

我也不是你的敌人
And I'm not yours.

杀死我的朋友时 你无疑就是我的敌人
You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.

八千年来 守夜人宣誓成为
For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath

守护王国的坚盾
to be the shield that guards the realms of men.

八千年来我们一直没完全理解这个誓言
And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath.

你们就是人类王国的一部分
You belong to the realms of men.

你们所有的人
All of you.

现在一切都不同了？
And now everything is going to change?

是的 为什么？
It is. Why now?

因为现在我是守夜人军团的总司令
Because now I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

你想让我干什么
What would you have me do,

总司令大人？
Lord Commander?

我要你去长城以北
I'd have you go north of the Wall.

召集所有余下的自由民 不管他们在哪 都把他们带到这里来
Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here.

我会打开城门 让他们通过
I'll open the gates for them and let them through.

我会找到土地给他们在长城以南定居
I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.

他们不会为你下跪 我也不会
They won't kneel for you and neither will I.

我不要他们向我下跪
I don't want them to kneel for me.

我要他们当决战到来时 能与我并肩战斗
I want them to fight with me when the time comes.

我要叫我们的人给乌鸦卖命
The day I ask my people to fight with the crows

就会被开膛破肚 扯出肠子
is the day my people cut my guts from my belly

再被逼着吃下去的
and make me eat them.

你们有多少人没法作战
And how many of your people can't fight?

女人、孩子、老人、病人… 
The women, the children, the old, the sick

他们会怎样？
what happens to them?

你任由他们遭受死亡
You're condemning them to death.

甚至比死亡更悲惨的命运 只因自己太过骄傲 不愿讲和
Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace.

又或许你并非骄傲
Or maybe you're not proud.

只是懦弱罢了
Maybe you're just a coward.

说一个被锁着的人懦弱倒是容易
Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

你们的人需要领导
Your people need a leader.

他们需要尽早到达长城以南，不然就太晚了
And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late.

我们的时间所剩无几，而他们更少
We don't have much time and they have less.

异鬼将至 你们的人首当其冲
The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first.

我没要你讲和来保住自己的皮囊
I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin.

想救同胞 就讲和
Make peace to save your people.

他们大多数人在艰难屯
Most of them are at Hardhome.

你知道这是哪吗？
You know where that is?

在斯托德之角的尖端
Up on Storrold's Point.

我可以给你10匹马，9个人和你同行
I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.

一周之内就可以到达
You can get there in a week.

我们需要船
We'll need ships.

我会和史坦尼斯国王商讨借船一事
I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.

那么好吧
All right, then.

你得和我一起来
You're coming with me.

你是守夜人军团的总司令
You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

他们需要听你亲口说
They need to hear it from you.

他们需要知道登上的船
They need to know the ships they are boarding

不会在大海中被烧毁
won't be torched in the middle of the sea.

和我一起来 不然我不走
You come with me or I don't go.

你要让野人通过我们的城墙？
You'd bring wildlings here through our gates?

波文・马尔锡
守夜人首席事务官

如果我们不这么做，数千男女老幼就会死去
Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

让他们去死吧 我们有自己的事要操心
Let them die. We got our own to worry about.

奥赛尔・亚威克
守夜人的首席工匠

敌人就更小了
Less enemies for us.

更少
Fewer.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
长城上的王

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士” 史坦尼斯的首相

什么？ 没什么
What? Nothing.

听着，在赠地有不少良田
Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift.

没有人耕种的良田
Land that no one uses now.

只是十数座小村庄
A dozen abandoned villages.

你以为农夫们为什么遗弃村庄？
And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?

因为野人常年累月的劫掠那里
Because the wildlings raided them for years.

屠戮他们！
Cut them down!

就像他们残杀这个孩子的家人那样
Just like they did this boy's people.

奥利
守夜人新兵

说得好！
Aye!

我们与野人打了几千年
We've been fighting them for thousands of years.

艾里沙・索恩
守夜人教头

他们屠戮村民
They've slaughtered villages.

残杀我们的弟兄
They've slaughtered our brothers.

我们也杀了他们的兄弟
And we've slaughtered theirs.

艾迪森・托勒特
“忧郁的艾迪” 守夜人事务官

你知道的 无论你去哪 我都追随你
I will follow you anywhere, you know that.

但他们杀了葛兰 是的
But they killed Grenn. Yes.

杀了派普 没错
And they killed Pyp. Aye.

杀了50个弟兄
They killed 50 of our brothers.

我忘不掉
I can't forget that.

也绝不宽恕
I can't forgive it.

你去过先民拳峰
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

你知道如果我们对野人弃之不顾 他们会变成什么
If we abandon them, you know what they become.

我们要么学着与野人共处
We can learn to live with the wildlings

要么就眼睁睁地看着他们变成尸鬼
or we can add them to the army of the dead.

不管他们现在怎样 总比尸鬼好
Whatever they are now, they're better than that.

谢谢
Thank you.

奥利
Olly.

有什么想说的
If you have something you want to say to me,

就说吧
say it.

没关系的
It's all right.

你不是认真的 对吧？
You don't mean it, do you?

和野人讲和
Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.

只是个圈套
You're just doing it to trick them.

这不是圈套
It's not a trick.

他们烧了我的村子
They burned my village.

一箭射穿了我爸的脑袋
They put an arrow through my father's head

我眼睁睁地看着
right in front of me.

他们杀了我妈 杀了所有我认识的人
They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.

我明白失去心爱之人是何滋味
I know what it's like to lose the people you love.

我明白这对你不容易
I know this is hard for you.

但凛冬将至
But winter is coming.

我们都知道随之而来的是什么
We know what's coming with it.

我们无法独自面对
We can't face it alone.

您还需要什么 总司令大人？
Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?

没了
No.

波德瑞克・派恩
布蕾妮的侍从

布蕾妮・塔斯
“美人”

她距兰尼斯特千里之遥
She's far away from the Lannisters.

这是她的家
This is her home.

或许珊莎小姐在这里更好
Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

更好？
Better off with the Boltons

波顿杀了她的哥哥和母亲
who murdered her mother and brother?

珊莎身处险境 而她未必明了
Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.

谢谢
Thank you.

您在这里生活了很久吧？
You've lived here a long time?

没错
Aye.

您认得艾德大人么？
Did you know Lord Eddard?

我认得他
I knew him

也认得他父亲
and his father before him.

史塔克们早就不在了
The Starks are gone now.

还有一个
Not all of them.

我知道城堡里的是谁
I know who's inside that castle.

每个人都知道
Everyone knows.

波顿
The Boltons.

我说的不是波顿
I'm not talking about the Boltons.

我需要给她带个信
I need to get a message to her.

给珊莎・史塔克
To Sansa Stark.

你是谁？
Who are you?

某个发誓要护她平安的人
Someone who swore to keep her safe.

向谁发誓？
Swore to who?

她母亲
Her mother.

她母亲早死了
Her mother's dead.

但这并不能解除我的誓言
That doesn't release me from an oath.

我向凯特琳夫人效忠
I served Lady Catelyn.

如今亦然
I serve her still.

您效忠于谁？
Who do you serve?

米兰达
拉姆斯・雪诺的情妇

回这来
Come back here.

拉姆斯・雪诺
卢斯・波顿的私生子

米兰达
Myranda.

我瞧见你怎么看她了
I saw you staring at her.

我要娶她
I'm going to marry her.

所以时不时看看很正常
That will involve looking at her from time to time.

你说过要娶我！
You said you'd marry me.

我是认真的
And I meant it.

但那时我是个姓雪诺的私生子
When I was a bastard named Snow.

如今我可是波顿了
But I'm a Bolton now.

不能为所欲为
What I want is no longer the primary consideration.

我有一个王朝要延续呢
I'm furthering a dynasty.

你觉得她长得好看？
Do you think she's pretty?

当然啦
Of course I do.

我又不瞎
I'm not blind.

你也觉得她长得好看
You think she's pretty, too.

我可期待我俩的新婚之夜呢
I'm looking forward to our wedding night.

但别担心 我还有大把的时间能陪你
But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.

或许我也会结婚
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

你是狗舍总管的女儿
You're the kennel master's daughter.

你能嫁给谁？马厩总管的儿子？
Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son?

你是我的
You're mine.

你哪都不准去
You're not going anywhere.

除非我听够了你吃醋的话
Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy.

嫉妒让我无聊 你知道让我无聊的人都是什么下场
Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me.

你不会让我嫌烦吧 米兰达？
You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?

永远不会
Never.

珊莎・史塔克

打扰了 小姐
Beg pardon, my lady.

我是来添水的
I've come to refill the wash basin.

噢 我不需要… 
Oh, I don't need

你在北境还有朋友
You still have friends in the North.

如果遇到麻烦
If you're ever in trouble,

就在残塔最高的窗户上点一支蜡烛
light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.

但是谁…  你并不孤单
But whoYou're not alone.

我喜欢你的裙子
I like your dress.

谁给你做的？
Who made it for you?

我自己做的
I made it myself.

真的吗？
Really?

你… 你是谁？
Whowho are you?

我叫米兰达 狗舍总管的女儿
I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.

我能看看么？
May I?

真好看
Oh, wonderful.

这针线
The stitching.

是谁教你的？ 我母亲
Who taught you? My mother.

对她的遭遇我很遗憾
I'm sorry for what happened to her.

谢谢
Thank you.

她教你这些真好
It's good that she taught you.

这么漂亮的手艺
It was a gift.

每次你穿着自己做的衣服
Now every time you wear something you made,

都能想起她
you can remember her.

我宁愿母亲还活着
I'd rather have a mother.

我知道 这不一样
I know. It's not the same.

但是 有个念想总是好的
Still, it's good to remember.

记得过去的事情
Remember the way things were.

差点忘了
I almost forgot.

有个东西
There's something else

大概能帮你记起点什么
to help you remember.

就在最里面
Down there at the end.

那有什么？
What is it?

提前说出来就不是惊喜了
That would spoil the surprise.

往前走 很安全的
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

你一定想不到会见到什么
You won't believe it when you see it.

“臭佬”
席恩・葛雷乔伊

席恩？
Theon?

你不该来这
You shouldn't be here.

你今晚挺好闻的嘛
You smell particularly ripe this evening.

给我倒酒
Pour me some wine.

有什么事要和我说？
Do you have something to tell me?

没有 大人
No, my lord.

臭佬
Reek.

她看见我了

珊莎 珊莎小姐
Sansa. Lady Sansa.

她来了狗舍
She came to the kennels.

她看见你了？
She saw you?

是的 老爷 我很抱歉
Yes. I'm sorry, master.

原谅我 我没想… 
Forgive me. I didn't think

过来
Come here.

你绝不能瞒我什么 臭佬
You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek.

跪下
Get on your knees.

手给我
Give me your hand.

我原谅你
I forgive you.

小姐 您的房间住的还习惯吧
I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.

是的 谢谢您 大人

瓦妲・佛雷
"胖子"   瓦德・佛雷的孙女
卢斯・波顿的妻子

谢谢 拉姆斯
Thank you, Ramsay.

小姐 我们是一家人了 我们北境人

几千年前便血脉相连
Our blood ties go back thousands of years.

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡公爵  北境守护

所以让我们为婚礼喝一杯
So I'd like to drink to our wedding.

愿我们的欢乐从卡林湾
May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin

一直洋溢到最后壁炉城
to the Last Hearth.

敬婚礼
To your wedding.

敬你的婚礼
To your wedding.

来到一个陌生的地方 应该挺不适应吧
It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.

这不是陌生的地方 这是我的家
This isn't a strange place. This is my home.

陌生的是人
It's the people who are strange.

你说的没错
You're right.

非常陌生
Very strange.

再来点酒
More wine, please.

我听说你俩见面了
I heard you two had reunited.

地方不错
A fitting place for it.

我猜你俩上次见面
I like to imagine that the last time you spoke

就是在这个屋子里
was in this very room.

你还在生他的气么？
Are you still angry with him

在他… 
after he...

做出那些事情之后？
what he did?

别担心
Don't worry.

北境不忘啊
The North remembers.

我惩罚过他了
I punished him for it.

他现在已经不是个铁种了
He's not ironborn anymore.

再也不是席恩・葛雷乔伊了
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

他现在是一个新人
He's a new man.

这么说吧 一个全新的人
A new person, anyway.

对吧 臭佬
Aren't you, Reek?

是的 主人
Yes, master.

喏 臭佬就是他的新名字
That's his new nameReek.

你为何要这样做？
Why are you doing this?

关于这个嘛 我想让臭佬自己说比较好
Because Reek has something to say to you.

说吧,臭佬
Don't you, Reek?

一个......道歉？
An apology.

为你所做的向珊莎小姐道歉
Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did.

为你谋杀她两个兄弟的事情道歉
Apologize for murding her two brothers.

对不起
I'm sorry.

看着她的眼睛 臭佬
Look at her, Reek.

如果你没有用目光看着一个人
An apology doesn't mean anything

道歉就毫无意义
if you're not looking the person in the eye.

对不起 为什么？
I'm sorry. Sorry about what?

因为我杀了您的兄弟
For killing your brothers.

好了 这事儿告一段落
There, over and done with.

有人好受点了么?反正我有
Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.

刚刚气氛是有点儿紧张
That was getting very tense.

咻
Whew.

您发现了么 小姐？
You know what, my lady?

当他杀害了您的两个弟弟
What with him having murdered your brothers

您其他的家人也都去世了
and the rest of your family gone...

现在 臭佬可是世上活着的
Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin

最像是您的血亲的人了
that you have left.

臭佬
Reek.

你来主持婚礼吧
You will give away the bride.

总有人这样做吧 有更好的人选么
Someone has to. What better person?

好不好?好不好?
Good? Good?

是 是 挺好
Yes, yes, very good.

太棒了
Wonderful.

趁着大家都在
Walda and I have some good news as well,

瓦妲和我也有点儿好消息告诉大家
since we're all together.

我们要有孩子了
We're going to have a baby.

我由衷地为你们感到高兴
I'm very happy for you.

沃尔坎学士说 从她怀孕的症状来看
From the way she's carrying,

应该是个男孩
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

你是怎么确定的?
How can you be sure?

确定什么?
Sure of what?

她怀孕这件事
That she's pregnant.

我的意思是
I mean...

你怎么判断出来的
how can you tell?

沃尔坎学士向我们保证万无一失
Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.

所以你到底是怎么做到的
So how did you manage it?

做到什么?
Manage what?

让她怀孕
Getting her pregnant.

我想你对这种事情应该很清楚
I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

当然 但你是如何...
Of course, but how did you...

做到的
find it?

晚宴上你的表现非常丢脸
You disgraced yourself at dinner

在史塔克家的女孩面前把那个怪物牵出来
parading that creature before the Stark girl.

如果那真是个男孩的话?
And if it's a boy?

你担心他会抢了你的位置吧
You're worried about your position.

我很清楚自己的位置
My position is quite clear.

我还是你儿子
I'm your son

除非有个更好的替代品
until a better alternative comes along.

你从未向我问过你母亲的事情
You've never asked me about your mother.

我为什么要问?
Why would I?

她怀了我 然后她死了
She had me, she died.

所以我们现在才在这里
And here we are.

她是个农家女孩
She was a peasant girl.

有几分姿色
Pretty in a common sort of way.

她同时也是一个磨坊主的老婆
She was the miller's wife.

显然 他们在我不知情的时候结了婚
Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent.

所以我吊死了那个男人
So I had him hanged

并把她带到吊死那个男人的树下强奸了她
and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying.

期间她一直在反抗
She fought me the whole time.

当然 我没把她吊死算是她的运气
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

一年后 她来到了我家门前
A year later she came to my gates

手中抱着一个哇哇大哭的小婴儿
with a squalling baby in her arms.

她说那是我的孩子
A baby she claimed was mine.

我差点抽了她一顿
I nearly had her whipped

想着要不要把那个孩子扔进河里
and the child thrown in the river.

但那时我看了你一眼
But then I looked at you

那眼神跟你现在一模一样
and I saw then what I see now.

你当然是我的儿子
You are my son.

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩在黑城堡有一支驻军
Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black.

但他不会在那里停留太久的
But he won't stay for long.

他最终还是要去争夺铁王座
He wants the Iron Throne,

临冬城可是前往君临的必经之路
and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell.

他想要夺取北境
He means to take the North.

但北境是我们的
But the North is ours.

是我的 也是你的
It's yours and mine.

你会帮我击败他吧?
Will you help me defeat him?

当然
Yes.

所有的书都在这里了吗?
Is this every book there is?

吉莉
卡斯特的女儿和妻子

所有的书?
Every book there is?

世界上所有的书 唔 当然不是
In the world. Well, no.

世上的书可有千千万万
There are thousands and thousands of books out there.

实际上 这座图书馆算非常小的了
This library is rather small, actually.

在你小的时候 你家的书比这里还多？
Where you grew up, were there more books?

我父亲不算是很有文化那种
My father's not the most literate man.

他们说学城有世界上最大的图书馆
They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.

它在什么地方?
Where's that?

学城吗?
The Citadel?

在旧镇
In Oldtown.

不好意思 我知道的东西太少了
I'm sorry I don't know things.

吉莉 看着我
Gilly, look at me.

你比我会做的事情多太多了
You know how to do a hundred things I can never do.

你可以用湿木头生火
You can build a fire with wet wood.

你会煮饭 会缝合伤口
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

我现在只能洗床单还有扫地
I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

好吧 为什么学城会有世上最大的图书馆呢?
Well... Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?

因为那是训练学士的地方
It's where they train the maesters.

就像伊蒙学士那种人
Like Maester Aemon?

我年轻的时候也想成为他们中的一员
I wanted to be one when I was young.

不过我现在是守夜人的汉子了
Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.

不管怎么说 这儿的冒险多太多了
Far more adventure up here anyway.

而只有在这里我才能遇见你
I wouldn't have met you.

啊 陛下
Ah, Your Grace.

你是山姆威尔・塔利么?
You're Samwell Tarly?

是的 陛下
I am, Your Grace.

你父亲是蓝道・塔利
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

他在岑树滩之战里击败了我的兄长
He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.

劳勃只输过这一仗
Only battle Robert ever lost.

那时我警告他不要急于西进 可他没听进去
I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened.

你父亲是个伟大的战士
Fine soldier, your father.

你看起来倒是一点儿也不像个战士
You don't look like a soldier.

不过我听说你杀了一个异鬼
But I'm told you killed a white walker.

是的 陛下
I did, Your Grace.

怎么杀的?
How?

用一把龙晶做的匕首刺穿了它
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

龙晶?
Dragonglass?

就是学士们称之为黑曜石的那种东西
What the maesters call obsidian.

我知道那是什么 龙石岛到处都是
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.

为什么黑曜石能杀死异鬼呢?
Why would obsidian kill a walker?

我不知道
I don't know.

我翻遍了所有古老的手稿
I've been going through all the old manuscripts

想要从里面找到点儿什么
hoping to find something, and all I've learned

唯一知道的 就是森林之子曾经用龙晶来狩猎
is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.

梅丽珊卓女士告诉我 亡者向长城上进军
The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.

我看见过 陛下
I've seen it, Your Grace.

看见过什么?
Seen what?

亡者的军队
The army of the dead.

如果他们真的来了 我们得知道怎么打败他们
And when they comeWe have to know how to fight them.

接着读书吧 山姆威尔・塔利
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

是时候了
It's time.

呃 陛下
Uh, Your Grace.

再等一下会不会更好？
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

等琼恩・雪诺带着野人回来 我们会多出几千个人
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.

就算琼恩・雪诺真能带野人回来
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.

我们也等不了那么久
We can't wait that long.

目前我们有优势… 人多 马多 给养充足 休息得不错
We have the advantagemore men, more horses, all fed and rested.

但我们每多等一天 胜利的天平就会向波顿倾斜一点
But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

冬天随时都会到来
This could turn to winter at any moment.

我们现在得马上行动
We have to act now. Give the order.

下令吧 破晓时分出发
We march at sunrise.

我会挑点人留下的
I'll choose a dozen men to stay

保护王后和公主
and guard the queen and the princess.

不用了 她们随我们一同南下
No need. They're coming with us.

前路漫漫啊 陛下
It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace.

她们在这儿难道不会更安全？ 这里？
Won't they be saferHere?

一半的守夜人是杀手和强奸犯
Half these watchmen are killers and rapists.

她们得和我们一起走
No, they march with us.

如您所愿 陛下
As you wish, Your Grace.

你觉得我父亲会让我去地窖里玩么？
Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?

您指的是？
Beg your pardon?

临冬城的地窖
At Winterfell.

所有北境之王都被埋葬在那里
All the Kings in the North are buried there.

“筑城者”布兰登 多伦王 还有… 
Bran the Builder and King Dorren and

到时候再说 这可是漫漫长路
First things first. It's a long march ahead.

到时候我们就得拿下城堡
And then we have to take the castle.

在那边要打一场大仗吗？
Is there going to be a battle?

希琳・拜拉席恩
史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩的女儿

是的 公主殿下 但是你不会出现在战场上的… 
Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near

关于战争我们已经谈的太多了 戴佛斯爵士
That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos.

赛丽丝・佛罗伦
史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩之王后

你会吓到她的
You'll scare the child.

是 遵命
Yes, my queen.

我不害怕 我害怕
I'm not scared. Well, I am.

你要保证等他们打仗的时候来保护我
When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.

我保证
I promise.

我希望你清楚你和这帮野人在干什么
I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings.

我用得着这些船
I need those ships.

你会拿回这些船的 我发誓
You'll get them back, I swear it.

一路平安 陛下
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

还有 谢谢你
And thank you.

梅丽珊卓
光之王的“红袍祭司”

上马！
Mount up!

擎旗！
Colors!

别动
No.

你还很虚弱
You're still too weak.

我在这多久了?

三天

巴利斯坦爵士呢
Ser Barristan?

我辜负了他

我辜负了我的人

我辜负了我的女王

你没有辜负任何人

你打得很勇敢

你还能再次战斗



你感到羞愧？
Are you ashamed?

你们是被伏击的 而且寡不敌众
You were ambushed, outnumbered.

你也无法知道敌人会在哪里
There was no way you could have known.

这不是理由
This is not why.

在战斗中受伤
Wounded in war,

不会让人羞愧
there is no shame for this.

我羞愧
I am ashamed

是因为我被刺伤
because when the knife go in

倒地的时候
and I fall to the ground,

我害怕了
I am afraid.

所有人都怕死的
All men fear death.

我不是怕死
No, not death.

我是害怕
I fear

再也见不到纳斯岛的弥桑黛
I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.

您已经给了伟主们该有的下场
Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.

如果每个伟主都得到该有的下场
If I give everyone what they deserve,

那我就是光杆司令了
I'll have no one left to rule.

巴利斯坦爵士一开始就劝我施行仁政
Ser Barristan counseled mercy

直到他牺牲的那天早上也是这样说的
when I took this city right up to the morning he died.

达里奥 纳哈里斯说我应该杀掉伟主们
Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters

让这座城市自谋生路
and let the rest of the city fend for itself.

你是怎么想的？
What do you think?

陛下 我想我没资格对这些事
Your Grace, I think that I am not fit

发表意见
to have an opinion on these matters.

你跟别人一样可以建言献策
You are as fit as anyone I know.

你知道我是为了解放奴隶而来
You know why I'm here.

你也知道如果事态失控谁会受到灭顶之灾
And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart.

所以 告诉我你的忠告
So what do you think?

我只能告诉您我看到了什么 陛下
I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace.

我看见您从善如流
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

我也看见您不断地学习他人经验
I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking

仔细地权衡利弊得失
and weigh the choices they put before you.

但是为了更好的选择
And I have seen you ignore your counselors...

您可以坚持到底 一意孤行
because there was a better choice.

您能看到我们看不到的
One that only you could see.

陛下… 女王陛下 我求您了
Mymy queen, please do not do this.

你不是说“凡人必有一死”吗？
What about "valar morghulis"?

我不想死的像个懦夫
I did not want to die a coward.

我其实根本不想死
Apparently I do not want to die at all.

承认恐惧是需要勇气的
It takes courage to admit fear.

承认错误也是如此
And to admit a mistake.

我来是想告诉你 我犯了个错误
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

关于弥林的传统
I was wrong and you were right.

关于如何团结弥林的人民
About tradition.

你的意见是正确的
About bringing the people of this city together.

我要重开竞技场
I will reopen the fighting pits.

只对自由民开放
To free men only.

只要我还活着 弥林就没有奴隶制
Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.

遵命 陛下
Yes, my queen.

为了和弥林人建立长期可靠的关系
And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people,

我会下嫁给一位弥林的世家大族
I will marry the leader of an ancient family.

幸运的是一个求婚者已经在地上跪着了
Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
“小恶魔”

乔拉・莫尔蒙
“大熊” 被放逐的骑士

别担心
Don't worry.

我没事 没地方骨折 应该没有吧
I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.

我们现在在哪儿
Where are we now?

不是在洛恩河上
Not the Rhoyne.

整天阴着脸不说话
Long, sullen silences

不高兴了照着脸来那么一下
and an occasional punch in the face.

莫尔蒙家的风格哟
The Mormont way.

咱们来捋一捋啊
Let's start over.

我为之前的事向你道歉
I apologize for before.

我有时候确实管不住自己的嘴
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

咱一路上没必要闹的不愉快
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

离弥林还有好大一段路呢 我们得一起走
We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

是的
We are.

什么能让我们的旅途更加愉快呢
What would make our time together truly enjoyable

酒
would be some wine.

可惜没有
No wine.

我是个酒鬼啊拜托
I am a person who drinks.

酒鬼就是要不停地喝啊
People who drink need to keep drinking.

要不然怎么叫… 
Otherwise, they're not...

可算知道我们在哪儿了
I know where we are.

你要带我穿过瓦雷利亚的废墟
You're taking us through Valyria.

是的
I am.

你以前走过这条路吗
Have you sailed this route before?

没有
No.

你是觉得我这个礼物不够大
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir

还得给你的女王陛下带一个她祖先之地的纪念品？
from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?

你这礼物已经够大了
I think you'll be plenty.

你知道那句话是怎么说的对吧
You know what they say.

末日依然笼罩着瓦雷利亚
The Doom still rules Valyria.

那恶魔和火焰呢？
What about the demons and the flames?

你不怕末日阴影吗
Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

不
No.

海盗才怕
But pirates are.

哈
Oh.

烟海
The Smoking Sea.

我们是在几百年前才学会
How many centuries before we learn

建造这样宏伟的城市的？
how to build cities like this again?

瓦雷利亚人在几千年的时间里
Thousands of years the Valyrians were

掌握着几乎一切东西
the best in the world at almost everything.

然后… 
And then...

那些东西全没了
And then they weren't.

全部没了
And then they weren't.

末日降临时他们紧紧相拥着回转过身
They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.

山峰被撕碎
The hills that split asunder

天空被黑色遮盖
and the black that ate the skies;

灼热的火焰直冲天际
The flames that shot so high and hot

连龙也被焚化
that even dragons burned;

这些还不是他们
Would never be the final sights

在最后一刻看到的东西
that fell upon their eyes.

黑影遮蔽城墙
A fly upon a wall,

狂风卷起巨浪 翻江倒海… 
the waves the sea wind whipped and churned"

千年的古城
The city of a thousand years,

智慧的结晶
and all that men had learned;

末日浩劫一视同仁
The Doom consumed it all alike,

什么都改变不了
and neither of them turned."

说的真好 我都要鼓掌了
I would clap.

我想 这就是了
I suppose this is it, then.

瓦雷利亚的遗迹
This is what remains.

卓耿
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的黑龙



那是什么？
What was that?

石民！
Stone Men!

石民是重度灰鳞病患者，常年游荡在伤心岭，被他们触碰到的人会感染灰鳞病

别让他们碰到你！
Don't let them touch you!

躲到后面去！
Get behind!

莫尔蒙 快把我解开！
Mormont, cut me free!

莫尔蒙！
Mormont!

莫尔蒙！
Mormont!

莫尔蒙！
Mormont!

提里昂？
Tyrion?

提里昂
Tyrion.

提里昂
Tyrion.

提里昂
Tyrion.

你还好吧
You're all right.

你比你看起来的要重啊
You're heavier than you look.

他们有没有触碰到你？
Did any of them touch you?

你呢？
You?

我之前看到过灰鳞病人
I've seen greyscale before,

没一个有那么严重
but nothing like that.

所以他们才会被送到这儿来吧
I suppose that's why they send them there.

给他们心口来上一刀才是对他们的仁慈
It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it.

谢谢你救了我
Thank you for saving me.

当然 你要是一开始就没绑架我
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving

你也用不着救我
if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.

现在怎么办？
So what now?

我们要沿着海岸线走
We walk up the coast.

运气好的话 我们能找到个渔村
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

再搞到一条船
Maybe another boat.

那要是运气不好呢
Without luck?

老老实实走着去
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

我去找点柴火生个火
I'll get some wood for a fire.

然后休息一下 怎么样？
Try to get some rest, huh?

你一整天就这一句话说点子上了
That's the best idea you've had all day.
