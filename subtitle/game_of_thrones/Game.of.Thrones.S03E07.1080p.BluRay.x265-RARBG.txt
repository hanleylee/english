险难重重

要走多久？

估计一星期吧
About a week, I think.

琼恩・雪诺
叛逃的乌鸦

耶哥蕊特
“火吻而生” 野人

估计？你连这都不知道？
You think? You don't know?

我们去黑城堡 都是走国王大道
When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.

你们和你们的大道
You and your roads.

你们就是那样打仗的？
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

敲鼓 挥旗 开道前进？
You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?

大多时候的确如此
Most of the time, yes.

在战场上 拿旗子的人怎么打呢？
How do the men holding the banners fight?

其实，他们不参战
They don't, really.

高举自家纹章已是莫大荣誉
It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

那鼓手呢… 那也是一份莫大的荣誉喽？
And the drummersis that a great honor, too?

鼓手一般只是小男孩
Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.

他们有什么用？
So what good are they?

可以提振士气  怎么会？
They help the men march. How?

呃 是因为… 因为节奏
Well, it'sit's the rhythm.

哦 你是指右 左
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,

右 左 右？
right foot, left foot, right foot?

你们连这都要人提醒？
You need help remembering that?

等曼斯发出袭击黑城堡的信号时
When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black,

我们才不会敲着鼓 好让他们知道我们来了
we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.

是的
No.

你们会点燃北境前所未见的大火
No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire

好让他们知道你们来了
the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.

你什么都不懂 琼恩?雪诺
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

她说得对 你什么都不懂
She's right, you don't.

我懂这个… 你在长城上割了我的绳子
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

我也割了她的绳子
Cut her loose, too.

欧瑞尔
“鹰眼” 易形者

你看她耿耿于怀了吗？
Do you see her sulking about it?

她懂得这是我们的行事方式
That's because she understands the way things are.

你打算跟我分享？
And are you gonna share it with me?

分享你在鸟脑袋里领悟的大智慧？
The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?

自由民渴望合作就合作
People work together when it suits them.

值得忠诚就忠诚
They're loyal when it suits them.

乐意相爱就相爱
They love each other when it suits them.

情愿你死我活就你死我活
And they kill each other when it suits them.

她懂这个 你不懂
She knows that, you don't.

所以你永远得不到她
Which is why you'll never hold onto her.

这雨会再耽误一天行程
That rain will cost us another day.

佛雷会等的 他知道我们上路了
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

凯特琳・徒利
艾德・史塔克的遗孀

瓦德大人生性挑剔
Lord Walder is prickly by nature.

挑剔？你说他挑剔？
Prickly? That what you call it?

布林登・徒利
“黑鱼” 凯特琳・徒利之叔

他大概是我见过的最可恶的人
Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.

是的，所以我们才…    相比瓦德?佛雷
Yes, and that is whyI've seen wet shits

我宁愿面对这操蛋的雨天
I liked better than Walder Frey.

抱歉 陛下
Apologies, Your Grace.

我是个老粗 平时都跟士兵打交道
Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.

泰丽莎・梅葛亚
小护士 罗柏的王后

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

我过去两年都在护理伤员
I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men,

眼睁睁看着他们流血而死
watching them bleed and die.

我不怕什么操蛋的雨天
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

佛雷大人会把这次延误当做蓄意轻慢
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

随他说
He can take it as he likes.

反正他图谋的婚礼已经得逞
He's getting the wedding he wanted.

艾德慕・徒利
奔流城公爵 凯特琳・徒利之弟

他得到了婚礼
He's getting a wedding.

但他图谋的是国王
It was a king he wanted.

艾德慕是佛雷家族有史以来
Edmure is the best match a Frey has had

爵位最高的女婿
in the history of their house.

我们都该睡了
We should all get some sleep.

你不穿上衣服
If you don't put some clothes on,

我可不敢保证不会再来一次
I can't promise I won't attack you again.

来嘛 来嘛
Attack. Attack.

你在给谁写信？
Who are you writing?

我妈妈
My mother.

那是瓦雷利亚语吗？
Is that Valyrian?



替我问好
Say hello for me.

Rytsas
Rytsas.

“Ritsas”
"Ritsas."

很接近了
That was close enough.

她知道女儿成了王后吗？
Does she know her daughter's a queen?

还不知道
Not yet.

我想 这会是个惊喜
That will be a surprise, I expect.

有很多惊喜等着她
Many surprises for her.

你现在这个样子
How am I supposed to sit here planning a war

叫我如何坐着筹划战争呢？
when you're over there looking like that?

等一切结束后
Will you come with me one day to Volantis?

你会跟我去瓦兰提斯吗？
When all this is over?

我会的
I will.

我保证
I promise.

我娘会喜欢你
I know she'd love to meet you.

和她的孙儿孙女
And her grandchild.

啊 你有了？
What, now?

你确定？
Are you certain?

你生我的气吗？
Are you angry with me?

生气？
Angry?

你是我的王后
You're my queen.

我怀了你的小王子或小公主
And I have your little prince or princess inside me.

也许都有呢
Maybe one of each.

别太贪心嘛
Don't get greedy.

就一晚 你能暂时抛开战争吗？
Can you leave the war for one night?

我爱你
I love you.

你听见了吗？
Do you hear me?

我爱你
I love you.

大多数人像狗一样交配
Most men fuck like dogs.

不优雅 没技巧
No grace, no skill.

插几十次就完事
A few dozen thrusts and done.

你得耐心 前戏要做足
You need to be patient. Give her time.

等她的穴滑溜得像个海豹宝宝
Your cock shouldn't go near her

才能掏出鸡巴
till she's slick as a baby seal.

才能插入
And then you go inside,

托蒙德
“巨人克星” 野人掠袭者

不过要慢
but slowly.

别跟捅头猪似的猴急
Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.

出发！
Come on!

嘿 出发了
Hey, come on.

你以为他爱你 是不？
You think he loves you, is that it?

他怎么跟你说的？让你作他的夫人
What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady

和你一起住在城堡里？
and live with you in some castle?

不 他什么也没说
No, he didn't tell me anything.

他很少说话
He barely talks.

我看到你俩在夜里说悄悄话
I've seen you two whispering in the night,

笑得像对娘们儿
giggling like a pair of girls.

怎么 嫉妒了？
What, you're jealous?

我当然嫉妒
Of course I'm jealous.

你该挑一个自己人
You should be with one of your own.

自己人就是你咯？
And you're one of my own?

我可从没听你说过半句好话
I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.

如果你是我的人 我会说
You would if you were mine.

我会说你美丽
I'd tell you that you're beautiful

强悍 野性
and fierce and wild.

我会对你好
I'd be good to you.

你爱他吗？
You love him?

就因为他长得漂亮？是不是？
'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?

你喜欢他漂亮的头发和眼睛？
You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?

你以为漂亮就能让你快乐？ 别碰我
You think pretty is gonna make you happy? Don't touch me.

等你看清他的真面目 就不会这么爱他了
You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.

我在临冬城长大 却一心只想逃离
Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape,

来京城 来君临
to come here to the capital.

来看南方的骑士和他们漂亮的铠甲
See the southern knights and their painted armor

来体验夜晚… 
and King's Landing after dark

无数窗户里摇曳的无数蜡烛
all the candles burning in all those windows.

珊莎・史塔克

我太蠢了
I'm stupid.

玛格丽・提利尔
乔佛里国王的未婚妻

我是个蠢蛋丫头
A stupid little girl

做着愚蠢的梦 不知吸取教训
with stupid dreams who never learns.

来
Come on.

来和我散散步
Come walk with me.

记得第一次在王座厅见到你时
I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.

我从未见过比你更不快乐的人
I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.

我由衷地希望你能快乐 珊莎
I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa,

我祖母也这么想
and so does my grandmother.

你本该在高庭得到快乐
You would have been happy at Highgarden.

但像我们这样的女人
But women in our position

必须要利用身边的一切资源
must make the best of our circumstances.

我怎么利用呢？
How do I make the best of my circumstances?

我要嫁的是“他”
I have to marry him.

提利昂大人虐待过你？ 从未
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you? No.

他待你好吗？
Has he been kind to you?

他在努力
He's tried.

但你不想要他
You don't want him, though.

他是个兰尼斯特
He's a Lannister.

但远非最糟糕的兰尼斯特 你同意吗？
Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

在这儿跟你抱怨… 
Here I am complaining to you...

我儿子会当上国王
My son will be king.

子承母教
Sons learn from their mothers.

我要教他很多东西
I plan to teach mine a great deal.

而你的儿子 不出差错的话
And your son, if I'm not mistaken,

将会成为凯岩城公爵
your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock

有朝一日还会统治北境
and the North someday.

怎么了？
What?

我儿子… 
My son...

和他生的… 
with him.

我得… 
I'll have to

我们得… 
we'll have to

如果你担心疼… 
If it's the pain you're worried about

我不怕疼
I'm not afraid of the pain.

经过与乔佛里的事之后就不怕了
Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

那你担心什么呢？
What is it, then?

即使有伤疤 他也很好看啊
He's rather goodlooking even with the scar.

洛拉斯
Loras.

有的女人喜欢高个男人
Some women like tall men.

有的则喜欢矮个男人

Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

温柔的 粗暴的 丑陋的 漂亮的
Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men,

甚至有的只爱同性
pretty girls.

大部分女人必须试过才知道
Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it.

但可悲的是 太多女人在容颜老去以前
And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little

尝试得太少了
before we're old and gray.

提利昂可能会给你惊喜
Tyrion may surprise you.

据我所知 他是花丛老手
From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.

这算是好事吗？
And that's a good thing?

会是的
It can be.

我们女人很复杂
We're very complicated, you know.

需要多加练习才能取悦我们
Pleasing us takes practice.

你怎么知道这些？
How do you know all this?

好吧 可爱的小姐 都是我母亲教的
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

I don't see the problem.

雪伊不会高兴
Shae isn't going to like it.

雪伊是个婊子
Shae is a whore.

你要娶她吗？嗯？
Are you gonna marry her? Eh?

你上次娶个婊子落得什么下场？
How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?

我真不该告诉你
I should never have told you about that.

你想要雪伊 留下就是 跟一个人结婚 和另一个人睡
You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other.

你只需在史塔克女孩肚里留个种
All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.

你的种将来会成为临冬城公爵
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.

你可以凭他之名统治北境
You can rule the North in his name.

你完全可以拥有两个女人和一整个王国
You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.

两个鄙视我的女人
Two women to despise me

和一个跟着她们鄙视我的王国
and a whole kingdom to join them.

浪费时间赢得爱戴
You waste time trying to get people to love you,

最后你会成为最受爱戴的死人
you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.

你想干那个史塔克女孩
You want to fuck that Stark girl.

只是不愿承认罢了
You just don't want to admit it.

我雇你不是让你来倾倒你那一肚子坏水
I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.

我自己的坏点子够多了
The ones already there don't need company.

你雇我是让我去杀那些烦你的人
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

我这肚子坏水是免费附赠
Evil notions come free.

陛下
Your Grace.

外公
Grandfather.

你想跟我谈？
You wanted to speak to me?

是的
Yes.

我想听取御前会议的汇报
I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.

我们随时欢迎您
You're welcome to attend the meetings

出席您的御前会议 陛下
of your small council, Your Grace.

无论何时
Any or all of them.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

我太忙了
I've been very busy.

有很多重要事务需要国王处理
Many important matters require a king's attention.

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 国王之手

当然
Of course.

你在首相塔主持御前会议
You've been holding the council meetings

而非在议事厅
in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.

是的 这是我的安排
I have, yes.

我能问为什么吗？
May I ask why?

我在首相塔工作
The Tower of the Hand is where I work.

从那儿走过来要花不少时间
To walk from there to here would take time,

这些时间我可以更好地利用
time I could otherwise spend productively.

所以如果我想出席御前会议
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

就必须爬上首相塔的所有台阶？
I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

我可以叫人抬您去
We could arrange to have you carried.

跟我说说那个东方的坦格利安女孩
Tell me about the Targaryen girl

还有她的龙
in the east and her dragons.

你从哪儿听说的？
Where did you hear about this?

事情是真的吗？
Is it true?

看上去应该是
Apparently so.

你难道不认为我们应当做点什么吗？
Don't you think we ought to do something about it?

当我担任国王之手
When I was Hand of the King

辅佐你父亲的前任时
under your father's predecessor,

坦格利安家所有巨龙的头骨
the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons

都悬挂在这个房间里
were kept in this room.

最后出生的那一只
The skull of the last of them

就放在这儿
was right here.

只有苹果那么大
It was the size of an apple.

而最大的那个像辆四轮马车
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

是的 拥有那颗头的怪物
Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged

三百年前就死了
died 300 years ago.

来自世界彼端的奇谈逸闻
Curiosities on the far side of the world

不是什么威胁
are no threat to us.

我们怎么知道那些龙只是奇谈逸闻
But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities

而非翻云覆雨的猛兽？
and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?

因为在国王一无所知的问题上
Because we have been told as much by the many experts

辅佐国王治国
who serve the realm by counseling the king

的专业人士这么说
on matters about which he knows nothing.

没人辅佐我治国啊
But I haven't been counseled.

现在正有人在辅佐你
You are being counseled at this very moment.

这些事应该先咨询我的意见
I should be consulted about such things.

从现在开始 我会确保
From now on, I will see to it

一切重要事务
that you are appropriately consulted

都适当地征询您的意见
on important matters

如果必要的话
whenever necessary.

陛下
Your Grace.

渊凯
Yunkai.

黄砖之城
The Yellow City.

渊凯人以训练床奴闻名 而非士兵
The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.

我们可以击败他们
We can defeat them.

On the field, with ease.

但他们不会和我们野战
But they won't meet us on the field.

乔拉・莫尔蒙

风暴降生 龙之母

巴利斯坦・赛尔弥
前任御林铁卫队长

他们不缺补给 不缺时间 还有坚固的城墙
They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.

聪明的话 他们会躲在高墙后面
If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls

逐步消耗我们
and chip away at us, man by man.

渡过狭海前 我可不想损失半数军队
I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

我们不需要渊凯 卡丽熙
We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

攻下这座城市不会令您与维斯特洛或是铁王座
Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros

接近半步
or the Iron Throne.

渊凯城里有多少奴隶？
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

至少二十万
200,000, if not more.

那我们就有二十万个理由去夺取这座城市
Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.

派人去城门

通知奴隶贩子 我就在这儿受降

渊凯奴隶主

古老而荣耀的渊凯

我们的帝国源远流长
Our empire was old

早在古瓦雷利亚的龙搅乱世界之前
before dragons stirred in old Valyria.

无数军队被我们的城墙粉碎
Many an army has broken against our walls.

征服这里是妄想 卡丽熙
You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.

很好 我的无垢者正需要实战经验
Good. My Unsullied need practice.

据说要尽早让他们见血
I was told to blood them early.

若您要的是鲜血 那就让它流淌
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.

但又何必？
But why?

没错 您在阿斯塔波干下野蛮的行径
'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor.

但我们渊凯人宽大仁慈
But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.

渊凯的贤主大人们为银女王
The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift

送来了礼物
for the silver queen.

在您的船上还有更多礼物等着您
There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.

我的船？ 是的 卡丽熙
My ship? Yes, khaleesi.

如我所说 我们宽大仁慈
As I said, we are a generous people.

您想要多少条船就有多少条
You shall have as many ships as you require.

你们要什么回报？
And what do you ask in return?

我们只要您乘着那些船
All we ask is that you make use of these ships.

回到属于您的维斯特洛去
Sail them back to Westeros where you belong

让我们和平地处理自己的事务
and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.

我也给你一件礼物
I have a gift for you as well.

你的命 我的命？
Your life. My life?

以及你们所有的贤主大人的命
And the lives of your wise masters.

但我也要求一事作为回报
But I also want something in return.

你们必须释放渊凯城内的所有奴隶
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

不论男女老少 给每个人能随身携带的食物
Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food,

衣服和财产
clothing, and property as they can carry

作为多年服务的报酬
as payment for their years of servitude.

如若拒绝
Reject this gift,

我将毫不留情
and I shall show you no mercy.

你疯了
You are mad.

我们不是阿斯塔波或魁尔斯
We are not Astapor or Qarth.

我们是渊凯 我们有强大的盟友
We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends.

非常乐意毁灭你的盟友
Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.

你身边活下来的人 会再次成为我们的奴隶
Those who survive, we shall enslave once more.

也许连你自己在内
Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

你发誓保证我的安全
You swore me safe conduct.

我发了誓 但我的龙没有
I did, but my dragons made no promises.

而你威胁了他们的母亲
And you threatened their mother.

带上金子
Take the gold.

那是我的金子 你把它们送我了 记得吗？
My gold. You gave it to me, remember?

我会好好利用
And I shall put it to good use.

你也最好能贤明地利用我的礼物
You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you.

现在滚出去
Now get out.

渊凯人很骄傲
The Yunkish are a proud people.

他们不会折腰
They will not bend.

不折的东西会怎样？
And what happens to things that don't bend?

他说他有强大的盟友
He said he had powerful friends.

指的是？
Who was he talking about?

我不知道
I don't know.

去查
Find out.

项链？
Chains?

兰尼斯港外的金矿出产的十足真金

在凯岩城打造

雪伊
珊莎的侍女 小恶魔的情人

足够买条船

要我买条船？ 什么？
Do I need a ship? What?

要我去哪儿？ 你当然哪儿也不会去
Am I going somewhere? Of course you're not going anywhere.

那么 你邀请我参加你的婚礼喽？
So, am I invited to your wedding?

这场婚姻不是我要求的
I didn't ask for this marriage.

我不想要 不想要？
I didn't want it. No?

她是个漂亮女孩 你自己说的
She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.

那并不意味着…

将来你操她的时候 会这么告诉自己吗？
Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?

我别无选择 我父亲…

我是凯岩城的兰尼斯特
