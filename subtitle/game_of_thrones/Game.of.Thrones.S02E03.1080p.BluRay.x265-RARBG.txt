第二季第三集  What Is Dead May Never Die
逝者不死

都出去
Out, all of you.

这杂种摸进了他不该去的地方！
Bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!

我命令你带上全部人马
I want you and your men

 卡斯特
野人

 杰奥·莫尔蒙
守夜人总司令 “熊老”

给我滚
gone.

立即执行
And you will make this right.

 琼恩·雪诺
守夜人事务官

出去等着
Wait outside.

总司令大人  出去！
Lord Commander.  Now!

总司令大人  退下
Lord Commander.  Leave us.

你做了什么？
What did you do?

我跟踪了他
I followed him.

他把新生儿抱进树林
He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.

那关你什么事？
What business is that of yours?

您不明白
No, you don't understand.

他杀掉了所有的男孩
He's killing them, all the boys.

您早就知道
You know.

野人侍奉更残暴的神祗
The wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I.

那些男婴 是卡斯特的祭品
Those boys are Craster's offerings.

祭品？
Offerings?

他谋杀亲子 简直就是禽兽
He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.

是啊 可是那禽兽曾多次
Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference

救我们游骑兵于生死之间
between life and death for our Rangers.

包括你叔叔在内
Your Uncle among them.

我们还有别的仗要打
We have other wars to fight out there.

不管你看不看得惯 我们都需要卡斯特这种人
Like it or not, we need men like Craster.

我…
I...

我看见那东西了
I saw it.

我看见
I saw...

有什么东西抱走了那婴儿
Something take that child.

嗯
Yeah.

不管那是啥
Whatever it was,

我敢说你还会见到它
I daresay you'll see it again.

现在为我备马
Now ready my horse.

我们破晓动身
We leave at dawn.

别再把它弄丢了
Don't lose it again.

 山姆威尔·塔利
守夜人

吉莉
Gilly.

你们要走了
You're leaving.

我 我一直想送你点什么
II wanted to give you something.

这是我母亲的
It belonged to my mother.

 吉莉
卡斯特的女儿与妻子

我不能收  拜托了
I can't take it.  Please.

我求你收下
I want you to.

我母亲从前用它做针线活
My mother used it for sewing.

每次她都让我坐在身边
She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed

念书给她听
and I'd read to her.

父亲发现后严令禁止了
My father put a stop to it when he found out.

我只有这一件她的东西了
It's the only thing I have of hers.

还是在我离家来长城前 她送给我的
She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

你
You

你不该随便送人
you shouldn't give it away.

我没有随便送人
I'm not giving it away.

是送给你
I'm giving it to you.

帮我保管好它
Keep it safe for me.

直到我回来
Till I come back.

 阿多
马僮

阿多
Hodor.

阿多
Hodor.

叫醒布兰 好吗？该上课了
Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.

 鲁温
临冬城学士

 夏天
布兰的冰原狼

每晚都是如此
Every night it's the same.

 布兰·史塔克
临冬城代理城主

我在梦中行走
I'm walking

奔跑 但是
and running, but...

我不是 不是我自己
I'm notI'm not me.

我穿梭于神木林
I'm running through the Godswood,

嗅闻泥土
sniffing the dirt,

捕猎杀戮 口尝鲜血
tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill,

放声长啸
howling.

老奶妈给我讲过故事
Old Nan used to tell me stories

故事里有魔力的人
about magical people who could live

他们能进入鹿 鸟 狼的体内
inside stags, birds, wolves.

布兰 那些只是
That's exactly what they are, Bran

故事罢了  那么老奶妈是骗人了？
stories.  So she was lying?

他们不存在？  怎么说呢 他们或许曾经存在
They don't exist?  Well, they may have done.

但和很多神奇的事情一样
But they're gone from the world

早已从这个世界消失
along with much else.

这些只是梦境 布兰
These are dreams, Bran,

仅此而已
nothing more.

不 我的梦是特别的
No, my dreams are different.

我的梦会成真
Mine are true.

我梦见过父亲的死亡
I dreamt of my father dying.

瑞肯也做过同样的梦
And Rickon had the same dream.

不还有些梦没成真吗？
What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true?

是不是？
Hmm?

看
Right.

这一环由瓦雷利亚钢铸造
This link is made of Valyrian steel.

只有百分之一的学士有资格佩戴
Only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain.

它代表我进修过“高级神秘术”
It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.

所有学习高级神秘术的人 都忍不住想尝试施法
And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.

我也不例外
I was no different.

我当时还是个孩子
I was young.

哪个孩子没幻想过拥有超常的力量
And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers

从此便不同凡响？
to lift him out of his dull life into a special one?

但最终 和之前的无数孩子一样
But in the end, for all my efforts,

无论我如何努力 也毫无效果
I got no more out of it than 1,000 boys before me.

来吧
Come on.

好了
All right.

或许魔法曾是一种伟大的力量
Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.

但已不再如此了
But not anymore.

巨龙消失了
The Dragons are gone.

巨人灭亡了
The Giants are dead.

森林之子也已被人遗忘
And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

 玛格丽·提利尔
蓝礼的王后 “百花骑士”之妹

 蓝礼·拜拉席恩
在高庭的王

洛拉斯！为高庭而战！
Loras! Highgarden!

拿下他！
Get him!

哦！
Oh!

认输！我认输
Yield!I yield.

打得漂亮 请上前
Well fought. Approach.

请起 摘下头盔
Rise. Remove your helm.

 塔斯的布蕾妮
“美人”

 洛拉斯·提利尔
“百花骑士”

你父亲对你并未夸大其词 小姐
You are all your father promised and more, My Lady.

我只见洛拉斯爵士被打落过一两次
I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice,

而且绝没有如此难堪
but never quite in that fashion.

不 不 亲爱的 我哥哥相当勇猛
Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.

没错 我的王后
That he did, my Queen.

但冠军只能有一个
But there can only be one champion.

塔斯的布蕾妮
Brienne of Tarth,

你可以向我索要任何东西
you may ask anything of me you desire.

只要我力所能及 便如你所愿
If it is within my power, it is yours.

陛下
Your Grace,

我恳请获得御林铁卫的荣誉职位
I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

什么？
What?

我愿成为你七卫之一 为您献出我的生命
I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours,

保护您免遭一切危难
and keep you safe from all harm.

我同意
Done.

请起 御林铁卫 布蕾妮
Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

陛下 我很荣幸地为您带来凯特琳·史塔克夫人
Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

她是她儿子临冬城主罗柏·史塔克的信使
sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.

临冬城主和北境之王
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

 凯特琳·徒利
史塔克夫人

凯特琳夫人 欢迎之至
Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.

请允许我介绍我的妻子 提利尔家族的玛格丽
May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell?

非常欢迎您 史塔克夫人
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

对您丈夫的遭遇我深感遗憾
I'm so sorry for your loss.

谢谢您
You are most kind.

夫人
My Lady,

我向您起誓
I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer

兰尼斯特将为谋害您的丈夫付出代价
for your husband's murder.

一旦我拿下君临
When I take King's Landing,

即刻把乔佛里的人头交给您
I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

听到您愿意伸张正义 我已心满意足了 大人
It will be enough to know that justice was done, My Lord.

是“陛下”
Your Grace.

而且你应当在国王面前跪下
And you should kneel when you approach the King.

无需如此 史塔克夫人是贵客
There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.

您儿子是否已向泰温·兰尼斯特进军？
Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?

我并未列席我儿子的作战会议
I do not sit on my son's war councils.

就算我出席 也不会将他的部署透露给您
And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.

如果罗柏·史塔克想谈判 应该亲自前来
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself,

而不是躲在母亲身后
not hide behind his mother's skirts.

我儿子正对战强敌
My son is fighting a war,

而非比武作乐
not playing at one.

不必多虑 夫人
Don't worry, My Lady.

战争才刚刚开始
Our war is just beginning.

陛下  杰拉德
Your Grace. Gerard.

脚怎么样了？  好多了 陛下
How's your foot?  Better, Your Grace.

这些家伙根本不知轻重
They don't know their own size is all.

好小子
Good man.

我帐下有十万大军
I have 100,000 men at my command.

这是风暴地和河湾地的全部战力
All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.

全都和您的百花骑士一样年轻气盛？
And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers?

这对您来说 只是一场游戏 对吗？
It's a game to you, isn't it?

我怜悯他们  为什么？
I pity them.   Why?

因为这不会久长
Because it won't last.

因为他们是夏天的骑士 而凛冬将至
Because they are the Knights of summer and winter is coming.

布蕾妮 护送凯特琳夫人回营帐
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

她旅途劳顿  遵命 陛下
She's tired from her journey.  At once, Your Grace.

之后我还需要回来吗？  不用
Shall I return after?  That won't be necessary.

我要祈祷一会儿 独自一人
I would pray awhile.Alone.

请跟我来 夫人
If you'll follow me, My Lady.

您今天作战非常勇猛 布蕾妮小姐
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

我为我的国王而战
I fought for my King.

不久我便会为他走上战场
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

需要时为他献出生命
Die for him if I must.

而且 如果您不介意 叫我布蕾妮就可以了
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

我不是什么千金小姐
I'm no lady.

 席恩·葛雷乔伊
铁群岛继承人

 亚拉·葛雷乔伊
席恩之姐

你来做什么？
What are you doing here?

我住在这儿
I live here.

生我的气了 弟弟？  你这个说谎的婊子
Are you angry with me, brother? You lying bitch.

不是我的错  是你自己没认出我
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

认出你？  怎么可能？
Recognize you? How could I?

我最后一次见你…
The last time I saw you...

你看起来还像个胖小子
You looked like a fat little boy.

你那时也是个胖小子
You were a fat little boy, too,

但我还是认出你了
but I recognized you.

为什么不早告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

我打算先瞧瞧你现在是什么德行
I wanted to see who you were first.

还真是没让我失望
And I did.

我把一切都计划好了 你们只需留心听命便行
The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

父亲  父亲
Father. Father.

 巴隆·葛雷乔伊
铁群岛大王

狼崽子已经向南方进军
The wolf pup has gone south

背后跟随着整个北方的兵力
with the entirety of the northern army at his back.

他在西境与狮子纠缠时
While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands,

北境唾手可得
the north is ripe for the taking.

铁种将遵从古道
The Ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days

在北境西海岸展开掠夺
all along the northern coast.

之后将势力扩展到整片青绿之地
We'll spread our dominion across the green lands,

把颈泽 以及整个北境握在手中
securing the Neck and everything above.

所有城池将一座接一座投降
Every stronghold will yield to us one by one.

临冬城或许能坚守个一年半载 但那又怎样？
Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?

剩下的地盘都是我们的了
The rest shall be ours

森林 田野和厅堂
forest, field and hall.

亚拉 我的女儿 你将率领三十条长船
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships

攻击深林堡
to attack Deepwood Motte.

我早想要座城堡啦
I've always wanted a castle.

那我的任务呢？
And what's my role in all this?

你带一条船 袭击磐石海岸 掠夺沿海渔村
You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

一条船？
A ship?

你给了她三十条 只给我一条？
You give her 30 and I get one?

海婊子号 我们认为她很适合你
The sea bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.

让我和渔民作战？
I'm to fight fishermen?

小心他们的渔网
Be careful of their nets.

父亲 我曾和罗柏·史塔克并肩作战 我了解他的部下
Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men.

他不会轻易放弃北境的
He won't give up the North so easily.

在我们夺下北境之前 他们甚至都不会觉察
They won't even know we're there until it's too late.

你懂什么战争 女人？
What do you know of it, woman?

我是身经百战的勇士
I'm a proven warrior.

你的两个哥哥才是勇士
Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead

可惜都死在你费尽心机袒护的人手里
at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.

我没袒护任何人
I'm not protecting anyone.

我只是在想 此时稍作等待 是否更为明智
I just wonder  if it's not wiser to wait.

北境完全有可能成为我们的盟友 为何要冒险与他们为敌？
Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?

与他们开战 很可能会让我们全军覆没
Rise up against them and they could destroy us.

但如果我们宣誓效忠
But if we pledge fealty to them,

他们会把凯岩城给我们
they'll give us Casterly Rock.

我们的家族箴言是什么？
What are our words?

家族箴言？
Our words?

“强取胜于苦耕”   “强取胜于苦耕”
"We do not sow."  "We do not sow."

我们是铁种
We are Ironborn.

不是臣民 不做奴隶
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

不是田野里的耕牛 矿场里的苦力
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.

我们夺取所有应该属于我们的东西
We take what is ours.

你和狼崽子在一起太久 变得懦弱了
Your time with the wolves has made you weak.

说得像是我自愿去当养子
You act as if I volunteered to go.

如果你记性够好 应该记得是你自己送走了我
You gave me away, if you remember.

就在劳勃·拜拉席恩率军将你击溃
The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.

你向他屈膝投降的那一天
After he crushed you.

那时你有没有强取啊？
Did you take what was yours then?

你亲手送走了我！
You gave me away!

你的亲儿子！
Your boy!

你唯一活着的亲儿子！
Your last boy!

就像是送走一条你不想要的狗
You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.

现在我回来了 你反而咒骂我
And now you curse me because I've come home.

你想让父亲向你的另一个小家庭臣服？
You'd have our father bow down to your other family?

我没有另一个家庭
I have no other family.

没有吗？
Don't you?

赶快做决定吧 席恩
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

有你没你 我们都一样出航
Our ships sail with or without you.

 提利昂·兰尼斯特
代理首相 “小恶魔”

 雪伊
妓女

你不让我出这间屋子
You won't let me leave this room.

也不让我  嘘 嘘 小声点
You won't let me Shh, shh, keep your voice down.

为什么？你觉得你的父亲能听见吗？
Why? You think your father can hear me?

他离我们有三百里远！
He's 300 miles away!

我没想把你困在这儿
I don't intend for you to stay here.

也许我可以让你混进城堡的厨房
I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.

当然 也只是暂时而已
Again, only temporary.

每一个尝过我厨艺的人都说
Every man who has tasted my cooking

我是个货真价实的妓女
has told me what a good whore I am.

不是让你去做厨娘
But you wouldn't be a cook.

是让你去做帮厨
You'd pose as a scullion.

帮厨？ 帮厨是什么？
Scullion? What is a scullion?

洗碗小妹
Kitchen wench.

洗碗小妹？  是的 不过
A kitchen wench?  Yes, but

洗盘子？
Cleaning pots?

我的小狮子想看我这个样子？
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

你的小狮子想让你活下去
Your lion wants to see you alive.

我们来到了一个危险的地方
We've come to a dangerous place.

我的姐姐想害我
My sister wants to hurt me.

她会努力寻找一切弱点下手
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

她不能知道你的存在
She can't know about you.

我就是那个弱点？
I'm the weakness?

这是个恭维呢 小姐
It's a compliment, My Lady.

成为弱点怎么是恭维？
How is being a weakness a compliment?

在这里说话需要点艺术嘛
Language can be a bit tricky here.

噢 我太笨了 无法理解
Oh, I'm too stupid to understand.

笨笨的异域女孩
The stupid foreign girl.

我不做洗碗小妹
I am not a kitchen wench.

 托曼·拜拉席恩
王子 乔佛里之弟

 弥赛菈·拜拉席恩
公主 乔佛里之妹

 珊莎·史塔克
乔佛里的未婚妻

 瑟曦·兰尼斯特
摄政太后

乔佛里和珊莎什么时候结婚？
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

很快 亲爱的 等到战争结束
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

母亲说我会有新裙子 一条参加婚礼
Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony

一条参加宴会
and another for the feast.

但只有你能穿象牙白的裙子 因为你是新娘子
But yours will be ivory since you're the bride.

公主在和你说话呢
The Princess just spoke to you.

对不起 陛下
Pardon, Your Grace.

我相信你的新裙子会很漂亮的 弥赛菈
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

我会数着日子 期盼战争结束
I'm counting the days until the fighting is done

之后我会在七神面前献上我对国王的爱
and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the Gods.

乔佛里会杀了珊莎的哥哥吗？
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

也许吧
He might.

你希望如此吗？
Would you like that?

不 我不希望
No. I don't think so.

哪怕他这样做 珊莎也会依约成婚
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

对吧 小白鸽？
Won't you, little dove?

请进
Come in.

你是谁？
Who are you?

我是雪伊 小姐 您的新侍女
I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

我并不知道我招了一名新侍女
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

你不是本地人  不是
You're not from here. No.

你怎么还站着？
What are you doing?

等着您告诉我需要做什么
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

我不需要告诉你该去做什么
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.

你直接去做就好了
You should just do them.

做什么？
What things?

换床单 洗衣服
Change my linens, wash my clothing,

擦地 倒便壶 梳头
scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

不是这样  您说让我梳
No. You said to brush

不是现在
Not now.

您的便壶是空的
Your chamber pot is empty.

那就去擦桌子
Clean the table.

你以前做过侍女吗？
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

是的  给谁做？
Yes. For whom?

朱瑞芙夫人  朱瑞芙夫人？
Lady Zuriff. Lady Zuriff?

朱瑞芙夫人
Lady Zuriff.

这城里没有叫朱瑞芙夫人的
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

她不在这座城里
She wasn't in this city.

好吧 我不知道侍女在你那座城里怎样工作
Well, I don't know how they did things in that city,

但是在这里 侍女要把工作都提前做好
but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,

主人不会等待侍女
not the other way around.

而且我也没有时间回答一千零一问
And I don't have time to answer 1,000 questions

或者指导你该怎样工作
and teach you how to do your job.

您希望我退下吗？
Do you want me to leave?

给我梳梳头吧
Just brush my hair.

哦 感谢诸神
Oh, thank the Gods.

我已经六天没顺顺当当地大便了
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

 派席尔
大学士

我以前也犯过便秘 大人
I've encountered this problem before, My Lord.

重权在肩
The stresses of power often have this

难免身体抱恙
insalubrious effect.

每天和水服用两滴
Two drops with water daily.

好的 真高兴身边有您这样
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man

博学多闻的人
of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.

请坐  谢谢 大人
Please. Thank you, My Lord.

我能信任你 派席尔 是不是？
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

啊 是的 当然 大人
Why, yes, of course, My Lord.

如今情势紧急
These are perilous times.

国王必须缔结新盟友
And the crown must forge new alliances.

联姻无疑是最好的方式
And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.

联姻？
Matrimony, huh?

没错
Yes.

这事我原本可以在御前会议上谈
I'm trusting the council with these plans,

但太后一定不能知晓
but the queen mustn't know.

我们不能让她干涉
We can't have her meddling in affairs

这项决定王国命运的计划
that could determine the future of the realm.

否则风险太大
There's too much at stake.

噢 是的 是的 当然
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.

我会守口如瓶的
I shall be silent as the grave.

我正在筹划跟多恩的马泰尔家族结盟
I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.

弥赛菈公主成年后
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son

嫁给马泰尔家族幼子
when she comes of age,ensuring their loyalty

确保获得他们的忠诚和军队
and their army should we need it.

把弥赛菈送去多恩？
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

记住 太后一定不能知晓
But remember, the queen mustn't know.

噢 太后一定不能知晓
Ooh, "the queen mustn't know."

 瓦里斯
情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

我喜欢这样的开场白
I love conversations that begin this way.

我打算把弥赛菈公主
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off

嫁给席恩·葛雷乔伊
to Theon Greyjoy.

席恩·葛雷乔伊？
Theon Greyjoy?

恕我多问 大人 此事如何操作？
Forgive me, My Lord, but how?

他是临冬城的养子
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

随罗柏·史塔克征战
He fights for Robb Stark.

正是 但席恩的父亲憎恨史塔克
Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks

会说服儿子站到我们这边
and will convince the boy to come to our side.

葛雷乔伊可以从内部搞垮北军
Greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within

他父亲的舰队也可以为我所用
and we can have his father's ships.

记住 谁也不能说
But remember, you must tell no one.

不能说什么？
Tell no one what?

 培提尔·贝里席
财政大臣 “小指头”

我打算把弥赛菈公主嫁给谷地的罗宾·艾林
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

莱莎虽不喜欢我
Lysa is not fond of me.

但是也许王室婚约
But perhaps the promise of a royal match

能够让她不计前嫌
will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

她把你投下了狱
She imprisoned you.

差点还结果了你
She tried to execute you.

你居然打算给她儿子配个公主？
And you offer her son a princess?

身处此境
For men in our position, holding grudges can be

记恨只会是累赘 不是吗？
an encumbrance, don't you think?

你打算让我去促成这门亲事？
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?

还能有谁呢？
Who better?

没错 只要我愿意
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,

我可以去跟莱莎说定这事
if I cared to.

但这对我有什么好处？
What's in it for me?

维斯特洛的民众会感激你
The gratitude of the people of Westeros

结束了这场战争
for helping to end this war,

国王也会感谢你夺回了谷地
the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold...

还有赫伦堡
and Harrenhal.

赫伦堡是个不祥之地
Harrenhal is cursed.

没想到你也信这些东西
Never took you for a superstitious man.

随你自便 推倒再建个呗
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.

不用担心经费
You'll be able to afford it.

我还打算让你统领河间地呢
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

仅仅张张嘴 你就让我跻身于
With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the

王国最显赫的贵族之列？
greatest lords in the realm.

你一直为我的家族尽心尽力
You served my family well in the matter of the succession.

杰诺斯·史林特也一样 他受封赫伦堡
So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.

又被你收回
Until you snatched it away.

我需要你把莱莎·艾林争取过来
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.

我可不需要杰诺斯·史林特
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

就这么说定了？
It's settled, then?

很好
Good.

噢 对了
Oh, and remember

太后一定不能知晓
the queen mustn't know.

一定很疼
That must hurt.

怎么？
What?

怎么了？
What is it?

她也配做御林铁卫？
A member of the Kingsguard?

好像我还没被羞辱够似的
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

布蕾妮武艺超群
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

忠心耿耿
And she's devoted to me.

你在吃醋
You're jealous.

吃醋？
Jealous?

吃“美人”布蕾妮的醋？
Of Brienne the beauty?

别开玩笑了
Don't make me laugh.

我来补偿你  不 陛下
I'll make it up to you.  No, Your Grace.

今晚不行
Not tonight.

今晚你该属于另外一个提利尔
There's another Tyrell who requires your attention.

仅凭个人魅力
You didn't win my father's support

你赢不到我父亲的支持和军队
or his army on charm alone.

你的封臣都在背后议论你
Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.

新娘成婚半个月了 居然还是处女
Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.

玛格丽是处女？

Officially.

要我带她过来吗？
Shall I bring her to you?

我先提醒你
I should warn you,

我喝得有点多
I've had quite a bit of wine.

你是国王 你做什么都没错
As is your right. You are a King.

你今晚很漂亮
You look very beautiful.

谢谢陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

衣服很好看  您喜欢？
It's a lovely gown.  You think so?

我不知道怎么穿更好
I can't decide how I like it better.

这样
This way...

还是这样
or this way.

你没必要这么做
You certainly don't need it.

虽然…
Although...

人们说含蓄的美
some say that beauty most desired

才最是撩拨心弦
is the beauty concealed.

该是那酒
Must be the wine.

来 让我来
Here, let me.

对不起
I'm sorry.

要让我哥哥进来帮忙吗？
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

什么？  他能让你硬起来
What?  He could get you started.

我知道他不会介意的
I know he wouldn't mind.

要不然我转个身 您可以假装我是他
Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.

我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

您没必要跟我绕弯子
There's no need for us to play games.

谎话留到宫廷上说吧 没必要浪费在这里
Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.

您的敌人不喜欢我们联姻
Your enemies aren't happy about us.

想要拆散我们
They want to tear us apart.

要阻止他们
And the best way to stop them

最好是让我
is to put your baby

给你生个孩子
in my belly.

我们可以慢慢来
We can try again later.

跟我做也好
You decide how you want to do it

加上洛拉斯一起来也好
with me, with me and Loras.

你想怎样都行
However else you like.

你要做什么都可以
Whatever you need to do.

你是国王
You are a King.

你这混蛋
You monster.

我就弥赛菈这一个女儿
Myrcella is my only daughter.

你居然认为我会任你把她当妓女卖了？
Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

弥赛菈是王国的公主
Myrcella's a Princess.

这是她与生俱来的使命
Some would say she was born for this.

我绝不同意你把她装船卖给多恩人
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne

就像我当年被卖给劳勃·拜拉席恩一样！
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

在多恩她会很安全
Dorne is the safest place or her.

你疯了吗？马泰尔家族恨我们入骨
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

所以我们才要拉拢他们
That's why we need to seduce them.

在这场你儿子掀起的战争中
We're going to need their support in the war

我们需要他们的支持
your son started.

她是去做人质  是贵宾
She'll be a hostage.  A guest.

我跟你没完
You won't get away with this.

你以为父亲给你的那张纸就能当挡箭牌了？
You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe.

奈德·史塔克也有一张
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

已经决定了 瑟曦  不
It's done, Cersei.  No.

不可能回头  不！
You cannot stop it.  No!

倘若君临城破弥赛菈又岂会安全？
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?

你想要她跟坦格利安家族的孩子一样被强暴 屠杀吗？
Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?

别犯糊涂了
Make no mistake.

他们会把弥赛菈的漂亮脑袋插在你旁边
They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.

滚！滚！
Get out! Get out!

罗柏



我希望你看到此信时还不算太晚,我父亲他拒绝了你的提议



并且密谋偷袭北境，铁舰队将劫掠沿海并进军深林堡



你要尽快召集人手做好防备，否则一切就将太迟了



一旦有机会，我会继续和你联系！

我是您忠诚的仆人

你把我的计划告诉太后
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans

真是太忠诚了
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

不！不对！
No! Never!

这不是实情 我发誓
It's a falsehood. I swear it.

不是我走漏的消息
It wasn't me.

啊 瓦里斯

See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.

对小指头说把弥赛菈嫁给罗宾·艾林
I told Little finger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.

至于将弥赛菈送去多恩
I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.

只对你提过
No one but you.

到处都是太监的小小鸟儿
The eunuch has spies everywhere.

把他的命根子剁了喂山羊

Lord Arryn, he knew.

他知道关于太后的真相
He knew the truth about the queen.

而且 他想采取行动
And, well, he planned to act,

告诉劳勃国王
to tell King Robert.

所以你抢先毒死了他
So you poisoned him?

不 没有！
No. Never.

但你放任他死去 确保他一命呜呼
But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.

兰尼斯特 我做的一切都是为了兰尼斯特
LannisterI always served Lannister.

把他带走 扔进黑牢
Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.

但我是不是该担心一下？
But should I be worried?

A king, a priest and a rich man.

有个出身寒微的佣兵站在他们中间

每位显赫之人都命令他杀死另外两人
Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two.

孰生？孰死？
Who lives, who dies?

这得看那个佣兵了
Depends on the Sellsword.

是吗？他既无王冠
Does it? He has neither crown

也无财宝 更无神佑
nor gold nor favor with the Gods.

他有把剑呐 权掌生死
He has a sword,the power of life and death.

既然手握刀剑之人决定生死
But if it's swordsmen who rule,

我们何尝假装国王统治一切？
why do we pretend Kings hold all the power?

奈德·史塔克被砍头
When Ned Stark lost his head,

谁是真正的责任人？
who was truly responsible?

乔佛里？刽子手？
Joffrey? The executioner?

还是…另有其人？
Or something else?

我现在认为我不喜欢谜语了
I've decided I don't like riddles.

也能投下遮天巨影
can cast a very large shadow.

It got to the point

每晚上床睡觉之前 我都要默念他的名字

A prayer almost.

直到有一天…
Well, one day...

Willem came riding back into town.

我一斧子奋力砸进他的脑壳

they had to bury him with it.
