根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》改编
原著 乔治・R・R・马丁

第一季第二集  The Kingsroad 
国王大道

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
卡丽熙

喝点水吧 孩子
You need to drink, child.

乔拉・莫尔蒙

再吃点东西
And eat.

就没别的可吃吗？
Isn't there anything else?

多斯拉克人只有两样宝：
The Dothraki have two things in abundance:

草和骏马 可惜人不能吃草
Grass and horses. People can't live on grass.

在亚夏彼方的阴影之地
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,

据说有一片鬼草原
they say there are fields of ghost grass

鬼草的茎杆白得像白璃 夜里还会发光
with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.

这种草会杀死其余的草
It murders all other grass.

多斯拉克人相信
The Dothraki believe that one day

有朝一日鬼草会占据全世界…那便是世界的末日
it will cover everythingthat's the way the world will end.

习惯了就好了
It'll get easier.

卡丽熙！
Khaleesi!

您的手…
Your hands.

我们离开潘托斯还不远 陛下
We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace.

伊利里欧总督愿意继续款待您
Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality.

在他那儿您会住得舒适
You'd be more comfortable there.

我不在乎他的款待或者舒适生活
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.

韦赛里斯・坦格利安
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的二哥

我要盯着这个卓戈
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills

直到他兑现交易 直到我得到王冠为止
his end of the bargain and I have my crown.

如您所愿 陛下
As you wish, your Grace.

莫尔蒙 你就这么亡命天涯
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,

是怕回七国被砍头么？
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

你究竟怎么得罪奈德・史塔克的
What did Ned Stark want you for?

据说是跟奴隶贩子做交易？
Buying from a slaver?

不 我是把抓到的盗猎者
Selling to one

卖给了奴隶贩子
some poachers I caught on my land.

你尽管放心 在我治下
Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.

人们才不会因为这区区小事而受罚
You can rest assured of that.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
王后幼弟 "小恶魔"

舅舅 昨晚的相好这么漂亮啊
Betterlooking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
大王子

我妈妈在找你
My mother's been looking for you.

我们今天就要回君临了
We ride for King's Landing today.

出发之前 你得去拜见史塔克公爵和史塔克夫人
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark

向他们表达你的慰问
and offer your sympathies.

我的慰问对他们有什么用？
What good will my sympathies do them?

一点用都没有 但这是应尽的礼数
None. But it is expected of you.

大家已经注意到你刻意缺席了
Your absence has already been noted.

那小屁孩算什么东西
The boy means nothing to me.

我可不想去听老女人哭哭啼啼
And I can't stand the wailing of women.

你敢再说一句 我就再赏你一耳光
One word and I'll hit you again.

我要去告诉妈妈！
I'm telling mother!

去啊！随你去说
Go! Tell her.

但首先你给我去拜见史塔克公爵夫妇
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

我要你在他们面前跪下
and you will fall on your knees in front of them

说你感到非常遗憾 说你愿意为他们赴汤蹈火
and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service,

最后还要献上你最虔诚的祝祷 你听懂了没有？
and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?

你竟敢…
You can't

听懂了没有？
Do you understand?

桑铎・克里冈
御林铁卫 “猎狗”

小少爷 王子是不会忘记您刚才的举动的
The prince will remember that, little lord.

他记得最好
I hope so.

哪天要是他忘了 你这条狗可要好好提醒他
If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.

啊哈 该吃早饭了
Ah. Time for breakfast.

我要面包 两条这种小鱼
Bread. And two of those little fish.

再配上一杯上好的黑啤酒
And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.

培根 煎焦一点
And bacon, burned black.

小弟弟 亲爱的老哥老姐
Little brother. Beloved siblings.

瑟曦・兰尼斯特
王后

布兰会死吗？
Is Bran going to die?

看来不会
Apparently not.

弥赛・拜拉席恩
二公主

你这话什么意思？ 学士说那孩子活下来的机会很大
What do you mean? The Maester says the boy may live.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫 王后的孪生弟弟

老天真残忍 竟让一个年幼的孩子苟延残喘
It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.

这些事本该由诸神定夺
Only the gods know for certain.

我们能做的只是祈祷
All the rest of us can do is pray.

你们似乎对北国风光无动于衷啊
The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.

我仍不相信你要独自行动
I still can't believe you're going.

即便对你 这也太荒唐了
It's ridiculous even for you.

你的好奇心都哪去了？
Where's your sense of wonder?

对世界上最伟大的建筑 最英勇的守夜人战士
The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

托曼・拜拉席恩
三王子

最可怕的异鬼巢穴就没有一丝兴趣么？
the wintry abode of the White Walkers.

别说你想去当黑衣弟兄啦
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.

然后打一辈子光棍？那怎么成
And go celibate? The whores would go begging

从多恩领到凯岩城 全国的妓女都会抗议的
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

放心 我不过是想爬上长城
No, I just want to stand on top of the wall

对着世界的边缘洒泡尿罢了
and piss off the edge of the world.

别当着孩子们的面说这种粗话
The children don't need to hear your filth.

我们走
Come.

就算那孩子活下来 也成了跛子 甚至是个畸形怪胎
Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

我宁可干脆利落地去死
Give me a good clean death any day.

畸形怪胎…嘿 不是我多嘴
Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree.

死了就什么都没了 活着嘛…
Death is so final, whereas life...

活着起码充满各种可能
Ah, life is full of possibilities.

我真心希望那孩子活过来
I hope the boy does wake.

我想听听他还知道些什么
I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.

我亲爱的好弟弟
My dear brother,

有时候我真不知道你站在哪一边
there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.

我最亲爱的哥哥 你这话好伤我的心
My dear brother, you wound me.

你难道不知我对我家人的感情有多深吗？
You know how much I love my family.

凯特琳・徒利
临冬城公爵夫人

布兰・史塔克
临冬城公爵次子

不必多礼
Please.

噢 请原谅我不及更衣 陛下
Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.

没关系 你是主我是客
This is your home. I'm your guest.

他真漂亮 是不是？
Handsome one, isn't he?

我夭折的头胎 也是个黑发的漂亮男孩
I lost my first boy, a little blackhaired beauty.

也是个战士…
He was a fighter too

和带走他的热病斗争到最后
tried to beat the fever that took him.

抱歉
Forgive me.

这大概是你现在最不想听的话了
It's the last thing you need to hear right now.

我从未听说过这件事
I never knew.

陈年往事了
It was years ago.

劳勃发狂似地锤墙 直到满手是血
Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall,

这是男人们表达悲伤的方式
all the things men do to show you how much they care.

我那孩子长得就跟他一模一样
The boy looked just like him.

他那么小…
Such a little thing...

还是一只没长羽毛的雏鸟
A bird without feathers.

他们带走他时 劳勃抱住了我
They came to take his body away and Robert held me.

我尖叫着使劲挣扎 但他死死地抱住了我
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

那个小襁褓
That little bundle.

就这样从我的世界里消失了 我再也没有见过他
They took him away and I never saw him again.

我没有去过墓窖 永远也不会去
Never have visited the crypt, never.

每天早晚 我都向圣母祈祷
I pray to the mother every morning and night

祈祷她把孩子送回给你
that she return your child to you.

我很感激
I am grateful.

也许这次她能回应我罢
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

打把好剑去长城？
A sword for the wall?

琼恩・雪诺
临冬城公爵的私生子

我已经有一把好剑了 很好
I already have one. Good man.

那你使过它吗？ 当然使过
Have you swung it yet? Of course I have.

我的意思是 往人身上招呼
At someone, I mean.

头一次砍人的感觉是最难忘的
It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man.

你突然意识到人不过就是
You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat

骨头支着的血肉皮囊
and blood and some bone to keep it all standing.

让我提前跟你道个谢吧
Let me thank you ahead of time

保护芸芸众生免遭长城之外的
for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall

野人 异鬼等各路妖魔鬼怪的侵袭
Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot.

有你这样强壮的好人来牺牲奉献
We're grateful to have

我们怎能不心怀感激
good, strong men like you protecting us.

我们保护王国都超过八千年了
We've guarded the kingdoms for 8,000 years.

这就“我们”啦？
Is it "we" already?

你发过誓吗？
Have you taken your vows then?

我很快就会
Soon enough.

请代表我向守夜人军团致敬
Give my regards to The Night's Watch.

在这样的精英部队里服役一定非常刺激
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.

倘若不如人意？
And if not?

反正也是当兵吃粮喽
It's only for life.

密肯
临冬城的铁匠

谢谢 娜梅莉亚
Thank you, Nymeria.

艾莉亚・史塔克
临冬城公爵次女

茉丹修女说我没把衣服摺得漂漂亮亮的
Septa Mordane says I have to do it again.

所以得重新来过
My things weren't properly folded, she says.

谁管它们有没有摺好啊？！
Who cares how they're folded?!

反正这些衣服迟早也要乱成一团
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

还好你有帮手嘛
It's good you've got help.

看好了
Watch.

娜梅莉亚 手套
Nymeria, gloves.

厉害嘛 闭嘴
Impressive. Shut up.

娜梅莉亚！手套！
Nymeria, gloves!

我有样东西给你
I have something for you.

这东西必须妥善地藏好
And it has to be packed very carefully.

是礼物？
A present?

去把门关起来
Close the door.

这可不是玩具
This is no toy.

小心不要伤到自己
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

它好细啊 跟你一样
It's so skinny. So are you.

我请铁匠特别为你打造的
I had the blacksmith make it for you special.

它虽无法斩人首级
It won't hack a man's head off,

但只要你动作够快 却可以将敌人刺得千疮百孔
but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.

我动作很快呢
I can be quick.

你以后要天天练习
You'll have to work at it every day.

感觉如何？
How does it feel?

还顺手吗？
Do you like the balance?

我觉得蛮不错
I think so.

第一课：用尖的那端去刺敌人
First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.

我知道该用那一边刺人啦
I know which end to use.

我会想念你的
I'm going to miss you.

当心点
Careful.

你知道 大凡好剑都有自己的名讳
All the best swords have names, you know.

珊莎有她的缝衣针
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

我也有我的“缝衣针”
I've got a needle of my own.

我来向布兰道别
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

你已经达到了目的 走吧
You've said it.

我多希望 当你醒来时我能陪在你身边
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

但我这就得随班杨叔叔北上
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

加入黑衣军团
I'm taking the black.

我们总说要一起去看长城
I know we always talked about seeing the wall together,

等你好起来了 可以来黑城堡找我
but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.

这期间我会加倍努力
I'll know my way around by then.

我会成为一名合格的守夜人弟兄
I'll be a sworn brother of The Night's Watch.

如果你不怕的话 我们甚至可以去长城之外冒险
We can go out walking beyond the wall, if you're not afraid.

你给我
I want you

走开
to leave.

艾德・史塔克
临冬城公爵 昵称“奈德”

十七年前
17 years ago

你不声不响地追随劳勃・拜拉席恩踏上征程
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

一年之后 你带着别的女人的儿子回到我身边
You came back a year later with another woman's son.

现在你又要离开我
And now you're leaving again.

我别无选择
I have no choice.

这不过是男人为了荣誉找的借口
That's what men always say when honor calls.

这是他们搪塞家人 搪塞自己的谎话
That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves.

你当然可以选择
You do have a choice.

你已经做出了选择
And you've made it.

凯特…
Cat

我承受不了 奈德
I can't do it, Ned.

承受不了… 你得忍耐
I really can't. You can.

你必须忍耐
You must.

你跟布兰道别过了吗？
You've said goodbye to Bran

罗柏・史塔克
临冬城公爵长子

我知道他不会死
He's not going to die. I know it.

你们史塔克的命的确很硬
You Starks are hard to kill.

我母亲她…？
My mother?

她待我很亲切 那就好
She was very kind. Good.

下次碰面 你就全身黑衣黑甲了
Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.

黑色一直很配我
It was always my color.

雪诺 多保重 史塔克 你也一样
Farewell, Snow. And you, Stark.

加入长城守军是至高的荣誉
There's great honor serving in The Night's Watch.

数千年来 史塔克家人前仆后继地守护着北境
The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years.

而你正是一位史塔克
And you are a Stark.

你没有我的姓
You might not have my name,

却流着我的血
but you have my blood.

我母亲还活着吗？
Is my mother alive?

她知道我的情况吗？她可知我现在何处 又将去往何方？
Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going?

她在乎过我吗？
Does she care?

下次相见
The next time we see each other,

咱们就来谈谈你母亲
we'll talk about your mother.

嗯?
Huh?

我保证
I promise.

诸神在上 这才叫北国风光！
Gods, this is country!

劳勃・拜拉席恩
国王

我真想丢下他们 一路骑下去
I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.

正有此意
I've half a mind to go with you.

就咱俩如何？
What do you say, just you and me

沿着这条国王大道 行侠仗义
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

晚上便找对儿酒店侍女暖床
a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.

二十年前我或许会考虑
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

当时咱们有仗可打 又都没老婆
There were wars to fight, women to marry

现下可没那么风流快活了
we never had the chance to be young.

我倒是想起几桩风流事
I recall a few chances.

那个她…噢 叫什么来着？
There was that one... Oh, what was her name?

跟你一起的平民姑娘
That common girl of yours?

叫蓓卡？就是奶子大得你能把脸埋进去的那个
Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.

蓓茜 她明明是你的老相好
Bessie. She was one of yours.

蓓茜！感谢诸神 为蓓茜
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie

也为她那对奶子
and her tits.

你的那个叫…雅莉娜？
Yours was... Aleena?

不对 你跟我提过一次 梅莉儿？
No. You told me once. Meryl?

就你私生子的娘
Your bastard's mother?

薇拉 对 就是她
Wylla. That's it.

她一定不是个简单的姑娘
She must have been a rare wench

能让艾德・史塔克公爵忘却荣誉
to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.

你从来没告诉我她生什么样…？
You never told me what she looked like.

以后也不会
Nor will I.

当时我们在打仗
We were at war.

过的是朝不保夕的日子
None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.

妈的 你律己太严了 老是这德行
You're too hard on yourself. You always have been.

我发誓我要不是你国王 你刚才就要揍我了
I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.

你戴上王冠之后最操蛋的事
The worst thing about your coronation

就是我不能对你动手
I'll never get to hit you again.

相信我 这不是最操蛋的事
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

昨晚来了个信使
There was a rider in the night.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安刚嫁给一个多斯拉克马王
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.

那又如何？难不成我们该送份贺礼过去？
What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?

我看送把刀更好 一把锐利的好刀
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one,

拿在一个有胆量的人手里
and a bold man to wield it.

她不过是个孩子
She's little more than a child.

这个‘孩子’很快就会张开双腿 繁殖孽种了
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.

你暗示的是令人发指的事 噢 我令人发指？
Tell me we're not speaking of this. Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

她爹对你家人干的那些事 那才叫令人发指
What her father did to your familythat was unspeakable.

还有雷加・坦格利安对你妹妹…
What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister

对我心爱的女人干的那些事
the woman I loved.

我要亲手宰掉每一个坦格利安家的人
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

你没法亲手宰掉这一个 对吧？
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?

这个卓戈卡奥
This Khal Drogo,

据说他手下有十万大军
it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.

多斯拉克人远在狭海对岸
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm,

即便百万大军又有何惧？
as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.

劳勃 那些野蛮人没有船
They have no ships, Robert.

到现在王国里还有人叫我‘篡夺者’
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

倘若哪天那坦格利安臭小子带着多斯拉克大军渡海
If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back,

这批人渣一定会拥护他 他渡不了海
the scum will join him. He will not cross.

就算他真来了 我们也能协力把他赶回去
And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.

风雨欲来啊 奈德
There's a war coming, Ned.

我不知道何时爆发
I don't know when,

也不清楚我们的对手
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

但我闻到了战争的味道
but it's coming.

坐下
Sit.

给你们饭吃
You'll be fed.

暂时松开他们
Untie them.

强奸犯哪
Ah, rapers.

他们的选择…割卵蛋还是守长城
They were given a choice no doubtcastration or the wall.

多数人无疑还是舍不得那话儿
Most choose the knife.

对你的新兄弟们没啥好感？
Not impressed by your new brothers?

别忘了 做守夜人最妙的事
Lovely thing about the watch

就是可以抛弃旧家庭 换来一批新弟兄呐
you discard your old family and get a whole new one.

班扬・史塔克
临冬城公爵之弟 守夜人的首席游骑兵

你读那么多书干嘛？
Why do you read so much?

看着我 然后告诉我你看到了什么？
Look at me and tell me what you see.

你耍什么把戏？
Is this a trick?

你看到的是个侏儒
What you see is a dwarf.

如果我生在普通农家 早被扔进树林里等死
If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.

我偏又生在凯岩城的兰尼斯特家
Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

众人对我万般期待
Things are expected of me.

你瞧 我爹干了二十年的御前首相…
My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.

你哥哥却把国王杀了
Until your brother killed that King.

是的 我老哥把国王给宰了
Yes, until my brother killed him.

人生就是这样变幻无常
Life is full of these little ironies.

我老姐嫁给了新任国王
My sister married the new King

我那脾气暴躁的外甥则会继承王位
and my repulsive nephew will be King after him.

我空担着家族名誉 总得尽点心力罢？
I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree?

但是要怎么做呢？
But how?

呵 老哥有他的宝剑
Well, my brother has his sword

我则有我的脑袋瓜
and I have my mind.

脑袋需要多读书 好比宝剑需要磨刀石
And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.

琼恩・雪诺 这就是为什么我读个不停
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

你呢？
And you?

你的故事又是什么 私生子？
What's your story, bastard?

求我 或许我会讲给你听 侏儒
Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

一个一无所有的私生子小弟
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

怀着满腔热血
off to join

前去加入历史悠久的守夜人军团
the ancient order of The Night's Watch

途中结识了一帮英勇高尚的好兄弟…
alongside his Valiant brothersinarms.

守夜人是保护王国免遭…
The Night's Watch protects the realm from

啊 是的是的 免遭古灵精怪
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks

以及你奶妈告诉你的各种妖怪侵袭的惟一屏障
and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.

你是个聪明孩子
You're a smart boy.

怎会相信这种屁话？
You don't believe that nonsense.

喝饱一肚子酒 感觉就舒坦了
Everything's better with some wine in the belly.

鲁温
临冬城学士

夫人 我们该清点帐目了
It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.

这样您才知道这次招待王室的开销
You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.

这些事找普尔说去
Talk to Poole about it.

普尔随史塔克大人南下了 夫人
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.

我们需要一位新总管
We need a new steward,

还有好些职务需要我们立刻决…
and there are several other appointments that require

立刻决… 你觉得我在乎什么职务安排吗！
our immediate attentionI don't care about appointments!

我来安排
I'll make the appointments.

我们明早首先处理这事
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

好的 大人
Very good, my Lord.

夫人
My Lady.

您有多久没踏出这房间了？
When was the last time you left this room?

我得照顾他…
I have to take care of him.

母亲 他不会死的
He's not going to die, mother.

鲁温师傅说危险期已经过了
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.

要是他错了呢？
What if he's wrong?

布兰需要我 瑞肯需要您
Bran needs me. Rickon needs you.

他才六岁
He's six.

根本搞不清事态 所以成天跟着我
He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day,

抱着我大腿又哭又闹… 关上窗子罢！
clutching my leg, cryingclose the windows!

我受不了！他们别叫了！
I can't stand it! Please make them stop!

失火了
Fire.

您留在这 我很快就回来
You stay here. I'll come back.

你不该在这儿
You're not supposed to be here.

这里不该有人
No one is supposed to be here.

这是为他好 反正他跟死人没两样
It's a mercy. He's dead already.

不！
No!

你们见过龙吗？卡丽熙 龙已经绝迹啦
Have you ever seen a dragon? Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

到处都一样？连东方也是？
Everywhere? Even in the east?

没有龙了 勇士们把龙都杀光了
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

大家都知道 大家都知道
It is known. It is known.

姬琪
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

多莉亚
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

有个魁尔斯商人跟我说龙是从月亮里钻出来的
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.

从月亮来的？
The moon?

他告诉我月亮是颗蛋 卡丽熙
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,

天上原本有两个月亮
that once there were two moons in the sky.

但其中一个运行得太靠近太阳 受不住高热 就爆炸了
But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

成千上万只龙从中涌出
Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons

他们吸收了太阳的火焰
and they drank the sun's fire.

月亮才不是什么蛋
Moon is no egg.

月亮是女神 太阳的妻子
Moon is goddesswife of sun.

伊丽
丹妮莉丝・坦格利安的侍女

大家都知道 大家都知道
It is known. It is known.

她留下 你们退下吧
Leave me with her.

魁尔斯商人干嘛跟你说这些？
Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?

男人开心起来话就多呗
Men like to talk when they're happy.

你哥哥把我买下给你之前
Before your brother bought me for you,

我天天哄男人开心
it was my job to make men happy.

你干了几年？ 我九岁那年
How old were you? I was nine

就被母亲卖去妓院
when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.

九岁？！
Nine?!

最初的三年我并没有接客 卡丽熙
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.

首先
First

必须学会取悦他们的办法
you must learn.

你能教我如何取悦卡奥吗？
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?

当然可以 我也需要学上三年吗？
Yes. Will it take three years?

不用
No.

长城欢迎你
Welcome.

我告诉你们的事 绝不许外传
What I am about to tell you must remain between us.

我认为布兰绝非失足坠楼
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

而是被抛下去的
I think he was thrown.

罗德利克・凯索
临冬城教头

这孩子以前从没出过事
The boy was always surefooted before.

有人对他连下两次毒手
Someone tried to kill him twice.

这是为什么？为什么要残害一个无辜幼儿？
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

除非是他看见了不该看见的事
Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.

席恩・葛雷乔伊
临冬城公爵养子

看见了什么 夫人？ 我也不清楚
Saw what, my lady? I don't know.

但我敢以性命打赌 兰尼斯特家族脱不了干系
But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.

之前我们就有理由怀疑他们对王室的忠诚了
We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

您是否注意到刺客行凶用的匕首？
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

以他的地位不足以使用这么精良的武器
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

刀刃是瓦雷利亚钢打造 刀柄的材质是龙骨
The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.

一定是有人交给他的
Someone gave it to him.

他们来我家做客 竟敢图谋我弟弟？
They come into our home and try to murder my brother?

如果他们想要开战…
If it's war they want

倘若真有战事 我会与你并肩作战
If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.

怎么 你们要在神木林里宣战吗？
What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?

啊？
Huh?

成何体统 开战之事岂可妄言
Too easily words of war become acts of war.

况且我们尚未查明真相
We don't know the truth yet.

此事必须报告史塔克大人
Lord Stark must be told of this.

这种事我不放心乌鸦传信
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.

我去君临走一趟 不行
I'll ride to King's Landing. No.

无论如何 临冬城都要有史塔克家的人当家
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

我自己去 母亲 您不能走
I will go myself. Mother, you can't.

我必须去
I must.

我叫哈尔带一队守卫随您去
I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.

大队人马只会惹来不必要的注意
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

我不希望兰尼斯特家知道我南下的消息
I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.

起码让我跟您一道去
Let me accompany you at least.

国王大道对一个女人家来说太危险
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.

布兰怎么办？
What about Bran?

我已经为他向天上的七神祈祷了一个多月
I have prayed to the seven for more than a month.

他的性命就交给他们吧
Bran's life is in their hands now.

不 卡丽熙
No, Khaleesi.

您必须看着他的眼睛
You must look in his eyes always.

眼睛是心灵的窗户 爱的窗户
Love comes in at the eyes.

据说里斯的爱格娜仅凭那对明眸
It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man

就足以消化男人
with nothing but her eyes.

消化男人？
Finish a man?

君王们为她万里跋涉
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia.

总督们为她变卖华美宫殿
Magisters sold their palaces.

卡奥们为她屠城灭国…只为了换得片刻春宵销魂
Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.

据说有上千人向她求过婚
They say a thousand men proposed to her

她却一个也不要
and she refused them all.

好吧 听起来倒是个有趣的女人
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman.

我…我认为
II don't think

卓戈不会喜欢我在他上面
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

那您就该让他喜欢 卡丽熙
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

男人都爱尝鲜
Men want what they've never had.

多斯拉克人像公狗骑母狗那样骑他们的奴隶
And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.

您是奴隶吗 卡丽熙？
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

那就别像奴隶一样交欢
Then don't make love like a slave.

这样才好 卡丽熙
Very good, Khaleesi.

在帐篷外 他是高高在上的卡奥
Out there he is the mighty Khal,

但在帐篷里 您才是他的主宰
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

我…我认为
II don't think

这不是多斯拉克人的方式
that this is the Dothraki way.

如果他只想遵循多斯拉克人的方式
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

又何必娶你呢？
why did he marry you?

卓戈 卡奥 
多斯拉克部族首领

不
No.

不！
No!

今晚我要看着你的脸
Tonight I would look upon your face.

珊莎・史塔克
临冬城公爵长女

对不起 爵士先生
Pardon me, Ser.

伊林・派恩


我有这么可怕么 小妹妹？
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

还是他让你发抖？
Or is it him there making you shake?

我也怕他
He frightens me too.

看着那张脸
Look at that face.

如果冒犯了您 我道歉 爵士先生
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.

为何他不愿跟我说话？
Why won't he speak to me?

“疯王”叫人用烧红的钳子把他舌头给拔了
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.

他这二十年来都不爱讲话
Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.

如今他改用剑说话
He speaks damn well with his sword though.

他就是伊林・派恩爵士 御前执法官
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.

王家刽子手
The royal executioner.

亲爱的小姐 你怎么了？
What is it, sweet lady?

是不是因为这只狗？
Does the hound frighten you?

滚远点罢
Away with you, dog.

你吓到我的小姐了
You're scaring my lady.

我要你高高兴兴地
I don't like to see you upset.

今天终于放晴了
The Sun is finally shining.

陪我出去玩吧
Come walk with me.

乖乖待在这儿 淑女
Stay, lady.

或许我不该再喝了
I probably shouldn't have any more.

父亲大人只准我们在宴会上喝一杯
Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.

我的公主爱喝多少就喝多少
My princess can drink as much as she wants.

别担心…有我在你不用怕
Don't worryyou're safe with me.

别跑！
I'll get you!

艾莉亚！ 哎哟！
Arya! Ow!

你们来这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

走开 你妹妹？
Go away. Your sister?

小子 你又是谁？米凯 大人
And who are you, boy? Mycah, my Lord.

他是屠夫的学徒 他是我朋友
He the butcher's boy. He's my friend.

杀猪的也想当骑士 是吗？
A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh?

屠夫小弟 把剑捡起来 咱们来瞧瞧你够不够格
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.

是她逼我的 大人 是她逼我这么做的
She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.

我是你的王子殿下
I'm your prince,

不是什么大人
not your lord,

我命令你把剑捡起来
and I said pick up your sword.

米凯
屠夫的学徒

殿下 这不是剑 只是根棍子罢了
It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.

正如你也不过是个杀猪的
And you're not a Knight.

根本不是骑士
Only a butcher's boy.

你打的是我这位小姐的妹妹 你知不知道
That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?

住手！ 艾莉亚 你别插手！
Stop it! Arya, stay out of this.

我不会把他伤得…
I won't hurt him...

太厉害
Much.

艾莉亚！
Arya!

肮脏的小婊子！
Filthy little bitch!

住手 住手 不要打了！你们两个都住手！
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you.

你们把事情搞砸了 都搞砸了！
You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!

我劈死你 不要脸的烂货！
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

艾莉亚！ 娜梅莉亚！
Arya! Nymeria!

艾莉亚！ 娜梅莉亚！
Arya! Nymeria!

不要
No.

不要伤害我
No. Please don't.

艾莉亚 你别欺负他！
Arya, leave him alone.

我的王子 我可怜的王子 看看她们做了什么好事
My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.

躺着别动 我这就回旅店 找人来帮忙
Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.

那就滚罢！
Then go!

还有 不准碰我
Don't touch me.

那只狼不在这儿 去溪边找找
The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.

你走罢 他们会为了乔佛里的事杀你的
You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.

快走罢…走啊！
Go onrun.

走啊！求求你 赶紧走啊！
Go! Leave now!

那可是只冰原狼 我去下面搜
It's a direwolf. I'll check down here.

我听到什么动静
I think I heard a noise.

现在就走！
Go!

艾莉亚！
Arya!

艾莉亚！ 艾莉亚！
Arya! Arya!

艾莉亚！
Aryaaa!

艾莉亚！
Arya!

艾莉亚！
Arya!

陛下！
My lord!

陛下！找到她了
My lord! They found her.

小姐没有受伤
She's unharmed.

她在哪儿？
Where is she?

她被直接带到国王那里去了
She's been taken directly before the King.

乔里・凯索
史塔克家族的侍卫队长

谁带她去的？ 兰尼斯特家的人
Who took her? The Lannisters found her.

艾莉亚！ 好 我们赶紧回去
Aryaaa! Right, get back.

王后的命令是将她直接带到国王面前
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.

回去！回旅店
Back! Back to the inn.

都回去！
All back!

对不起 对不起 对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

你有没有受伤？ 没有
Are you hurt? No.

噢 没事了
Oh, it's all right.

你这是什么意思？
What is the meaning of this?

找到我女儿为什么不第一时间通知我？
Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?

你竟敢用这种口气对国王说话！
How dare you speak to your King in that manner?

女人 你给我闭嘴
Quiet, woman.

奈德 不好意思 我没有吓她的意思
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

但这桩事早点了结比较好
But we need to get this business done quickly.

你这野丫头和那杀猪的联手攻击我儿子
Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.

她那只野狼差点就咬断他一条胳膊
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

才不是这样！
That's not true!

她只…只咬了他一下下
She just... Bit him a little.

而且是因为他先欺负米凯 小乔把事情经过都告诉我们了
He was hurting Mycah. Joff told us what happened.

你和那学徒一边用棍子打他
You and that boy beat him with clubs

一边放狼咬他 事情不是这样的！
while you set your wolf on him. That's not what happened!

明明就是这样！
Yes it is!

他们一起围攻我 她还把我的剑丢进河里
They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.

你说谎！ 你住嘴！
Liar! Shut up!

够了！
Enough!

他说的是一回事 她说的却完全是另一回事
He tells me one thing, she tells me another.

七层地狱！你叫我怎么办？
Seven hells! What am I to make of this?

你的大女儿在哪儿 奈德？
Where's your other daughter, Ned?

她已经睡了
In bed asleep.

不 她没有睡
She's not.

珊莎 请上前来 亲爱的
Sansa, come here, darling.

现在 孩子…
Now, child...

告诉我们究竟是怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

原原本本地说 老老实实地讲
Tell it all and tell it true.

欺骗国王可是滔天大罪
It's a great crime to lie to a King.

我不知道
I don't know.

我不记得了 事情发生得好快
I don't remember. Everything happened so fast.

我没看见… 骗子！
I didn't see. Liar!

骗子！骗子！ 艾莉亚！
Liar liar liar! Arya!

嘿！快住手！够了！ 骗子！骗子！
Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. Liar liar liar!

艾莉亚！住手！ 这丫头跟她那只脏东西一个野德行
Stop! Arya! She's as wild as that animal of hers.

她非受罚不可
I want her punished.

你要我怎么办？打她几鞭游街示众吗？
What would you have me do, whip her through the streets?

该死 不过就是小孩打架 现在没事了
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

乔佛里手上一辈子都会留着疤痕
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.

一个小丫头就把你缴了械？
You let that little girl disarm you?

奈德 好好管教你女儿
Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined.

我也会好好管教我儿子 国王陛下 我乐意之至
I'll do the same with my son. Gladly, your Grace.

那只冰原狼又该怎么办？
And what of the direwolf?

那只欺辱你儿子的禽兽该如何处置？
What of the beast that savaged your son?

我倒是把那头该死的狼给忘了
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

陛下 那只狼一点影子都没有
We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.

找不到？那就算了
No? So be it.

我们还有一只狼
We have another wolf.

随你便吧
As you will.

你不是说真的吧？ 冰原狼不是宠物
You can't mean it. A direwolf's no pet.

帮她弄条狗 她会快乐点
Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.

他不是说淑女吧 是不是？
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

不 不！不要碰淑女！淑女不咬人的！
No no, not lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!

她最乖… 淑女根本不在场！
She's good! Lady wasn't there!

你们不要欺负她！ 叫他们住手 不是这样的
You leave her alone! Stop them. Don't let them do it.

求求你 求求你…咬人的不是淑女！
Please please, it wasn't Lady!

这是你的旨意吗…
Is this your command

陛下？
your Grace?

那只野兽在哪里？ 被拴在门外 陛下
Where is the beast? Chained up outside, your Grace.

伊林爵士 请你替…
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

不
No.

乔里…
Jory...

带女孩们回房去
Take the girls to their rooms.

假如她非死不可
If it must be done,

我要亲自动手
then I'll do it myself.

想耍什么把戏？
Is this some trick?

她来自北方
The wolf is of the north.

死也不能死在屠夫手里
She deserves better than a butcher.

这是那个屠夫学徒…
The butcher's boy

你骑马追杀他？
you rode him down?

他爱跑…
He ran...

可惜跑得不够快
Not very fast.
