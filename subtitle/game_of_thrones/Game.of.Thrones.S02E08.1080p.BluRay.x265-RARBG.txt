第二季第八集  The Prince of Winterfell
北国僭主

席恩・葛雷乔伊
临冬城王子

“裂颚”达格摩
铁民

骑兵进城！ 打开城门！
Rider approaching! Open the gate!

亚拉・葛雷乔伊
席恩之姐

看哪 临冬城亲王登场喽
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

好个吃飞醋的女人，吃什么？
Envy isn't attractive. What envy?

你该为你弟弟的胜利感到骄傲
You should be proud of your brother's achievement.

只用二十个人 我便拿下了临冬城
I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.

好个伟大的战士
You're a great warrior.

我瞧见你挂在城门上的尸体了
I saw the bodies above your gates.

不知道哪个更难料理些
Which one gave you the tougher fight,

跛子呢 还是六岁小孩？
the cripple or the sixyearold?

我以荣誉之道对待史塔克的小崽子
I treated the Stark boys with honor

但他们用背叛作为回报
and they repaid me with treachery.

你所谓的荣誉之道就是屠戮他们？
You treated them with honor by butchering them?

杀他们之前 我对他们
Before I had to kill them, I treated them

占据他们的家 这是你的权利
you seized their home, as is your right.

我们是铁种 强取一切想要的，正是
We're Ironborn; We take what we need. Exactly.

你将他们囚禁在他们自己家里 结果他们溜了
Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.

这也能叫背叛？
Is that treachery?

我看这叫勇敢
I'd call it bravery.

他们承诺过
They made me a promise

你的小囚犯们给了你承诺
Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

他们不照办 你就失心疯了？
and you got mad when they broke it?

哪个婊子像你这么愁人的？
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

别叫我，婊子
Don't call me aA cunt.

愁死人的蠢婊子杀了临冬城里仅有的两个史塔克
A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.

你难道不知道这两个孩子的价值吗？
You know how valuable those boys were?

如果我不杀他们 全北境都会把我看成懦夫
If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.

你就是懦夫 外加蠢材
You are weak. And you're stupid.

我警告你
I'm warning you.

接着说啊
Go on, then,

警告我啊
warn me.

你带来的人太少了
You haven't brought enough men.

就这么点人 你要我怎么守城？
How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?

没人要你守城 我是来带你回家的
You're not. I've come to bring you home.

父亲想和你谈谈，你在开玩笑？
Father wants a word. Is this a joke?

临冬城是北境的心脏
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

啊 是啊 离大海有几百里呢
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

宝贝小弟 我们是铁民
We're islanders, baby brother.

你是不是忘得一干二净了？
Had you forgotten that?

我们的力量源自我们的长船
Our power comes from our ships.

何况你用史塔克男孩的尸体
And now that you've decorated your walls

装饰你的城墙
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

是个北方佬都想看着你被吊死
every man in the North wants to see you hanged.

如果罗柏・史塔克知道
When Robb Stark finds out

他不会知道 我们杀光了乌鸦
He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens.

马也都在我们手上
We have all the horses.

我拿下了临冬城
I've taken Winterfell.

我就要守住临冬城
And I will keep Winterfell.

都下去
Leave us.

席恩 我们是血亲骨肉
Theon, you're my blood.

有着同一位敬爱的母亲
We both loved our mother.

同一位严苛的父亲
We both endured our father.

和我回家吧 别独自客死他乡
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

我没打算要死
I don't intend to die.

你知道吗 你从婴儿起就很讨厌
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

哭个不停 从不睡觉
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

有天晚上 你怎么也不肯闭嘴
And one night you just wouldn't shut up,

叫得像只快死的猪
screaming like a dying pig.

我走到你的摇篮边 看着你
I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.

我想掐死你
I wanted to strangle you.

而你突然停止哭叫 抬头看着我
And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.

对着我笑
You smiled at me.

不要死在离大海这么远的地方
Don't die so far from the sea.

叮当衫
野人 “骸骨之王”

骸骨之王 我给您带礼物来了
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

琼恩・雪诺
守夜人

耶哥蕊特
 野人 “火吻而生”

乌鸦我有了 不需要两只
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

曼斯会想审问这一只的
Mance will want to question this one.

他知道其余乌鸦的藏身处和计划
Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.

科林
 守夜人游骑兵 “断掌”

断掌知道的更多 这只不过是小孩
The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy.

宰了他
Gut him.

他本可以杀我十几次
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

现在他肯定后悔了 宰了他
And now he wishes he did. Gut him.

他是临冬城奈德・史塔克的杂种崽子
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

曼斯会要他的
Mance will want him.

曼斯要死人的杂种做什么？
What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?

我不知道
I don't know.

我想他会要亲自裁决
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

他敢跑 我就割了他的蛋
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

他敢跑 我亲自下手
He runs, I'll do it meself.

我们扯平了 琼恩・雪诺
We're even now, Jon Snow.

我下不了手
I couldn't do it.

我都把剑架到她脖子上了 我就是不能
I had the sword at her neck, I just couldn't

我知道，其他人呢？
I know. The others?

你没能返回 我们就去找你
When you didn't come back, we went looking for you.

找到你的踪迹花不了多久
We found your tracks fast enough.

但在找到你之前 他们发现了我们
But they found us before we found you.

他们因我而死
They died because of me.

不能让他们白白牺牲
See that it wasn't for nothing.

好了 起来 伙计们
All right, up, lad.

站起来 快
Come on, on your feet, now.

走
Move it.

她美吗？
Is she beautiful?

我从未见过她
I've never met her.

她的芳名是？
What's her name?

姓佛雷 我想是吧
Frey, I suppose.

我不知道她的名字
I don't know her first name.

泰丽莎
瓦兰提斯女护士

罗柏・史塔克
北境之王

我敢肯定 您会很幸福的
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

您是为了过一座桥娶的她吗？
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

那桥很关键，噢
An important bridge. Ah.

那时他们还没杀害我的父亲
It was before they killed my father.

我还以为只要过了桥
I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time,

就能及时南下救他脱困
but only if I crossed that bridge.

我会和北境人聊到您的父亲
When I speak to people from the North,

他们都爱戴他
they all loved your father.

他是我见过最优秀的人
He was the best man I ever met.

我知道 小孩们都会那样仰慕他们的父亲 但
I know children always think that about their fathers, but

不是所有的孩子都这么想
Children do not always think that about their fathers,

请相信我
believe me.

他曾教导我 做一方领主就像做一个父亲
He once told me that being a Lord is like being a father,

区别在于领主的孩子要更多
except you have thousands of children

上千个孩子 个个都需要关心
and you worry about all of them.

犁地的农民 待你守护
The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect.

擦地的女佣 待你守护
The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect.

更别说跟随你出生入死的士兵
The soldiers you order into battle.

他告诉我 每日他于恐惧中醒来
He told me he woke with fear in the morning

于恐惧中睡去
and went to bed with fear in the night.

我不相信
I didn't believe him.

于是问他
I asked him,

“人在恐惧的时候还能勇敢吗？”
"how can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

他告诉我 “人唯有恐惧的时候方能勇敢”
"That is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.

真希望我可以见见他
I wish I could have met him.

他会喜欢你的
He would have liked you.

比起擦地女佣 大多数老爷们
Most Lords worry more about their gold

更关心金子和荣誉
and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

他不关心金子和荣誉
He didn't care much about gold or glory.

那您呢？
And you?

你认为我是为了被传唱光辉事迹而打仗？
You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me?

我只想回家
I want to go home.

我只想让追随我的人回家
I want the men following me to go home.

那为什么您不这么做呢？
Then why don't you?

因为除非兰尼斯特被打败 否则我们将不得太平
Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.

而且我遵循正义
And because I believe in justice.

您是指 砍了乔佛里的头？
Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.

那会是正义的开始
That would be a start.

陛下 小姐
Your Grace, Milady.

弑君者夜里逃走了
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

怎么跑的？
How?

怎么跑的？！
How?!

别告诉我这是真的
Tell me this isn't true.

凯特琳・徒利
史塔克夫人

为什么？
Why?

为了你妹妹们，你背叛我
For the girls. You betrayed me.

罗柏，别说了！
RobbNo!

瑞卡德・卡史塔克
卡霍城伯爵

你知道我绝不允许
You knew I would not allow it

但你还是做了
and you did it anyway.

布兰和瑞肯被囚禁在临冬城
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.

珊莎和艾莉亚被囚禁在君临
Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.

我有五个孩子 如今只有一个是自由之身
I have five children, and only one of them is free.

我的一个儿子战死在您儿子身边
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

另一个死在弑君者手下
I lost another to the Kingslayer,

被锁链勒死
strangled with a chain.

您犯这叛国之罪
You commit treason

就因为您的孩子做了囚徒？
because your children are prisoners?

如果天父能从坟墓里唤醒我的儿子
I would carve out my heart

仅让他们进牢房做人质
and offer it to the father if he would let my sons

我宁愿挖出我心作为交换
wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.

大人 我为你的儿子哀悼
I grieve for your sons, My Lord.

我不要您的哀悼 我只要复仇
I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance.

您剥夺了我复仇的权利
And you stole it from me.

就算杀了詹姆・兰尼斯特
Killing Jaime Lannister

也不能换得你儿子死而复生
would not buy life for your children,

但把他送还君临
but returning him to King's Landing

却能保我女儿平安归来
may buy life for mine.

詹姆・兰尼斯特耍了你
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

你让我军陷入弱势
You've weakened our position.

惹得满营非议 扰乱了军心
You've brought discord into our camp.

这一切还都是你背着我干的
And you did it all behind my back.

确保她日夜有人看守
Make sure she's guarded day and night.

罗柏
Robb.

我们派了多少人追捕弑君者？
How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

回陛下 四十人
40, Your Grace.

再派四十人 给他们最快的马
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

罗柏
Robb.

啊 噢！
Whoa, oof!

塔斯的布蕾妮
凯特琳的护卫

该死
Damn.

詹姆・兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 “弑君者”

太阳底下看你更丑了
You're much uglier in daylight.

你叫什么？
What's your name?

我乃凯岩城的詹姆・兰尼斯特
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,

泰温之子
son of Tywin.

被俘虏的骑士总有权利知道俘虏他的是谁吧
A captive Knight has a right to know his captor's identity.

塔斯的布蕾妮
Brienne of Tarth.

塔斯 塔斯 塔斯
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

新月和星芒
Crescent moons and starbursts.

领主是…塞尔温・塔斯
Lord... Selwyn Tarth,

你的父亲
your father.

小姐 你可有兄弟姐妹？
Do you have any brothers and sisters, My Lady?

君临远的很
It's a long way to King's Landing.

路上不妨互相熟悉一下吧
Might as well get to know one another.

你跟很多男人打过交道么？
Have you known many men?

我看不像
I suppose not.

女人？
Women?

马？啊！
Horses? Ah!

我无意冒犯 小姐
I didn't mean to give offense, My Lady.

原谅我
Forgive me.

你的罪恶不可原谅 弑君者
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

你为什么这么憎恨我？
Why do you hate me so much?

我伤害过你？ 你伤害过别人
Have I ever harmed you?，You've harmed others

那些你誓言守护的人
those you were sworn to protect,

弱者 无辜之人
the weak, the innocent.

有人告诉过你 你的无趣堪比你的丑陋吗？
Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?

想激怒我 你不会得逞的
You will not provoke me to anger.

我已经得逞了 瞧瞧你自己
I already have. Look at you.

你已经准备切下我的脑袋了
You're ready to chop my head off.

你觉的你能行吗？
Do you think you could?

你觉得你能在公正的决斗中击败我吗？
Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?

我还没见过你战斗
I've never seen you fight.

答案是不行
The answer is no.

七国上下最多三个
There are three men in the kingdoms who might

或许可与我一较高下
have a chance against me.

你不是他们其中之一
You're not one of them.

我一辈子都在听你这样的男人对我嗤之以鼻
All my life men like you have sneered at me.

我一辈子都在把你这样的男人揍成狗啃泥
And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.

若你如此自信 何不解开我的枷锁
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.

见个分晓
Let's see what happens.

你当我是白痴？上船
Do you take me for an idiot? In.

我当你是战士
I took you for a fighter,

一个有荣誉的汉子 抱歉 是婆娘
a manpardonwoman of honor.

我错了吗？
Was I wrong?

你在害怕
You're afraid.

也许改天我们能比个高低 弑君者
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

史坦尼斯一旦率军登陆
King's Landing will fall an hour

一个小时内君临就会陷落
after Stannis lands his force.

乔佛里国王和瑟曦 还有其他宫廷成员
It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei

“阿利”
艾莉亚・史塔克 泰温的侍酒

还够时间向西撤退到安全区域
and the court to ride west to safety.

拱手让出铁王座？
Surrender the Iron Throne?

泰温・兰尼斯特
凯岩城公爵 西境守护

总比看见他们的脑袋插在城门的枪尖上强
Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.

凯冯・兰尼斯特
泰温公爵之弟

史坦尼斯会将他们统统斩首
Stannis will execute them all.

不行 逃跑的国王很快就不再是国王
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.

他是一个兰尼斯特 他必须昂首迎战
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

史坦尼斯 距离王都仅剩两日路程
Stannis, two days from the capital

而狼崽子还呆在我家门口
and the wolf at my doorstep.

烙印城
西境城堡 马尔布兰家族领地

探子向我们保证 罗柏・史塔克还驻军在烙印城以北
The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.

哼 上次探子也这么保证
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us

结果我们掉进了史塔克的陷阱
of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap.

我儿子这才成了他的俘虏
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

那距离凯岩城太近了
Too close to Casterly Rock.

他分出一部分兵力
He sent a splinter force

打算夺回临冬城
to recapture Winterfell.

葛雷乔伊帮了我们很大的忙
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.

在聚齐全部兵力之前
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock

史塔克不会冒险进军凯岩城
until he's at full force.

他还是个从未打过败仗的小子
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

什么险他都会冒的
He'll risk anything at any time

格雷果・克里冈
“魔山”

因为他根本不知道害怕
because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

傍晚时分我们就出发
We'll ride at nightfall.

我希望在他察觉之前 我们已经行军一整晚
I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move.

克里冈 你继续留守赫伦堡
Clegane, you'll maintain a Garrison here at Harrenhal.

搜捕兄弟会 彻底剿灭他们
Track down this brotherhood and destroy them.

这个小女孩是个不错的仆人
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

她将留在你身边
She'll stay on with you.

确保他晚上不要喝得烂醉
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.

他没喝醉的时候脾气很差
He's poor company when he's sober,

但是干起活来要有效得多
but he's better at his work.

老实回答问题
You've got some questions to answer.

谁杀了亚摩利爵士？
Who killed Ser Amory?

我不知道！ 快说是谁！
I don't know! Give me the name!

求你了！ 把他扔出去喂乌鸦
Please! Take this one out for the crows.

我说了 我不知道
I told you, I don't know.

求求你了
Please.

看呐 尤伦的小骚货
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

原来是个小子 现在变成了娘们
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

贾昆在哪呢？
Where's Jaqen?

关我屁事
Don't care.

你那根棍子呢 贱人？
Where's your stick now, bitch?

记得我说过要拿它活活干死你
I promised to fuck you with it.

都过来 该去杀些狼崽子了
Come on, time to kill some wolves.

要做得好吃你得需要一些酸樱桃
You need sour cherries to make it right.

“热派”

诀窍在于要把樱桃核晒干
And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you

詹德利
“大牛”

然后用木棒敲碎
break them with a mallet.

樱桃真正的味道就在这
That's where the real flavor is.

你得把它们磨的很碎
You crush 'em up real fine.

然后均匀的洒在馅饼皮上
And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

贾昆在哪里？ 我怎么知道？
Where's Jaqen? How would I know?

我现在找他有事
I need him now.

泰温公爵今晚就要出兵了
Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

那要贾昆干吗？ 他在帮我
You need him? He's helping me.

我看见他了，在哪？
I saw him. Where?

在哪？！ 啊哦！
Where?! Ow!

他在哪？
Where?

几个小时之前他们骑马出城了
They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.

去巡逻了 放开我的耳朵
On patrol. Let go of my ears.

你找他到底要干嘛？
What do you want with him anyway?

曼斯打算进攻长城
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

若真是这样 一个兄弟做卧底
When he does, one brother inside his army

顶的上一千个兄弟和他硬拼
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

他们绝不会信任我的，他们或许会的…
They'll never trust me. They might...

只要你做了该做的事情，什么？
If you do what needs to be done. What?

知道自己的兄弟们都死了你满意了？
How does it feel knowing those men all died

就为了你跟这个女野人在雪地里胡搞
so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?

我没有
I didn't.

我早该知道的 不能相信你这个叛国者的杂种
I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.

他可由不得你来杀 乌鸦
He's not yours to kill, crow.

提利昂・兰尼斯特
 代理首相 “小恶魔”

你非得在这刮指甲？
Do you have to do that here?

波隆
都城守备队队长

我喜欢保持双手干净
I like to keep me hands clean.

不错 但是非得在这弄吗？
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

你应该穿上你的金袍子
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

我不想穿那身金袍子
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

你是都城守备队的司令
You're commander of the City Watch.

你不应该再穿得像个普通佣兵
You shouldn't be dressed like a common sellsword.

战斗中那身斗篷会拖累我
A cloak slows you down in a fight,

很难再悄悄地接近敌人了
makes it hard to move quietly.

还有金色会反射阳光
And the gold catches the light,

看起来很好看 但是晚上会更容易被认出来
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

你已经不需要再偷偷溜进巷子里了
Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer.

你应该正大光明的站出来
You're supposed to stand out.

我们有过协议 穿那身金袍子可不在其中
We had a deal, and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

好吧 好吧
Fine, fine.

那就不穿
No gold cloak.

你干嘛？ 能干嘛？
What? What?

干嘛？干嘛？你干嘛一直盯着我？
What? What? Why are you staring at me?

你又不让我清理手指甲
You don't want me cleaning me nails.

还不让我看着你
You don't want me looking your way.

那叫我来干嘛？
Why am I here?

来帮我计划君临的防御措施
To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.

史坦尼斯的军队随时都可能出现
Stannis will be here any day.

这些书里写着怎么打败他？
And one of these explains how to beat him?

我宁肯拿你这些书换几个好弓箭手
I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.

瓦里斯

首相大人 司令大人
My Lord Hand, Commander.

我得向您表示敬意
I must compliment you

金袍子最近几个星期的效率有目共睹
on the Gold Cloaks' performance these last few weeks.

您知道吗 现在盗窃率有显著的下降
Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?

这我还不知道
I did not know.

你是怎么做到的？
And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?

我带着手下把所有已知的小偷控制了起来
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.

以便审问？
For questioning?

啊 不是
Uh, no.

现在我们只需要担心那些还未被控制的小偷了
It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.

我们谈过这事，是啊 我们谈过的
We talked about this. Aye, we talked about it.

你见过被包围的城市会变成什么样吗？
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

你那些书里大概没有这个
Maybe this part's not in your books.

要知道 大多数人并非死于战斗
See, it's not the fighting that kills most people.

而是死于饥饿 食物会比黄金更贵
It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold.

贵妇们会拿着她们的钻石换一袋土豆
Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.

战事拖得太久的话
Things get bad enough,

穷人们就该吃人肉了
the poor start eating each other.

而小偷们 他们喜欢围城
The thieves, they love a siege.

一旦城门被封锁 他们就开始偷走所有食物
Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food.

等战争结束之后 他们就是城里最富有的人
By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.

鉴于这种情况 大人
Given the circumstances, My Lord,

我想应该授权守备队采取一些极端措施
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

哦
Ah.

《维斯特洛重大围城战史》
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

Thrilling subject.

可惜大学士谢瓦尔森不是个好作者

史坦尼斯了解君临
Stannis knows King's Landing.

他知道哪里的城墙最坚固
He knows where the walls are strongest

他也知道哪里最容易攻破
and he knows which gates are weakest.

烂泥门
The mud gate.

攻城锤几分钟内就能攻破
A good ram will batter it down in minutes

而且离黑水河只有五十码
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

他一定会在这里登陆
That's where he'll land.

如果史坦尼斯真的进攻烂泥门
And if Stannis does attack the mud gate,

我们有何计划？
what is our plan?

我们可以拿书扔他们
We could throw books at his men.

我们没有那么多书
We don't have that many books.

也没有那么多人手
We don't have that many men, either.

我们有什么呢？

你想象力太差了
You lack imagination.

你觉得琼恩现在在哪？
Where do you think Jon is right now?

他跟断掌出去侦查 现在还没回来
He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back.

如果打赌的话我会押他已经死了
A betting man would go with dead.

他才没死
He's not dead.

不会的 琼恩是个优秀的战士
No, Jon's a great fighter.

确实 他是比我强
Well, he's better than me

也比你强得多
and a lot better than you.

他有一把瓦雷利亚钢剑
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

他父亲也有一把
So did his father.

断掌科林也是活着的最伟大的游骑兵
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.

问题是伟大的游骑兵不会活到老死
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

垃圾游骑兵也不会
Shit ones neither.

只有平庸的人才会活得久
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

哦 这一定是龙晶
Oh, must be Dragonglass.

龙晶？
Dragonglass?

学士们把这个叫做黑曜石
The Maesters call it Obsidian.

为什么会有兄弟把它们埋在这里
Why would a brother hide it here?

我想大概是他希望别人能找到它
I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.

走路长点眼
Mind where you're going.

对不起 我
I'm sorry. I'll

某人只保证杀人 女孩可以有其他人选
Only death. There must be others.

某人要名字 任谁都可以
Give a name, any name.

然后你就会杀了他们？
And you'll kill them?

任何人？
Anybody?

奉新生七神及诸多远古神祗之名
By the seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting,

吾立此誓
I swear it.

那就好
All right.

贾昆・赫加尔
Jaqen H'ghar.

女孩给的是某人的名字？
A girl gives a man his own name?

没错，诸神不可轻慢
That's right. Gods are not mocked.

女孩莫玩笑，我没开玩笑
This is no joking thing. I'm not joking.

某人自杀吧
A man can go kill himself.

换个名字，不

现在又要我的长子去战场送死

他有御林铁卫保护

他还有最好的盔甲护身

他必须得上战场

instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

有甜点么？
Any dessert?

你知道瓦里斯为何这么危险？
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

因为他拥有上千眼线？
Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.

因为他能预知我们的行动？
Because he knows everything we do before we do it.

因为他没那话儿
Because he doesn't have a cock.

但你呢
You, on the other hand,

跟其他男人一样 大傻瓜一个

思考
does half your thinking.

因为我高兴
Because I'm happy.

什么事儿让你这么高兴？
And why are you happy?

因为我搞到了你的小妓女
Because I have your little whore.

我还以为你只喜欢金头发的呢
I thought you preferred blondes.

你真是个小丑
Such a droll little fellow.

告诉我 你有没有跟这一位结婚啊？
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

没有？
No?

太好了 那父亲可就放心了
Oh, good. Father will be so pleased.

你管我操谁呢？

兰尼斯特有债必还
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

你偷走了我仅有的女儿

Where did you find her?

瓦里斯可不是唯一一个拥有情报网的人
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.

你竟然把我们的狮子项链也给她？
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

你可得把你的婊子藏的更仔细才好
You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.

你显然忘了婊子们的特点

非常喜欢

甚至是爱？
Could it be love?

别担心 她会受到优待的
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough...

除非 乔佛里受伤
unless Joffrey is hurt.

那么他所遭受的一切都会在她身上重演
And then every wound he suffers she'll suffer, too.

若他死了
And if he dies,

那你的小婊子会死得很痛苦
there isn't a man alive who could devise

超出任何人的想象
a more painful death for your little cunt.

在这事儿完结之前 也许我还真需要这么做

你属于我

我属于你
I'm yours.

对我发誓
Promise me.

我属于你 而你也属于我
I'm yours, and you are mine.

卢斯・波顿
恐怖堡伯爵

一旦他攻下城堡，我弟弟还在席恩手里

如果我们强攻城堡，他不敢伤害王子们

这可是他能活着逃离北境的唯一筹码
They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.

告诉你儿子
Send word to your son.

只要铁民投降
Any Ironborn who surrender

他们就可以平安归家
will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

一点慈悲确实是美德 陛下 但是太多的话就
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much

席恩・葛雷乔伊得不到我的慈悲
Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.

他背叛了我们的事业
He betrayed our cause.

他背叛了我
He betrayed me.

无论逃到何处 我们都将找到他
And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.

我倒是希望他的同胞知道条件后
I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute

会立刻背叛他
they hear the offer.

打扰了 大人 陛下
Your pardon, My Lord. Your Grace.

The Lannisters have my sisters.

我以为最要好的朋友

强占了我的家园 抓住了我弟弟们
has seized my home and my brothers.

战争还在继续 向南还是向北 进退两难
I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.

真抱歉 我的问题太蠢了
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question.

对不起，不
I'm sorry. No.

原谅我
Forgive me.

你出于好意 我不该
You're being kind. I have no right.

你拥有所有权力
You have every right.

你是国王
You're a king.

我并不想做这样的国王
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

您想做哪样的国王？
What kind do you want to be?

我不知道 好的那种吧
I don't know. The good kind.

大部分国王都是从王子长成的
Most kings grew up as princes.

他们一生都在为继承王位做准备
They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.

而我 只是被教导如何成为临冬城公爵
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

我只被教导如何成为一个淑女
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

一位会演奏竖琴 会跳最新潮的舞蹈
to play the harp and dance the latest steps

会背诵瓦雷利亚古诗的淑女
and recite Valyrian poetry.

我想听你演奏竖琴
I'd like to hear you play the harp.

不 不 你听不下去的
No. No, you would not.

你是怎么从背诵瓦雷利亚古诗
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

换成给人锯腿么？
to sawing off men's feet?

我十二岁时
When I was 12,

我父母去参加一个婚礼
my mother and father went to a wedding.

你要知道 在瓦兰提斯 婚礼通常能持续好几天
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

他们把我和弟弟留在家里
And they left me with my little brother.

他们走后的第二天
The second afternoon they were gone

是三年的长夏里最热的一天
was the hottest day in the threeyear summer.

我们在屋里热得受不了 就跑去洛恩河消暑
We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

洛恩河
东方大陆的一条河流

那天 瓦兰提斯所有的孩子都在洛恩河玩耍
Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.

富人 穷人 我们都聚集在一起
The rich, the poor, we were all there,

大家都赤裸着 大笑着 竞相往小岛游去
naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

鼓手们在东岸击鼓助威
Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.

当时我踩着水
I was treading water,

和朋友聊天
talking to a friend

突然我发现弟弟不见了
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

我呼唤他的名字
I called his name.

接着呼唤变为了哭喊
Then I started screaming his name.

终于 我看到他了
And then I saw him

面朝下 浮在水面
floating facedown.

我的心跳… 瞬间停止了
My heart just... stopped.

我那时…
I was...

我把他拽上来
I dragged him from the water.

也许我朋友也帮我了吧
My friend helped me, I think.

我都记不清了
I don't even remember.

他好小
He was so little.

我们把他拖到河岸上
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank...

对着他哭喊
and I screamed at him

摇他的肩膀
and I shook him

可是他死了
and he was dead.

就是死了
Just dead.

一个男人跑来了
A man ran over.

他脸上有鱼形的纹身
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

在瓦兰提斯 只有奴隶才有纹身
In Volantis the slaves have tattoos

这样就算不问 你也能清楚他们的身份
so you know what they are without having to talk to them.

这个人就是为一艘渔船服务的
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

他一把将我推开
And he pushed me out of the way.

你得明白
You have to understand,

若是一个奴隶敢推开贵族女孩
for a slave to push a highborn girl

就意味着死亡 可怕的死亡
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

但是他将我推开
But he pushed me out of the way

然后开始按压弟弟的胸膛
and he started pressing on my brother's chest

一而再 再而三
again and again and again

直到我弟弟把半条洛恩河
until my brother spat out

都吐了出来
half of the Rhoyne

直到他能哭喊出声
and cried out.

那个男人摸着他的头安慰着他
And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.

那天 我做了两个决定
I decided two things that day.

我不会再把自己的青春
I would not waste my years

浪费在贵族小姐的假面舞会上
planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

等到成年
And when I came of age...

我也必将远离那些奴隶城邦
I would never live in a slave city again.

我很抱歉 陛下
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

您向我诉说您的困境 我却只是沉缅于旧日的回忆之中
You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.

我不想和那个佛雷家的女孩结婚
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

我也不愿看到你和她结婚
I don't want you to marry her.

但你需要佛雷家的桥
But you needed that bridge.

我希望那是座非常美丽的桥
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

捣烂的酸樱桃都准备好了
The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.

闭嘴
Shut up.

或许已经在馅饼皮里了
Probably in the piecrust by now.

在烤炉里 温暖的烤炉里
In the oven, the nice warm oven.

闭嘴 你带了些什么过来？
Shut up. What did you bring?

我要是拿奶酪就好了
The cheese could be better.

虽然香肠也不错
I did get some nice sausages.

他想让我们拿那些守卫怎么办？
What did he want us to do about those guards?

他没说
He didn't say.

他只是说 “穿过那座大门”
He just said, "walk through the gates.

那守卫怎么办？
What about the guards?

他没说守卫怎么办
He didn't say anything about the guards.

什么 他把这事给漏了么？
What, he left that bit out?

这是挺重要的一部分 不对吗？
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

我们必须相信他，相信他？
We have to trust him. Trust him?

你相信他能帮我们打 就放他走了
You trusted him to fight with us and you set him free

然后他就不见了，我想回厨房去
and he ran. I want to go back to the kitchens.

闭嘴 如果你害怕了 就留在这里
Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

阿利 不要
Arry, don't.

发射！重新装填！
Away! Reset!

只要风不停 我们明天就能到君临
If the wind holds, we'll reach King's landing in a day.

风会继续吹？
Will it hold?

戴佛斯・席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩
狭海中的王

我不能替风向您保证 陛下
Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

再一次 使劲拉！

马索斯・席渥斯
戴佛斯之子

我尊敬你 戴佛斯爵士
I admire you, Ser Davos.

谢谢您 陛下 承蒙您的夸奖
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

有些贵族傻瓜叫你洋葱骑士
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight

而且以为这是侮辱你
and think they insult you.

你就真的把洋葱作为你的家徽
So you take the onion for your Sigil,

绣在你的衣服上 画在你的旗子上
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

我儿子希望我能把它改掉
My son wishes me to change it.

改成三条拿着三叉戟的人鱼 诸如此类
Three mermen with tridents, something like that.

我理解为什么那些古老的家族都看不起我
I understand why the older families look down at me.

是么？为什么？
Do you? Why?

我父亲是个捕蟹人，还有呢？
My father was a crabber. And?

唔 领主的儿子不愿意和捕蟹人的儿子共餐
Well, sons of Lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers.

我们的手臭得很
Our hands stink.

那么 当风息堡内忧外困的时候 他们在哪里？
And where were those Lords when Storm's End starved?

有很多在为令兄奋勇征战
Many fought bravely for your brother.

也有不少在为疯王打仗
Many fought for the Mad King.

你为那些背后羞辱过你的人辩护
You defend these men who insult you behind your back.

有些人喜欢当着我的面羞辱我
Some are happy to do it to my face.

我们被遗忘了
We were forgotten.

劳勃和奈德・史塔克 他们才是英雄
Robert and Ned Starkthey were the heroes,

伟大的反叛 一场接一场的战斗
the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle,

把无数城镇从疯王的压迫中解救出来
liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King

而我则率五百人守护风息堡
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

没有人忘记过您 陛下，没有么？劳勃忘了
No one has forgotten, Your Grace. No? Robert did.

战后他把风息堡给了蓝礼
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.

蓝礼从未打过仗
Renly never fought a day in his life.

当时的蓝礼只是个孩子
He was only a boy.

那为什么劳勃把风息堡给了他？
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

首先是马肉
First we ate the horses.

城堡被围困 马匹已无用武之地
We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded.

与其让马饿死 还不如宰了吃肉
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

然后是猫肉 我从来没有喜欢过猫
Then the cats. Never liked cats.

所以轮到猫了 我喜欢狗
So fine. I do like dogs.

忠诚的小东西
Good animals. Loyal.

不过我们照吃不误 然后是老鼠
But we ate them. Then the rats.

在你摸进来的前一晚
The night before you slipped through,

我妻子已经快不行了
I thought my wife was dying.

她说不了话 非常虚弱
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.

然后你穿过了封锁线
And then you made it through the lines.

黑色小船装满了洋葱
Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.

应该还有土豆和咸牛肉
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

那一夜 风息堡的每个人都恨不得亲你一口
Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.

幸好他们没有那样做
I was relieved they did not.

劳勃告诉我要守住风息堡 而我做到了
Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.

然后他说要把它交给蓝礼
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,

我也照办了
so I gave it up.

不管这是侮辱还是别的什么 我照办了
Insult or no, I gave it up

因为劳勃是我的长兄 是国王
because Robert was my older brother and he was the king

我永远都会尽我应尽的责任
and I've always done my duty.

但现在 依照所有维斯特洛的律法 我才是正统的国王
But now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.

当我坐上铁王座的时候 你会成为我的首相
And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.

陛下…
Your Grace...

我必将忠心侍奉您
I pray I serve you well.

你将是第一个佩戴这枚徽章的捕蟹人之子
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.

你是情报总管
You're the master of whisperers.

你理应知道所有的事情
You're supposed to know everything.

没有人能在同一时间出现在所有地方
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

我在北境安插了不少人手 陛下
I have many little birds in the North, My Lord,

但是自从席恩・葛雷乔伊控制了临冬城
but I haven't heard their songs

我就再也没听到他们的消息
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

史塔克家族的精力被分散了
The Stark forces are distracted.

乔佛里・拜拉席恩
铁王座上的王

现在是发起进攻的时刻了
Now is the time to strike.

进攻？
To strike?

我亲爱的外甥 你不是也看到了
My dear nephew, you do see these men

这些人在修的城墙是防守用的
preparing the walls for siege?

你不是知道史坦尼斯・拜拉席恩的舰队马上就到了么？
You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

如果我的史坦尼斯叔叔在君临的海岸登陆
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing,

我将亲自前去问候他
I'll ride out to greet him.

真是一个勇敢的决定 陛下
A brave choice, Your Grace.

我很确定你的人马会紧紧跟在你的身后的
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

他们说史坦尼斯从来不笑
They say Stannis never smiles.

我会给他划一个红色的微笑
I'll give him a red smile

从左耳根到右耳根
from ear to ear.

想象一下史坦尼斯的恐惧吧
Imagine Stannis's terror.

正想着呢
I am trying.

你是个聪明人
You're an intelligent man.

不谦虚地说 我也是个聪明人
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

哦 大人 此事毋庸置疑
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord,

即使是平时轻视你的人也不会怀疑
not even the multitudes who despise you.

我希望我们两个聪明人能收起谎言 好好谈谈
I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.

乐意之至
I wish we could, too.

你想要什么
What do you want?

告诉我
Tell me.

要玩游戏的话
If we're going to play,

得从你开始
you'll have to start.

我哥哥是史上最年轻的御林铁卫
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.

我姐姐十九岁就成为了王后
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

而当我成年的时候
When I reached manhood,

我的父亲任命我
my father put me in charge of all the drains

看护凯岩城的给排水系统
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

一位高贵的水管工
A most highborn plumber.

管道从来没有那么畅通
The water never flowed better.

所有的粪便都顺利排进大海
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

我从来未曾妄想过得到任何实权
I never expected to have any real power.

所以当父亲任命我为代理首相的时候
So when my father named me acting Hand

你很适合当御前首相 你知道么？
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

琼恩・艾林和奈德・史塔克都是好人
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men,

值得崇敬的人
honorable men,

但是他们鄙视这个游戏 鄙视它的玩家
but they disdained the game and those who played.

而你玩得很开心，没错
You enjoy the game. I do.

这是我最不期望见到的事情
Last thing I expected.

你还是个好玩家
And you play it well.

我希望能继续玩下去
I'd like to keep playing it.

如果史坦尼斯冲破了城门 游戏就结束了
If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.

听说他会把敌人活活烧死
They say he burns his enemies alive

以向光之王致敬
to honor the Lord of Light.

光之王希望他的敌人被烧死
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

淹神则希望他们被淹死
the drowned God wants them drowned.

为什么神灵都是这样邪魔般的存在？
Why are all the Gods such vicious cunts?

怎么就没有酒和色的神明呢？
Where is the God of tits and wine?

在盛夏群岛
In the Summer Isles,

人们信奉一位有十六个乳头的生育之神
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

我们应该立即去那里
We should sail there immediately.

今天早上我听到了一首歌儿
This morning I heard a song

从红色荒原那头的魁尔斯一路传来
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安还活着
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

我们没空理会一个远在世界尽头的女孩
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.

她还有三头龙
She has three dragons.

但即使传说是真的
But even if what they say is true,

幼龙成长起来还需经过漫长的岁月
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

但当它长大之后 我们就无处躲藏
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

没法同时下两盘棋 朋友
One game at a time, my friend.

小心 卡丽熙
Careful, Khaleesi.

这座城市属于札罗 男巫们有一千双眼睛
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1,000

在注视着你
eyes watching for you.

我找到一条
I found one

一条船 还有个好船长
a ship with a good captain.

她明天就要去往阿斯塔波
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

阿斯塔波？ 我们不能在这里停留
Astapor? We cannot stay here.

丹妮莉丝・坦格利安
风暴降生 龙之母

乔拉・莫尔蒙
熊老之子 “大熊”

他们夺走了我的龙
They have my dragons.

一个母亲不能丢下自己的孩子独自逃离
A mother does not flee without her children.

它们不是你的孩子
They're not your children.

我知道他们都叫你龙之母
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons

我也知道你爱它们 但它们不是你生的
and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb.

它们也未曾吮吸过你的乳汁 它们是龙 卡丽熙
They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi.

如果留在魁尔斯 我们都会死
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

你去阿斯塔波好了 那里很安全
You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.

你知道我会为你而死
You know I would die for you.

我永远不会抛弃你
I will never abandon you.

我已发下誓言 永远保护你 服从你
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

那就服从我的命令
Then serve me.

如果我的龙在不朽之殿
If my dragons are in the House of the Undying,

就带我去那里
then take me there.

那就中了男巫的圈套
That's what the warlock wants.

他也让你去那里
He told you so himself.

如果你进入不朽之殿 就永远不要妄想能离开
If you enter that place, you will never leave again.

他的魔法很强大，那我的魔法呢？
His magic is strong. And what of my magic?

你曾见过我步入火焰
You saw me step into the fire.

活活烧死那女巫的火焰 可曾伤到我？
You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me?

你还记得么？
Do you remember?

我到死都不会忘记
Until my last breath I will remember.

就算我已忘记了母亲的脸庞也还会记得
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

它们是我的孩子
They are my children.

而且它们是我一生中仅有的孩子
And they are the only children I will ever have.

带我去见它们
Take me to them.

我们应该埋了他们
We should bury them.

不如再多挂几天
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.

以儆效尤
Sends a message.

对那些脑袋不开窍的人
If they haven't got the damn message yet,

挂多少天都没用
a few more days won't help.

如你所愿
As you say.

但是多挂一会也没啥
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

这是什么？
What's this?

给那农夫的金子
Gold for the farmer.

给他的补偿
For his trouble.

他的事儿了结了
His troubles are done.

他被剁了作肥料
He's feeding the crops now.

鲁温
临冬城学士

还有他老婆
His wife, too.

欧莎
女野人

想要人不说话 就得让他永远闭嘴
You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.

逃到乡野之外 再折返回来
Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.

涉过小溪来摆脱猎狗的追踪
Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.

但愿他们永远不要想起这里
Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.

现在看来
You're right...

一切如你所愿
so far.

城门上挂着的
Who was that out there

是谁的尸体？
hung up the gates?

肯定是那农夫的孩子
Must have been the farmer's boys.

他杀了他们 烧了他们的尸体
He killed them and burned them

然后假装他们就是小王子？
and passed them off as the little lords?

嘘
Shh, shh, shh.

别让他们听见
They mustn't know.

布兰会为此而自责的
Bran would blame himself.

他们永远不会从我口中得知这些
They'll never hear it from me.

这两个小家伙承受的痛苦够多了
The little lads have suffered enough.

阿多
马僮

布兰・史塔克


瑞肯・史塔克
