第七季第三集  The Queen's Justice
女王的正义

弥桑黛
女王的翻译

提利昂·兰尼斯特
女王之手

临冬城的私生子
The bastard of Winterfell.

琼恩·雪诺
北境之王

戴佛斯·席渥斯
“洋葱骑士”

凯岩城的侏儒
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

我记得上次见面还是在绝境长城之上
I believe we last saw each other atop the Wall.

没记错的话 你站在长城边上撒了泡尿
You were pissing off the edge if I remember right.

你这一路走来 添了几道伤疤
Picked up some scars along the road.

长路崎岖 但我们最终还能相聚于此
It's been a long road, but we're both still here.

在下提利昂·兰尼斯特
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

戴佛斯·席渥斯 啊 原来是洋葱骑士
Davos Seaworth. Ah, the Onion Knight.

黑水河之役时我们各为其主
We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

我运气不佳
Unluckily for me.

这位是弥桑黛 女王的心腹谋士
Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.

欢迎来到龙石岛
Welcome to Dragonstone.

女王知道此次旅途漫长
Our queen knows it is a long journey.

我代表她感谢您所做的努力
She appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf.

不介意的话 请缴出兵器
If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.

那是自然
Of course.

请诸位随我前来
Please, this way.

你是哪里人？
Where are you from?

我听不出口音
I can't place the accent.

我生于纳斯岛
I was born on the Island of Naath.

啊 我听说那里非常漂亮
Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.

有棕榈树 有蝴蝶
Palm trees and butterflies.

可惜我没去过
Haven't been, myself.

这地方变了
This place has changed.

珊莎现在可好？我听说她平安无恙
And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.

她很好 她是否对我寤寐思服？
She is. Does she miss me terribly?

这桩婚事有名无实 我们从未圆房
A sham marriage. And unconsummated.

我没问过 就是 我是说 没有过
I didn't ask. Well, it was. Wasn't.

反正… 
Anyway...

她其实比看上去要聪明得多
she's much smarter than she lets on.

她已经开始展露锋芒了
She's starting to let on.

不错
Good.

有机会
At some point,

我倒想听听一个守夜人小卒是怎样成为北境之王的
I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit became King in the North.

你得先告诉我一个兰尼斯特家的人
As long as you tell me how a Lannister

如何会成为丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的御前首相
became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

那可是个漫长又血腥的故事
A long and bloody tale.

说实话 多半时候我都在醉生梦死
To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.

我的封臣们认定我愚不可及 才会前来龙石岛
My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.

他们做得对
Of course they do.

如果我是你的御前首相 我也会谏言反对
If I was your Hand, I would have advised against it.

都是经验之谈
General rule of thumb...

史塔克族人离家南下便会凶多吉少
Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.

没错
True...

但我并不姓史塔克
but I'm not a Stark.

卓耿
女王的黑龙

我想说你得习惯它们… 
I'd say you get used to them...

不过确实不容易
but you never really do.

来吧 它们的母亲在等你
Come, their mother is waiting for you.

梅丽珊卓夫人
光之王的祭司

我在想您为什么不去亲自迎接我们的客人
I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.

是您请求我们召见北境之王
You begged us to summon the King in the North.

您难道不想再见他一面？
Don't you want to see him again?

瓦里斯
“八爪蜘蛛”

我已经完成了我的使命
I've done my part.

我已促成冰与火的相聚
I've brought ice and fire together.

真是稀奇
Strange.

您对琼恩·雪诺不吝美言
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

可当他踏上龙石岛之时 您却躲在这峭壁之上
but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.

没想到您还是个如此害羞的女人
I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

我在列王耳畔呢喃的时代已经结束
My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.

哦 我深表怀疑
Oh, I doubt that.

我们这种平民一旦尝到权力的滋味
Give us common folk one taste of power,

如同恶狮尝到鲜血
we're like the lion who tasted man.

世上再无这般甜美滋味
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

你我早就不是平民了
Neither of us is common folk anymore.

我与北境之王 还有他的臣属
I did not part on good terms

上次分别得不太愉快
with the King in the North or his advisor.

为什么？
Why?

因为我曾犯下的错误
Because of mistakes I made.

弥天大错
Terrible mistakes.

我留下也只会扰乱人心
I would only be a distraction if I stayed.

那么您打算去哪里？ 瓦兰提斯
So, where will you go? Volantis.

明智
Good.

恕我直言
If you don't mind my saying,

您不该再回到维斯特洛
I don't think you should return to Westeros.

我可无法确保您在这里的安全
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

哦 我会回来的 亲爱的蜘蛛
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

最后一次 夫人… 
One last time. My lady...

我注定要死在这异乡
I have to die in this strange country.

您也一样
Just like you.

您面前的是
You stand in the presence

坦格利安家族的“风暴降生”丹妮莉丝
of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,

铁王座合法继承人
rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

安达尔人和先民的合法女王
rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

七大王国守护
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

龙之母
the Mother of Dragons,

大草海上的卡丽熙
the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

不焚者 镣铐破除者
the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.

这是琼恩·雪诺
This is Jon Snow.

他是北境之王
He's King in the North.

公爵大人 感谢您远道而来
Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.

但愿海浪不甚颠簸
I hope the seas weren't too rough.

风浪不大 劳陛下挂念
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

抱歉 可能我这口跳蚤窝口音让您误会了
Apologies, I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know,

琼恩·雪诺是北境之王 陛下
but Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.

您不该称他公爵 请问您是… 
He's not a lord. Forgive me...

陛下 这位是戴佛斯·席渥斯爵士
Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

恕我无知 戴佛斯爵士
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

我从未接受过正统教育
I never did receive a formal education,

但我得说 据我了解
but I could have sworn I read

托伦·史塔克是末代北境之王
the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark,

他曾臣服于我的先祖伊耿·坦格利安
who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

跪求我的先祖赦免他和他北境子民的性命
In exchange for his life and the lives of the Northmen,

托伦·史塔克发誓亘古亘今效忠坦格利安家族
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.

或者 是我搞错了？
Or do I have my facts wrong?

陛下 当时我并不在场
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

自然
No, of course not.

但盟誓即是盟誓
But still, an oath is an oath.

亘古亘今则是指… 
And perpetuity means...

提利昂大人 亘古亘今所指何意？
what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

永远
Forever.

所以 公爵大人 我认为… 
So I assume, my lord...

… 您该向我俯首称臣
...you're here to bend the knee.

可我不打算这么做
I am not.

哦
Oh.

那真是太可惜
Well, that is unfortunate.

您大老远跑来
You've traveled all this way

就是为了背弃祖先对坦格利安家族的誓言？
to break faith with House Targaryen?

背弃誓言？
Break faith?

令尊活活烧死了我的祖父
Your father burned my grandfather alive.

活活烧死了我的伯父
He burned my uncle alive.

他本来要将七大王国付之一炬… 
He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms...

我父亲… 是个坏人
My father... was an evil man.

我以坦格利安家族的名义
On behalf of House Targaryen...

请求您的宽恕
I ask your forgiveness

宽恕他对您的家族犯下的罪行
for the crimes he committed against your family.

请您不要以父亲的罪行
And I ask you not to judge a daughter

评判他女儿的品行
by the sins of her father.

千百年来我们的家族勠力同心
Our two houses were allies for centuries,

我们结成盟友的那几百年
and those were the best centuries

是七大王国最好的时代
the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.

千百年的太平盛世
Centuries of peace and prosperity

坦格利安国王端坐在铁王座上
with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne

北境守护史塔克家族镇守边疆
and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.

我是坦格利安最后的血脉 琼恩·雪诺
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.

请珍视你祖先向我先祖立下的誓言
Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.

臣服于我 我便会任命你为北境守护
Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.

我们联手 就能从祸国者手中
Together, we will save this country

拯救全境
from those who would destroy it.

您说得对
You're right.

您并不需要为您父亲的罪孽负责
You're not guilty of your father's crimes.

而我也不受祖先许下的誓言约束
And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.

那你为什么还要来？
Then why are you here?

因为我需要您的帮助 您也需要我的帮助
Because I need your help, and you need mine.

你来时有没有看见
Did you see three dragons

三条巨龙在你头顶飞翔？
flying overhead when you arrived?

看见了
I did.

那你有没有看见那些
And did you see the Dothraki,

立誓为我杀敌的多斯拉克人？
all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

他们很显眼
They're hard to miss.

但是你仍然说 我需要你的帮助？ 不是帮忙打败瑟曦
But still, I need your help? Not to defeat Cersei.

您可以明天就突袭君临 攻占整座城市
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.

妈的 我们当初没有龙都差点打下来了
Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.

差点 但您现在还没有突袭君临
Almost. But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

为什么呢？
Why not?

我认为 唯一的原因在于
The only reason I can see

您不想杀害成千上万无辜的百姓
is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.

杀人是赢得战争最快的方法
It's the fastest way to win the war,

但您不会这样做
but you won't do it,

这就说明 至少在这一点上
which means, at the very least,

您比瑟曦要好些
you're better than Cersei.

但这也说明不了我为什么需要你的帮助
Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.

因为现在 您 我 瑟曦 还有其他所有人
Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else,

我们像是一群玩耍中的孩子
we're children playing at a game,

尖叫着抱怨游戏的不公
screaming that the rules aren't fair.

你跟我说过你喜欢这个人 我确实说过
You told me you liked this man. I do.

从他见我开始的这段时间里 他拒绝称我为女王
In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen,

拒绝向我臣服 现在他又说我是个孩子
he's refused to bow, and now he's calling me a child.

我认为他说的是我们都是孩子 这是一种比喻而已
I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.

陛下 如果我们不击败北方的敌人
Your Grace, everyone you know will die before winter's over

所有您认识的人都会在冬天结束之前死去
if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.

在我看来 你就是那北方的敌人
As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.

我不是您的敌人
I am not your enemy.

亡者才是您的敌人
The dead are the enemy.

亡者？
The dead?

那也是一种比喻吗？
Is that another figure of speech?

亡者大军正在行进
The Army of the Dead is on the march.

亡者大军？
The Army of the Dead?

陛下 您也许并不十分了解我
You don't know me well, my lord,

但您觉得我像是骗子或者疯子吗？
but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?

不 我觉得您两者都不是
No, I don't think you're either of those things.

亡者大军是真实存在的
The Army of the Dead is real.

异鬼是真实存在的
The white walkers are real.

夜王也是真实存在的 我都亲眼见过
The Night King is real. I've seen them.

当他们越过长城时
If they get past the Wall

我们如果还在互相争斗… 
and we're squabbling amongst ourselves...

那我们就完了
we're finished.

我出生在龙石岛
I was born at Dragonstone.

但我并不记得这里
Not that I can remember it.

因为在劳勃派来的刺客找上门之前 我们就已经逃走了
We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.

劳勃是你父亲最好的朋友 对吧？
Robert was your father's best friend, no?

我在想 不知你父亲是否知道 他的挚友会派人
I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins

去杀害一个摇篮里的女婴
to murder a baby girl in her crib.

当然 这些现在都不要紧
Not that it matters now, of course.

我在异国他乡长大
I spent my life in foreign lands.

试图杀死我的人不计其数
So many men have tried to kill me,

我都记不清他们的名字了
I don't remember all their names.

我曾经像匹母马一样被人卖掉
I have been sold like a broodmare.

被人套上镣铐 又遭到背叛
I've been chained and betrayed,

被强暴 被侮辱
raped and defiled.

你知道在我流亡的这些年里
Do you know what kept me standing

是什么让我坚持住没有倒下吗？
through all those years in exile?

是信念
Faith.

不是对神的信仰
Not in any gods,

也不是对神话和传说的迷信
not in myths and legends.

而是对我自己的信念
In myself.

对丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的信念
In Daenerys Targaryen.

世人已经几百年没有见到过龙了
The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries

直到我的孩子们诞生
until my children were born.

多斯拉克人过去从未渡过海 任何海
The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea.

但他们为我做到了
They did for me.

我生来就是要统治七大王国的
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,

我也定会统治
and I will.

如果我们不打败夜王
You'll be ruling over a graveyard

您将统治的便是一片坟场
if we don't defeat the Night King.

讨伐我姐姐的战争已经开始了
The war against my sister has already begun.

您不能指望我们一边御敌
You can't expect us to halt hostilities

一边和您一起对付
and join you in fighting

您在绝境长城外所看到的那些东西
whatever you saw beyond the Wall.

您不相信他
You don't believe him.

这我理解 他的话听起来确实像胡扯
I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.

但如果命运让丹妮莉丝·坦格利安回到了维斯特洛
But if destiny has brought Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,

命运也同样使琼恩·雪诺成为了北境之王
it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.

您是第一个把多斯拉克人带到维斯特洛来的人？
You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

他可是第一个使野人和北方家族结盟的人
He is the first to make allies of wildlings and Northmen.

他被任命为守夜人的总司令
He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

他被尊为北境之王
He was named King in the North.

不是因为他的出身
Not because of his birthright.

他根本就没什么出身 他就是个私生子
He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard.

那些难伺候的龟孙们选择他当领袖
All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader

是因为他们相信他
because they believe in him.

那些您难以相信的事物
All those things you don't believe in,

他都亲自面对过
he faced those things.

为了他的人民 他与之奋战
He fought those things for the good of his people.

为了他的人民 他铤而走险
He risked his life for his people.

为了他的人民 他被刺穿心脏
He took a knife in the heart for his people.

他奉献出自己的… 
He gave his own...

如果我们不能放下彼此之间的敌意团结起来
If we don't put aside our enmities and band together,

我们都会死
we will die.

到那时 谁的骷髅架子坐在铁王座上都不重要了
And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

如果真的不重要 那你不妨现在就跪下
If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel.

向丹妮莉丝女王宣誓效忠
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,

帮助她打败我姐姐
help her to defeat my sister,

之后 我们的军队会联合起来保护北境
and together, our armies will protect the North.

没时间耗下去了
There's no time for that.

没时间浪费在这些破事上了！
There's no time for any of this!

当我们还傻站在这争论的时候… 
While we stand here, debating...

下跪花不了多少时间
It takes no time to bend the knee.

用你的剑向她起誓
Pledge your sword to her cause.

我为什么要那么做呢？
And why would I do that?

陛下 我无意冒犯
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

但我并不了解您
but I don't know you.

就我目前看来
As far as I can tell,

您对王位的宣称完全依赖于您父亲之名
your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name,

而我父亲正是为了推翻疯王而发动战争
and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.

北境诸侯
The lords of the North

信任我能够领导他们
placed their trust in me to lead them,

我将尽我所能继续履行我的职责
and I will continue to do so as well as I can.

很好
That's fair.

同样我也要指明
It's also fair to point out

我是七国合法的女王
that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

你宣称自己是北境的国王
By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom,

你就是公开造反
you are in open rebellion.

陛下 请让您的客人先退下
Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.

我有要事禀报
I have grave news.

请原谅我的失礼
You must forgive my manners.

远道而来 两位想必都累了
You'll both be tired after your long journey.

我们会为你们准备洗澡水 并把晚餐送到你们的房间
We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.

（多斯拉克语）

你这是要囚禁我？
Am I your prisoner?

暂时不是
Not yet.

我们的铁民和多恩盟友
Our ironborn and Dornish allies

在前往多恩的途中遭到袭击
were attacked en route to Dorne.

然后呢？ 仅有两三艘船逃脱
And? Two or three ships escaped,

其它的 被击沉或被俘虏
the rest, sunk or captured.

艾拉莉亚和沙蛇们 有的死了 有的被俘虏
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, dead or captured.

葛雷乔伊姐弟也一样下落不明
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

全部人？
All of them?

用力！ 向上拉！
Pull! Heave!

用力！
Pull!

你姐姐死了？
Your sister's dead?

她在攸伦手里
Euron has her.

你看见他抓住她了？
You saw him take her?

但是你逃掉了？ 我救不了她
But you got away? I couldn't save her.

我尽力了
I tried.

你要是尽力了就不会出现在这里
You wouldn't be here if you tried.

大伙 来吧！
Come, men!

升帆！
Sails up!

杀人犯！
Murderer!

攸伦·葛雷乔伊
铁群岛之王

亚拉·葛雷乔伊

婊子！
Whores!

叛徒！
Traitor!

特雷妮·沙德

艾拉莉亚·沙德

这才是人生
This is the life.

看看他们 为一位葛雷乔伊家族的人欢呼
Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.

实话实说
I have to be honest,

我都硬了
this is making me hard.

你有看到小席恩
Did you see Little Theon's face

跳海之前的表情吗？
right before he jumped overboard?

“噢 不！”
"Oh, no!"

真是个怂逼
What a twat.

婊子！婊子！婊子！杀人犯！
Whore! Whore! Whore! Murderers!

劳勃·斯壮
“魔山”

詹姆·兰尼斯特
“弑君者”

女王陛下 请接受我的礼物
My queen, please accept this gift

谨以此代表铁群岛所有忠诚的子民
on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
铁王座上的女王

我为您奉上的礼物无人能敌… 
I give you what no other man could give...

那就是正义
justice.

为您被害的女儿伸张正义
Justice for your murdered daughter.

你已经证明了自己是十四大洋上最好的船长
You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas

是王室真正的盟友
and a true friend to the crown.

您值得的不止一个真正的盟友
You deserve more than a true friend.

你的英勇事迹值得奖赏
And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.

我想要的奖赏只有一个
There's only one reward I want.

你会得偿所愿的… 
You shall have what your heart desires...

等赢了战争后再说
when the war is won.

由攸伦·葛雷乔伊指挥我们的海军
With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces

詹姆·兰尼斯特带领我们的陆军
and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,

维斯特洛的儿女们
the sons and daughters of Westeros

将保卫我们的国家
shall defend our country.

这真是无与伦比 对吧？
There's nothing quite like it, is there?

人民的爱戴
The love of the people.

不过我猜你应该并不了解
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.

还不是不久前向我姐姐吐口水的同一群暴民
This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.

如果你背叛我们
And if you turn on us,

他们就会看着你插在长枪上的脑袋欢呼
they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.

或者是你们的脑袋
Or yours.

他们确实就喜欢断掉的头
They just like severed heads, really.

听着 如果你有任何建议
Listen, if you have any advice at all,

我都很乐意听
I would love to hear it.

当我们闲下来可以像兄弟一样聊聊
When we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.

建议？
Advice?

她是喜欢温柔还是粗暴？
Does she like it gentle or rough?

喜欢手指插屁眼吗？
A finger in the bum?

嘘 嘘 嘘 嘘 别急 我们等会儿再聊
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now. We'll talk later.

我希望你明白我是理解你的
I want you to know I understand.

即使你我之间是敌人
Even though we're enemies, you and I,

我也懂得驱使着你的那种愤怒
I understand the fury that drives you.

那天我也在场
I was there that day

格雷果爵士捏碎了你情人的头
when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.

我闭上眼的时候
If I close my eyes,

都能听见奥柏伦头骨碎裂的声音
I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.

和你的尖叫声
The sound of your scream.

我从未听过那样的声音
I never heard a sound like that.

我想 “这就是真爱吧”
I thought, "That's true love."

奥柏伦那天看上去英俊无比 真的
Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did.

身法灵活无人能比
No one moved like him.

用长矛的技巧无可匹敌
No one had such skill with a spear.

就算格雷果爵士也拿他没辙
Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.

要是他没有接着嘲讽
If only he hadn't taunted him.

他大可以一走了之留下可怜的格雷果爵士等死
He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

但这就不是你情人的作风了 对吧？
But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?

现在他已在六尺之下
Now he's buried somewhere.

而格雷果爵士还在这里 且比任何时候都要强大
And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.

对你来说很难接受吧
That must be difficult for you.

当我的女儿从我身边被带走
When my daughter was taken from me,

我唯一的女儿… 
my only daughter...

算了 你不经历丧子之痛
well, you can't imagine how that feels

怎么能想象得到这种感觉
unless you've lost a child.

我用自己的乳汁喂养她
I fed her at my own breast even though they told me

尽管他们说可以让奶妈来做
to give her to the wet nurse.

我接受不了她被别的女人抱在怀里
I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.

我从未拥有过母亲
I never got to have a mother,

但弥赛菈拥有过
but Myrcella did.

她是我的 你却从我身边夺走了她
She was mine, and you took her from me.

你为什么这么做？
Why did you do that?

现在也不重要了
Doesn't matter now.

你的女儿也是个美人
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

瞧这棕色的眼睛
Those brown eyes.

这嘴唇
Those lips.

多么完美的多恩美人
Perfect Dornish beauty.

她一定是你的最爱
I imagine she's your favorite.

我懂 我懂 我们不该选最爱的那个
I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites,

但又怎样 我们不过是凡夫俗子
but still, we're only human.

我们该爱谁就爱谁
We love whom we love.

抱歉 我听不清你在说什么
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

堵着嘴我可没办法听清你说的话
That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.

一定很崩溃吧
It must be frustrating.

我们都做出了自己的选择
We all make our choices.

你选择杀害我的女儿
You chose to murder my daughter.

你做出那个选择后一定感觉充满力量吧
You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.

现在还觉得有力量吗？
Do you feel powerful now?

我睡不好
I don't sleep very well.

完全都睡不好
Not at all, really.

我躺在床上盯着华盖
I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy

想象着各种杀死自己敌人的方式
and imagine ways of killing my enemies.

如何摧毁艾拉莉亚·沙德 那个捏碎我掌上明珠的女人
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.

我想过让格雷果爵士
I thought about having Ser Gregor

像捏碎奥柏伦的头骨一样捏碎你的头骨
crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.

我想这会很有诗意 但是过程很快 太快了
It would be poetic, I suppose, but fast, too fast.

我想过让他捏碎你女儿的头骨
I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.

她这么美
She's so beautiful.

这张可爱的小脸
The thought of this lovely face

像鸭蛋一样被打碎裂开
cracking open like a duck egg,

不 这样不对
no, it's just not right.

妈妈
Mama.

科本是我认识的最聪明的人
Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.

科本
被剥夺项链的学士

聪明到知道你是用什么毒死了弥赛菈
Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.

漫长的再见 是这个的吧？
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

漫长的道别 就是这个
The Long Farewell. That's the one.

毒药多久发作？
How long does the poison take?

很难说…  可能几小时 可能几天
Difficult to say... hours, days.

取决于个人体质
It depends on the subject's constitution.

但必死无疑吧？噢 是的 陛下 当然了
But death is certain? Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

你的女儿将会死在这牢房里
Your daughter will die here in this cell,

而你将在这眼睁睁地看她死去
and you will be here watching when she does.

你将在这儿度过余生
You'll be here the rest of your days.

如果你绝食 我们就把食物硬塞进你喉咙里
If you refuse to eat, we'll force food down your throat.

你会活活看着你女儿腐烂
You will live to watch your daughter rot.

看着那张美丽的脸蛋塌陷下来… 
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

… 直至变成骷髅和灰烬
...to bone and dust.

从头到尾好好想想你做出的那些选择
All the while contemplating the choices you've made.

确保侍卫每隔几小时就换一次火把
Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.

我一点点都不想让她错过
I don't want her to miss a thing.

不
No.

别这样
Don't.

你在干嘛？不能让任何人看到我们
What are you doing? No one can see us like this.

我是七王国的女王 我乐意怎样就怎样
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.

原谅我 陛下
Forgive me, Your Grace.

布拉佛斯来的使者已经到了
The visitor from Braavos has arrived.

很好 我们需要换新床单
Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.

马上着手 陛下
At once, Your Grace.

不了 谢谢
No, thank you.

请节哀顺变 陛下
My condolences, Your Grace,

对于您儿子的死我深感遗憾
on the death of your son.

大家都说 他是个不错的年轻人
From all reports, he was a fine young man.

铁金库不是派你来此吊唁的
The Iron Bank didn't send you here to offer condolences.

吊唁还有祝贺
Condolences and congratulations.

泰楚·奈斯托斯
布拉佛斯铁金库的代表

祝贺您成为第一位统治七国的女王
To become the first ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

这是一个了不起的成就
that's quite an accomplishment.

铁金库欣赏您摆脱封建迷信束缚
The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition,

为王室排除
freeing the crown from elements

企图颠覆法律之徒的方式
who sought to subvert the rule of law.

贝勒大圣堂的爆炸是一场悲剧的意外
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.

确实如此 但有时候悲剧是必要的
Indeed, but sometimes tragedies are necessary

为了恢复秩序和理性的统治
to restore order and rational leadership.

铁金库想要回自己的黄金
The Iron Bank wants its gold back.

您父亲从未食言
Your father never minced words either.

但 没错 您的债务相当巨大
But, yes, your debts are considerable.

您现在四面受敌
And you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.

我们都知道战争有多耗费钱财
We both know how expensive war can be.

我们也都知道黄金能赢战争
And we both know gold wins wars.

您的财库已经空了
Your vaults are empty.

您已故丈夫的挥霍无度导致如此结果
Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.

您最富有的盟军 提利尔家族 现在是你们的敌人
Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies.

您被王座的觊觎者从各个方向包围
You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.

而铁金库想赌一把谁是赢家
And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.

我们不下赌注
We don't make bets.

我们只投资在可能成功的一方
We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.

不过是婉约说法的“赌”
A fancy way of saying "bet."

战争已经开始 我已获得首胜
The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.

我除掉了多恩的毒蛇
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

我的舰队掌控着狭海
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

是攸伦·葛雷乔伊的舰队掌控着狭海
Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊对我忠心耿耿
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

暂时如此
For now.

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安有三条成年巨龙
Daenerys Targaryen has three fullgrown dragons.

您的木船和喷火的巨龙相比能有怎样的优势呢？
How well do wooden ships fare against firebreathing dragons?

她的龙或许没有某些人想的那样坚不可摧
Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.

不过倒是可以来说说这个坦格利安家的女孩
But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.

你想要在她身上投资？
You want to invest in her?

我猜铁金库在奴隶贸易上投资了相当可观的金子吧
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.

考虑到丹妮莉丝已经解放了所有的奴隶
How are your profits

你的收益怎样？
now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?

奴隶贸易已经进入了一个低迷期 这的确是事实
The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true.

据我所知 她把她自己看作
From what I gather, she considers herself

一个革命者而不单单是一个统治者
more of a revolutionary than a monarch.

就你的经验而谈 银行家与革命者的交易通常做得怎么样呢？
In your experience, how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?

兰尼斯特家族欠了铁金库一大笔钱
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money,

但是兰尼斯特有债必还
but Lannisters always pay their debts.

被解放的奴隶 多斯拉克人 还有巨龙 会这样吗？
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

有其父必有其女 果真如此
Your father's daughter, indeed.

给我两周时间
Give me a fortnight.

请作为贵宾留在君临
Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.

当你返回布拉佛斯时
And when you return to Braavos,

我发誓 我的债务将悉数还清
I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.

我到这里反省 没能预判到葛雷乔伊的袭击
I came down here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

你这样是在为难我啊
You're making it difficult.

你看上去比我反省得深刻多了
You look a lot better brooding than I do.

你让我感到好像我没在反省自己的错误
You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.

在这个岛上 我是个囚犯
I'm a prisoner on this island.

我可不这么认为
I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.

你可以自由出入城堡
You're free to walk the castle,

走到沙滩 去你想去的地方
the beaches, to go wherever you want.

除了我的船
Except to my ship.

你们拿走了我的船
You took my ship.

我可不这么认为
I wouldn't say we took your ship.

我没心思和你玩文字游戏
I'm not playing word games with you.

亡者大军正冲着我们所有人而来
The dead are coming for us all.

你为何不想想你能做些什么
Why don't you figure out what to do

来弥补我那些损失的船只和被杀的盟友
about my missing fleet and murdered allies,

而我会想想我能做些什么帮你解决那些会走的死人
and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.

我很难彻底明白 真的很难
It's hard for me to fathom. It really is.

要是有人和我说起异鬼和夜王… 
If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...

你可能也不相信我
You probably don't believe me.

事实上 我相信你
I do, actually.

过去你可不信
You didn't before.

你叫它们“古怪精灵”
"Grumkins and snarks," you called them.

你还记得吗？
Do you remember?

你说过那一切都是胡扯
You said it was all nonsense.

那就是胡扯 每个人都知道
It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.

不过紧接着莫尔蒙看到了他们
But then Mormont saw them

你也看到了他们
and you saw them.

而我相信诚实之人所见之事
And I trust the eyes of an honest man

胜过相信普遍的认知
more than I trust what everybody knows.

我如何才能说服不认识我的人
How do I convince people who don't know me

那些他们认为不存在的敌人会杀光他们？
that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?

是个好问题 我知道这是个好问题
Good question. I know it's a good question.

我正在寻求答案
I'm looking for an answer.

人们的思维不是为这么复杂的问题准备的
People's minds aren't made for problems that large.

比起异鬼 夜王
White walkers, the Night King,

亡者大军… 
Army of the Dead...

面对我姐姐
it's almost a relief to confront

这样一个更让人自在 熟悉的怪物 几乎就是解脱了
a comfortable, familiar monster like my sister.

我需要帮助我的人民准备应对即将来临的事情
I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.

呆在这里可不行
I can't help them from here.

我想离开
I'd like to leave.

如果你这么轻易地放弃
It seems unlikely that you became King in the North

我看你不太可能成为北境之王
by giving up that easily.

每个人都告诉我要从我父亲的错误中吸取教训
Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.

不要南下
Don't go south.

不要回应疯王的女儿的召唤
Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter,

她是外来的侵略者
a foreign invader.

可我还是来了
And here I am,

一个来自北方的傻瓜
a Northern fool.

子辈并不是他们的父辈
Children are not their fathers,

幸好我们都是这样
luckily for all of us.

有时对于外来侵略者
And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders

和北方的傻瓜来说要做的不仅仅是会面
and Northern fools than meets the eye.

丹妮莉丝本可以很久以前就向维斯特洛启航 但她没有
Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

她反而留在了她所在之处
Instead, she stayed where she was

拯救许多人于水火之中
and saved many people from horrible fates,

他们当中有些人正和我们一起在这岛上
some of whom are on this island with us right now.

当你在这里做客时
While you're our guest here,

你或许可以考虑询问他们
you might consider asking them

对于疯王的女儿他们怎么想
what they think of the Mad King's daughter.

她保护人民不受怪物的危害
She protects people from monsters,

就像你一样
just as you do.

这就是她来到这里的原因
It's why she came here.

她不打算北上
And she's not about to head north

去抵抗她从未见过的敌人
to fight an enemy she's never seen

仅凭一个她不认识的人所说的话
on the word of a man she doesn't know.

和一次简单的会面
After a single meeting,

这并不是一个合理的要求
it's not a reasonable thing to ask.

那么 你有没有合理一些的要求？
So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?

你什么意思？
What do you mean?

或许你真是一个来自北方的傻瓜
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

我在问有没有我能够帮到你的事情
I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.

龙晶？ 对
Dragonglass? Yes.

也叫火山玻璃 黑曜石
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

他说您这里有着巨大储量的龙晶
He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.

怎么就说到玻璃了？
Why are we talking about glass?

我们刚刚失去两个盟友
We just lost two of our allies.

所以我刚才在和琼恩·雪诺交谈 他是潜在的盟友
Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

那北境之王想要龙晶来做什么？
And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?

看起来 它可以制成武器
Apparently, it can be turned into weapons

来杀死异鬼和他们的走卒
that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.

或者是阻止他们
Or stop them.

毁灭他们
Destroy them.

我也不确定该用哪个词
Unsure about the nomenclature.

那关于这亡者大军 异鬼和夜王
And what do you think about this Army of the Dead

你怎么看？
and white walkers and Night Kings?

我很想相信琼恩·雪诺是错的
I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong.

但是一个贤者曾说过 你绝不应相信一件事
But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing

只是因为你的一厢情愿
simply because you want to believe it.

哪位贤者说的这句话？
Which wise man said this?

我不记得了
I don't remember.

你是想把你自己的观点假托先贤之智来阐述吗？
Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?

我绝不会
I would never do that.

对你这样做
To you.

我相信琼恩·雪诺是因为 他来到了这里
The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.

他所有的谋臣都告诉他不要来
All of his advisors would have told him not to come.

我也会告诉他不要来
I would have told him not to come.

可他还是来了
And he's here anyway.

您不必相信他
You don't have to believe him.

让他开采龙晶去吧
Let him mine the dragonglass.

如果他错了 那龙晶也是分文不值
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

您甚至都不知道它在这里
You didn't even know it was here.

它对您来说什么都不是
It's nothing to you.

给他些他认为有用的东西
Give him something by giving him nothing.

试着去和一个潜在的盟友
Take a step toward a more productive relationship

建立一个更有成效的关系
with a possible ally.

让他有事可做 而我们专注于手中的任务
Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand...

拿下凯岩城
Casterly Rock.

戴佛斯爵士怎么说的来着
What was that Ser Davos said

为了他的人民 他被刺穿心脏？
about taking a knife in the heart for his people?

你注意到了吗？
Did you notice that?

您得原谅他们的异想天开
You must allow them their flights of fancy.

北方是很乏味的
It's dreary in the North.

多么神奇的生物
Amazing thing to see.

我用我的兄长命名他们 韦赛里斯和雷加
I named them for my brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.

如今他们都去世了
They're both gone now.

你也失去过两个兄弟
You lost two brothers as well.

人们认为龙永远消失了 可现在它们活生生的
People thought dragons were gone forever, but here they are.

或许我们都该审视一下我们的认知
Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.

你和提利昂聊过了
You've been talking to Tyrion.

他是我的首相
He is my Hand.

他很喜欢说话 我们都喜欢做我们擅长的事情
He enjoys talking. We all enjoy what we're good at.

我就不喜欢
I don't.

你知道我不会让瑟曦一直坐在铁王座上
You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

当然
I never expected that you would.

我也没有改变
And I haven't changed my mind

哪些王国属于铁王座的想法
about which kingdoms belong to that throne.

我也没有
I haven't either.

我会允许你开采龙晶 用它锻造武器
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

你需要的任何资源和人力 我都提供
Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.

谢谢你
Thank you.

所以 你是相信我关于夜王和亡者大军的那些话了？
So you believe me, then, about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?

你应该开工了 琼恩·雪诺
You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.

我们还有多少储粮？
How much do we have?

珊莎·史塔克

整整一千蒲式耳 小姐
A full thousand bushels, my lady.

多还是少？
What does that mean?

对于临冬城现有居民来说
For the current occupants of the castle,

约恩·罗伊斯
“青铜” 符石城伯爵

这些食物够吃一年 也许一年多
it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.

过去一百年间最长的冬天有多长？
And what's the longest winter in the past hundred years?

培提尔·贝里席
“小指头”

呃 我不太确定
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

我 我会查查鲁温学士的记录
II'll check Maester Luwin's records.

他把每封渡鸦来信都做了存档
He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

你的意思是 我们粮食不够了
You're telling me we don't have enough food,

如果北境军队回来守卫临冬城 就更不够了吧
especially not if the armies of the North come back to defend Winterfell?

是的 小姐 应该不能够
No, my lady, most likely not.

那我们必须为未来的不测做准备了
Then we must prepare for that eventuality.

不管威胁从何而来
Whatever direction the threat comes from,

这里都是最好的容身之处
this is the best place to be.

我们要开始建造粮仓
We need to start building up our grain stores

北境每个城堡都要定期运来粮食
with regular shipments from every keep in the North.

如果冬天过去了 粮食仍有剩余 我们就将其归还
If we don't use it by winter's end, we'll give it back to them.

但是如果北境人都逃来临冬城
But if the entire North has to flee to Winterfell,

那就不用把时间浪费在运送粮食上了
they won't have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.

您很明智 小姐
Very wise, my lady.

沃尔肯学士 务必办好此事
Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

他们在用皮革覆盖胸甲吗？
Are they covering those breastplates in leather?

不是 小姐
No, my lady.

不这么做的话 凛冬真正至此的时候怎么办？
Well, shouldn't they be? Once the real cold comes?

他们确实应该这么做
They should, indeed.

先行告退 小姐
Pardon me, my lady.

我问你 为什么这上面没覆皮革？
You there, why isn't there leather on these?

你很适合当领导者
Command suits you.

北境人都面向北方
The Northerners are all facing north,

担忧着长城外的威胁
worried about the threat from beyond the Wall.

本来就该这样
So they should be.

我是这里最了解瑟曦的人
I know Cersei better than anyone here.

如果你忽视她… 
If you turn your back on her...

你不是这里最了解她的人 我只想说… 
You don't know Cersei better than anyone here. I only meant to say...

那个杀害了我父母兄长的人非常危险是吗？
That the woman who murdered my mother, father, and brother is dangerous?

感谢您睿智的忠告
Thank you for your wise counsel.

只有两种可能的结果
One of two things will happen...

一种是死人打败活人
either the dead will defeat the living,

这样的话
in which case...

我们所有的问题都结束了
all our troubles come to an end,

另一种是活人胜出
or life will win out.

然后呢？
And what then?

不要单纯地在北境或南方作战
Don't fight in the North or the South.

永远在脑海中设想每一场战斗
Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.

每个人都是你的敌人
Everyone is your enemy,

也都是你的朋友
everyone is your friend...

所有可能的事件都同时发生
every possible series of events is happening all at once.

这样就不会有出乎你意料之事
Live that way and nothing will surprise you.

发生的每件事都会是
Everything that happens will be something

你曾经设想过的
that you've seen before.

珊莎小姐 请到城门来
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

布兰·史塔克
绿先知

梅拉·黎德

你好呀 珊莎
Hello, Sansa.

我希望琼恩也在
I wish Jon were here.

我也是 我有话要对他说
Yes, I need to speak to him.

你是父亲唯一在世的嫡子
You're Father's last living trueborn son.

你现在是临冬城公爵了
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

我永远不会是临冬城公爵
I can never be Lord of Winterfell.

我永远不能封爵封侯
I can never be lord of anything.

我是三眼乌鸦
I'm the ThreeEyed Raven.

我不知道这是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

很难解释
It's difficult to explain.

那就试着解释 求求你 就当是为了我
Try. Please, for me.

这意味着我有能力洞察一切
It means I can see everything.

任何人发生过的任何事
Everything that's ever happened to everyone.

任何当下发生的事
Everything that's happening right now.

现在对我来说都是时间的片段
It's all pieces now, fragments.

我需要学会更好地洞察一切
I need to learn to see better.

当长夜再次降临
When the Long Night comes again,

我要准备好
I need to be ready.

你怎么知道这些的？
How do you know all this?

三眼乌鸦教给我的
The ThreeEyed Raven taught me.

你不是说你就是三眼乌鸦么
I thought you were the ThreeEyed Raven.

我告诉你了这很难解释
I told you it's difficult to explain.

布兰… 
Bran...

我为你经历的那些事感到伤心
I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.

我很伤心 那些事发生在这个家里
I'm sorry it had to happen here in our home.

那个夜晚真美
It was so beautiful that night.

雪花飘落 就像现在
Snow falling, just like now.

而你那么美
And you were so beautiful...

穿着白色的结婚礼服
in your white wedding dress.

我必须回去了 布兰
I have to go back inside, Bran.

我要再待一会儿
I'll stay a bit longer.

嗯
Hmm.

安布罗斯
学城博士

山姆威尔·塔利
学城学徒 蓝道·塔利的长子

乔拉·莫尔蒙
“大熊”

嗯
Hmm.

疼吗
Does it hurt?

有点疼 比原来要轻
A bit. Less than before.

看起来感染消退了
The infection no longer appears to be active.

真稀奇
Unusual.

不应该啊
Unlikely.

就算有人说是表层患病皮肤被剥掉了
One could almost be forgiven

似乎都说得过去
for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided

此外 皮下的部分还给上了药膏
and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.

不知道你说的是什么
Don't know anything about that.

我就是觉得有所好转了
I just started feeling better.

我猜是休息起作用了
I assumed it was the rest that did it.

还有气候
And the climate.

气候
The climate.

您可以离开了 爵士
You're free to go, ser.

这间屋子是给传染病病人的
This chamber is needed for the infectious,

而你不再是了
which you are no longer.

塔利 今晚我想在我的书房和你谈谈
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.

这事有多严重？
How bad is it?

到了晚上我就知道了
Suppose I'll find out this evening.

你要去哪？
Where will you go?

我从看到自己染病的那刻起 就向它投降了
I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.

我知道自己会病死
I knew it would kill me

或者在那之前自杀
or I'd kill myself before it could.

风暴降生丹妮莉丝让我相信还有希望
Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.

我的归宿就是回到她身边
The only place for me is back with her.

我欠她一条命
I owe her my life.

也欠你的
Her and you.

你父亲不止一次救过我
Your father saved me more than once.

我无以为报
It's the least I could do.

也许我们会再次相遇
Perhaps our paths will cross again.

希望如此
I hope they do.

你给他提供治疗了？是的
You treated him? Yes.

谁叫你治他的？
Who told you to treat him?

没人
No one.

谁曾禁止你 禁止任何人试图治疗他？
Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?

我记得是你
I seem to remember you.

即便如此你还是治疗了他？是的
But you treated him anyway? I did, yes.

我禁止你 是因为这样做危险 成功率低
I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful,

尤其是他那个年纪的患者
especially on someone of that age.

你可能让自己和他人都被传染
You could have infected yourself and others.

你可能毁了整个学城
You could have devastated the entire Citadel.

但你没有
But you didn't.

这个手术需要绝对谨慎 非常难以实施
It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.

很多链条上有医术之环的学士
Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links

其尝试都以失败告终
have attempted it and failed.

你却成功了
Yet you succeeded.

你怎么做到的？
How?

我研读了书本 遵循上面的指导
I read the books and followed the instructions.

那个人因你而生
That man is alive because of you.

你应该为之自豪
You should be proud.

谢谢你 博士
Thank you, Archmaester.

到这来
Come here.

这些手稿和卷轴都要霉烂了
All these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away.

我需要你把他们另外抄写一份
I need you to make copies of them.

你在想奖赏
You were expecting a reward.

你的奖赏就是不被学城即刻驱逐
Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.

你最好开始干活
You'd better get started.

小心纸里的蛀虫
And careful of the paper mites.

它们也喜欢人肉
They like flesh as well.

我们得找到攸伦·葛雷乔伊的舰队 并将其击沉
We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

陛下 他已经摧毁了我们的大部分
Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.

如果派剩余的船追击… 
To send our remaining ships after him...

我说的不是派船去追
I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.

您有必要亲自去吗？
Would you have to go yourself?

攸伦的舰队可能在任何地方
Euron's ships could be anywhere

也可能分散各地
or in more than one place.

真不知道 您要在开阔的海面上
You'd be flying around the open seas alone

独自飞多久啊
for who knows how long.

我不是独自去
I wouldn't be alone.

我有卓耿 韦塞里昂和雷哥
I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal.

凡人能拿它们怎样？
What can anyone do to them?

可敌人能染指于您
They can still do something to you.

哪怕一支利箭呢
It only takes one arrow.

这么做风险太大 您可是重中之重
It's too great a risk. You're too important.

凯岩城那边情况如何？
What about Casterly Rock?

无垢者将很快抵达凯岩城
The Unsullied will be there soon.

他们会面临什么情况？
And what will they face?

一场血战
A difficult situation.

他们知道我们会来
They know we're coming.

没错 瑟曦认定我毕生的目标
Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life

就是摧毁兰尼斯特家族
is to destroy House Lannister.

她必然有所防备
She will be ready.

从未有人能攻下凯岩城 弓箭手！
No one has ever taken the Rock. Archers!

兰尼斯特大军仍是那支由我父亲亲手打造的军队
The Lannister Army is still the army my father built.

准备战斗！ 他们训练有素 补给充足
Come on! Welltrained and wellprovisioned.

驻军至少万人以上

10,000 men at least.

他们知道我们会来
They will see us coming.

灰虫子
无垢者指挥官

一定是严阵以待
They will be ready.

拉弓！ 放箭！ 放！
Draw! Loose! Loose!

凯岩城大门固若金汤
The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.

高墙难以逾越
The fight up the walls will be hard.

局面对我们不利
We will be at a disadvantage.

伤亡绝不会少
Many men will die.

正如我父亲当年所言
Just as my father said they would.

关于我父亲 有些事很有意思
Interesting thing about my father...

他重振整个家族于危难之际
he built our house up from near ruin.

训练出一支强有力的部队 还建起了凯岩城
He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it,

可他却没铺设下水道
but he didn't build the sewers.

区区小事 何足劳动父亲大人
That was beneath him,

他把这活儿交给身边最不值一提之人
so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find...

也就是我
me.

没错 我身份低贱
He was right, I was low.

我身边的人 同样卑微
The company I kept, low.

大多数都是女人
Women, mostly.

在凯岩城 她们并不受欢迎
They weren't welcome at the Rock.

父亲也不认可我和她们厮混在一起
Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.

我没法带着她们从大门堂堂正正而入
Couldn't walk them through the front gates,

也不能把她们带到内廷
I couldn't have them in my chambers,

那么在修建水道的过程中
so in the process of building the sewers,

我为自己动了点小手脚
I threw in something for myself.

这是一条通道
It was a passage that began

起点在海边一个不起眼的小湾
in an out of the way cove by the sea

止于主哨塔的底部
and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.

没有哪儿比地底更适合追求低级趣味了
No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.

凯岩城宛如铜墙铁壁 这话儿没错
Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.

但我某个朋友也曾说过
But as a good friend of mine once said,

“来十个好手 我定能把这个贱人干翻”
"Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."

于是好戏上演
And so it begins.

无垢者直面兰尼斯特军队
They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.

他们以少迎多
They will be outnumbered.

且装备不足
They will have less armor and fewer weapons.

可兰尼斯特军队是出于恐惧而效忠我的姐姐
But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.

无垢者则为了更宏伟之愿
The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.

那就是自由
They will be fighting for freedom

以及解放他们的人
and the person who gave it to them.

他们为您而战
They will be fighting for you.

正是如此 我们胜券在握
And that is why they will triumph.

没人了

应该不止这点兵力

还有更多人才对



人呢？！
Where are they?!

兰尼斯特其他士兵哪去了？
Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

狄肯·塔利
蓝道·塔利的次子

蓝道·塔利
角陵伯爵

黑水河的波隆
爵士

奥莲娜夫人
“荆棘女王”

都结束了 对
It's done. It is.

如今 雨水在我们厅中哭泣
And now the rains weep o'er our halls.

我们打得漂亮吗？
Did we fight well?

呃 跟预想中的差不多吧
Uh, as well as could be expected.

战斗从不是我们的强项
It was never our forte.

毕竟是金玫瑰
Golden roses, indeed.

你的弟弟和他的女王
Your brother and his new queen

认为你眼下应在镇守凯岩城
thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.

事实却是凯岩城的价值已大不如从前
The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.

怎么说呢 凯岩城对我非常珍贵
Well, it is to me,

但我的童真岁月
but my fond childhood memories

可不能帮瑟曦坐稳王位
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

那你就这么拱手让人了？
So you just let them take it?

那只是暂时的 他们没法长期守住城
For now. They won't be able to hold it.

攸伦·葛雷乔伊率军烧了他们的船只
Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,

在离开之前 我们清空了粮仓
we emptied the larders before we left.

最终他们不得不放弃这个据点
Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position

横穿维斯特洛大陆
and march all the way across Westeros.

而你带着你的军队 你的绝对主力
And you took your army, your real army,

去了他们不本该去的地方
and went where they weren't.

罗柏·史塔克在呓语森林就是这样摆了我一道
As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.

人总得从失败中吸取教训
There are always lessons in failures.

的确 现在的你一定是个智者了
Yes. You must be very wise by now.

父亲总说我学东西慢
My father always said I was a slow learner.

如果他当真聪明
If he was so clever,

为什么他不在金矿枯竭时
why didn't he take Highgarden

就拿下高庭呢？
the moment your gold mines ran dry?

我想 很快我就能当面问问他了
I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.

从我的错误就没什么教训可学了 对吧？
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?

你打算怎么动手？
How will you do it?

用那把剑吗？
With that sword?

那曾是乔佛里的剑吧？
That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?

可他没机会用
Not that he ever used it.

叫什么来着？
What did he call it?

寡妇之嚎
Widow's Wail.

他真是个混蛋啊
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

为了保护家庭 我做了难以启齿的事
I did unspeakable things to protect my family.

或看着这些事按我的命令被人执行
Or watched them being done on my orders.

我从不会因此难以入睡
I never lost a night's sleep over them.

这些手段都是必要的
They were necessary.

为了提利尔家的安全
And whatever I imagined necessary

我做了能想到的一切
for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.

但你的姐姐所做的… 
But your sister has done things...

我压根无法想象
I was incapable of imagining.

这是我的错误 理应受罚
That was my prize mistake...

错在缺乏想象力
a failure of imagination.

她是个怪物 你明白的吧？
She's a monster, you do know that?

对你来说 的确如此
To you, I'm sure.

对其他人来说也是一样
To others as well.

可是 我们获胜之后 反对的人将烟消云散
But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us,

而人们平静地生活在瑟曦一手建立的国度
when people are living peacefully in the world she built,

你真认为他们会计较她达成的方式吗？
do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?

你爱她
You love her.

你的确爱着她
You really do love her.

可怜的傻瓜
You poor fool.

你会折在她的手里
She'll be the end of you.

或许吧
Possibly.

就算这样
Not much to be gained

和你讨这些也不会有什么益处 不是吗？
from discussing it with you, though, is there?

那你有更好的讨论对象吗？
What better person to discuss it with?

谁还能像我一样保证
What better guarantee could you have

你说的话一定不会传出这间屋子？
that the things you say will never leave this room?

或许 你是对的
But perhaps you're right.

如果她能把你带偏这么远
If she's driven you this far,

那一定有什么是你根本控制不了的
it's gone beyond your control.

对
Yes.

是这样的
It has.

她是瘟神
She's a disease.

我后悔自己曾为虎作伥
I regret my role in spreading it.

你也会后悔的
You will, too.

就这样吧
I think we're done here.

打算怎么动手？
How will it happen?

瑟曦有好几个想法
Cersei had several ideas.

让你游街
Whipping you through the streets

在红堡前斩首
and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.

活剥你 把你吊在君临城外墙上
Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.

我说服了她
I talked her out of those.

会痛吗？
Will there be pain?

不会 我保证
No. I made sure of that.

那就好
That's good.

我讨厌你儿子那种死法
I'd hate to die like your son.

手掐着脖子
Clawing at my neck,

口吐白沫
foam and bile spilling from my mouth,

双眼充血 皮肤泛紫
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

作为御林铁卫 作为父亲
Must have been horrible for you,

你一定吓坏了吧
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

我也觉得挺可怕的
It was horrible enough for me.

触目惊心
A shocking scene.

根本不是我想象中那样
Not at all what I intended.

毕竟我之前没见过毒药发作
You see, I had never seen the poison work before.

告诉瑟曦
Tell Cersei.

凶手是我 我想让她知道这点
I want her to know it was me.

恢复对这片土地
My only venture at this moment

和人民的统治
is reestablishing control over this continent

是我当前的唯一赌注
and every person on it.

我的全部盟友都失败了
All my allies are gone.

局势对我不利
I'm losing.

您还有铁金库 只要金子运到
You can count on the Iron Bank. As soon as the gold arrives.

就足够开展计划了
Enough with the clever plans.
