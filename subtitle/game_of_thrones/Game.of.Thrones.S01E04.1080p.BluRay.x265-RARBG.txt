根据长篇小说《冰与火之歌》改编
原著 乔治·R·R·马丁

第一季第四集 "Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things"
“残废,杂种,侏儒”

布兰·史塔克
临冬城公爵次子

小少爷又做梦了啊
The little lord's been dreaming again.

临冬城的老奶妈

我们有客人 我不想见人
We have visitors. I don't want to see anyone.

是嘛？要是我成天守着
Really? If I was cooped up all day

这老太婆不见人 我早疯了
with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.

反正你没得选 罗柏在等你
Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.

我不想去 我也不想
I don't want to go. Neither do I.

席恩·葛雷乔伊
临冬城公爵养子

可罗柏现下是临冬城主
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,

所以我得听他的 而你得听我的
which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.

阿多!
Hodor!

阿多？ 抱布兰去大厅
Hodor? Help Bran down the hall.

阿多
Hodor.

阿多
临冬城的马童 老奶妈的曾孙

不得不说 我上次来访比较受欢迎啊
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

只要是守夜人的弟兄 临冬城都欢迎
Any man of The Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.

尤伦
守夜人 “浪鸦”

‘只要是守夜人的弟兄’ 所以我不算啰 小子？
Any man of The Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?

提利昂·兰尼斯特
王后幼弟 "小恶魔"

罗柏·史塔克
临冬城公爵长子

兰尼斯特 我父亲不在的时候
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

我就是临冬城主 不是什么小子
I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.

那你好歹该懂点儿城主应有的礼貌
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

这孩子果真活下来了
So it's true.

你好 布兰
Hello, Bran.

你记得发生了什么吗？
Do you remember anything about what happened?

这孩子完全不记得那天的事情
He has no memory of that day.

奇怪  你到底来干嘛？
Curious. Why are you here

能让你这可爱的仆人蹲下吗？
would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?

看得我脖子痛 蹲下 阿多
My neck is beginning to hurt. Kneel, Hodor.

鲁温
临冬城学士

喜欢骑马吗 布兰？ 喜欢
Do you like to ride, Bran? Yes.

我是说 我以前喜欢
Well, I mean I did like to.

这孩子的腿已经不能用了 那又怎样？
The boy has lost the use of his legs. What of it?

有合适的马匹和鞍具 残废也能骑
With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.

我不是残废 那我也不是侏儒啰
I'm not a cripple. Then I'm not a dwarf.

我老爸听了不知多高兴
My father will rejoice to hear it.

我有礼物送你
I have a gift for you.

把这个交给你们的马鞍师傅 照着做就行了
Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.

你们得让马儿去适应他
You must shape the horse to the rider.

找匹未受训的一岁小马
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond

教它服从缰绳的指挥 教它认识这孩子的声音
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

我真能骑马吗？
Will I really be able to ride?

没问题
You will.

骑在马上 你跟别人一样高
On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.

你耍什么把戏？你为什么要帮他？
Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?

我嘛 心里有个小小的弱点
I have a tender spot in my heart

向来同情杂种 残废和其他怪胎
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

您帮了我弟弟一个大忙
You've done my brother a kindness.

就让临冬城款待您罢
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

少假惺惺啦 史塔克城主
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.

城外有家妓院
There's a brothel outside your walls.

我还是去那儿弄张床 这样咱俩都会睡得安稳些
There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.

抵挡不住北方妞的魅力是吗？
Couldn't resist some Northern ass?

不介意红发的话 去找罗丝
If you like redheads, ask for Ros.

专程来送我啊 葛雷乔伊？你太好心了
Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you.

可你的主子似乎不喜欢我们兰尼斯特家的人
Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.

他不是我主子 不是？这样啊
He's not my master. No, of course not.

那你告诉我 出什么事了？
What happened here?

凯特琳夫人上哪儿去了？她怎不出来接见我？
Where is Lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?

她身体不适 恐怕她不在临冬城吧？
She wasn't feeling well. She's not in Winterfell, is she?

她究竟上哪儿去了？ 我家夫人的行踪…
Where did she go? My Lady's whereabouts

你家夫人？
My Lady?

你这副奴才相还真让人感动啊
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

巴隆·葛雷乔伊若是得知自己仅剩的儿子
Tell me, how do you think balon Greyjoy would feel

成了别人的狗腿子会作何感想呢？
if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?

记得当年 我亲眼目睹
I still remember seeing my father's fleet

我老爸的舰队在兰尼斯港里被焚毁
burn in Lannisport.

是你几位叔叔干得的好事吧？
I believe your uncles were responsible?

那场面一定颇为壮观
Must have been a pretty sight.

无数水手被活活烧死当然很壮观
Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.

没错 那天你们赢得很漂亮
Yes, a great victory for your people.

可惜战争最终却是个奇耻大辱 我们是以一敌十…
Shame how it all turned out. We were outnumbered 10 to one

说明那是一次愚蠢的叛乱！
a stupid rebellion then.

当你哥哥们白白送命时
I suppose your father realized that

你老爸怕是该清醒了吧
when your brothers died in battle.

他还不得不赔上你 让你去做敌人的侍从
Now here you are, your enemy's squire.

当心你的舌头 小恶魔 冒犯你啦？
Careful, imp. I've offended you.

抱歉 这一早上够我受的
Forgive me, it's been a rough morning.

不管怎样 你不要太失望啊
Anyway, don't despair.

我打出生就让我老爸失望
I'm a constant disappointment to my own father

不也活得好好的？
and I've learned to live with it.

你下次跟罗丝风流算我请
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

放心 我不会把她干得下不了床的
I'll try not to wear her out.

肩 腿
Shoulder, legs.

腿 肩 腿
Leg, shoulder, leg.

左脚向前 很好
Left foot forward. Good.

出手的时候身体旋转
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.

葛兰
守夜人

全身的重量贯在剑上
Put all your weight behind it.

七层地狱啊 那家伙…
What in seven hells is that?

地狱怕是要多盖一层才塞得下他
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

派普尔
守夜人 亦称“派普”

告诉他们 你叫什么
Tell them your name.

山姆威尔·塔利
Samwell Tarly,

山姆威尔·塔利
守夜人

来自角陵 我的意思是…我曾经是角陵塔利家的人
of Horn HillI mean, I was of Horn Hill.

我前来加入黑衫军 你是来吃黑布丁的吧？
I've come to take the black. Come to take the black pudding.

雷斯特
守夜人

你总不至于比看上去更不中用
Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.

艾里沙·索恩
黑城堡的守夜人教头

雷斯特
Rast...

试试他有多厉害
See what he can do.

我投降
I yield.

求求你 别打了 给我起来
Please, no more. On your feet.

把剑捡起来
Pick up your sword.

揍他 直到他爬起来为止
Hit him till he finds his feet.

这年头南方连盗猎者和小偷都人手短缺
It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down South.

妈的 倒把哀嚎的猪送来守长城了 琼恩
Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Jon!

琼恩·雪诺
守夜人 临冬城公爵的私生子

再打！狠狠地打！
Again, harder.

我投降！
I yield!

够了！
Enough!

他投降了
He yielded.

看来 咱们的野种谈恋爱了
Looks like the bastard's in love.

好吧 雪诺大人
All right then, Lord Snow,

你打算为心爱的小姐挺身而出 就好好打一场吧
you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.

你俩过来
You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient

三个人应该够猪小姐受的了
to make lady piggy squeal.

你们只需打发掉挡路的野种
All you've got to do is get past the bastard.

你当真想打？ 当然不
Are you sure you want to do this? No.

投降投降投降！我投降
Yield yield yield! I yield.

今天就到此为止
We're done for today.

去打扫兵器库
Go clean the armory.

你们只配干这个
That's all you're good for.

打得漂亮嘛！ 滚开
Well fought! Piss off.

你受伤没？
Did he hurt you?

跟平时相比 这不算什么
I've had worse.

你愿意的话…可以叫我山姆
You can call me Sam... If you want.

我妈叫我山姆… 你知道 这事还没完
My mother calls me Samit's not going to get any easier, you know?

你以后必须保护自己
You're going to have to defend yourself.

你怎么不站起来反击？
Why didn't you get up and fight?

我也想
I wanted to.

可我就是做不到… 为什么？
I just couldn't. Why not?

我是个胆小鬼
I'm a coward.

家父常这么说 长城可不是胆小鬼该来的地方
My father always says so. The Wall's no place for cowards.

你说得对 对不起…
You're right. I'm sorry.

我…只想谢谢你
I just... wanted to thank you.

彻头彻尾的胆小鬼
A bloody coward.

别人看见咱们跟他说话了
People saw us talking to him.

搞不好会把咱们也当胆小鬼
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

你太笨啦 当不成胆小鬼
You're too stupid to be a coward.

你才笨得当不成… 当不成什么？
You're too stupid to be aQuick now,

趁夏天还没结束你快想呀
before summer's over.

你给我站住！
C'mere!

丹妮莉丝·坦格利安
卡丽熙

维斯·多斯拉克…马王之城
Vaes Dothrakthe city of the horselords.

不过是一堆泥巴
A pile of mud.

一堆泥巴 木头和马屎
Mud and shit and twigs

这帮野蛮人什么也不会 他们现在是我的族人
best these savages can do. These are my people now.

别再叫他们野蛮人了
You shouldn't call them savages.

我爱叫什么就叫什么 他们都属于我
I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.

韦赛里斯·坦格利安
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的二哥

这是我的军队
This is my army.

乔拉·莫尔蒙
杰奥·莫尔蒙之子

卓戈卡奥把我的军队带错了方向
Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.

假如我哥哥真的得到一支多斯拉克军队
If my brother was given an army of Dothraki,

你能助他征服七国吗？
could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

多斯拉克人从未渡过狭海
The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea.

只要马不能喝的液体他们都怕
They fear any water their horses can't drink.

假如他们渡过去了呢？
But if they did?

劳勃国王的确可能蠢到跟他们在旷野决战
King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle,

可他身边藏龙卧虎
but the men advising him are different.

你了解这些人吗？ 我曾与他们并肩作战
And you know these men? I fought beside them once,

很久以前的事了
long ago.

后来奈德·史塔克要我的脑袋
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

我不得不背井离乡
He drove me from my land.

你贩卖奴隶
You sold slaves.

是的
Aye.

为什么？ 我没钱
Why? I had no money

却有一个很会花钱的老婆
and an expensive wife.

她现在在哪儿？
And where is she now?

在一个遥远的地方
In another place,

在另一个男人怀里
with another man.

多莉亚
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的侍女

陛下？ 怎么啦 亲爱的？
Your Grace? Yes, my dear?

他们称您为最后的真龙传人…
They call you the Last Dragon...

是的
They do.

在您的血管里
You have dragon's blood

流淌着龙血吗？
in your veins?

这完全有可能
It's entirely possible.

世上的龙都去哪儿了？
What happened to the dragons?

我听说勇者屠龙
I was told that brave men killed them all.

勇者才不屠龙咧
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

勇者骑龙
The brave men rode them.

骑着龙从瓦雷利亚出发
Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization

建立了空前绝后的辉煌文明
this world has ever seen.

最强大的魔龙用其吐息
The breath of the greatest dragon

铸造了铁王座…
forged the Iron Throne,

就是现在篡夺者替我暖着的王座
which the usurper is keeping warm for me.

上千把
The swords of the vanquished,

被征服者的宝剑
a thousand of them...

像蜡烛一样镕铸在一起
Melted together like so many candles.

我一直梦想着去看龙
I have always wanted to see a dragon.

这是世界上我最想见识的东西了
There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.

为什么是龙呢？
Really. Why dragons?

因为他们会飞
They can fly.

只需挥动翅膀想去哪里就去哪里
And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings

去天涯海角…
and they're somewhere else...Far away.

因为他们有力量
And they can kill.

任何人 任何东西都不敢欺负他们
Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them

否则就会被烧成灰烬…
gets burned away to nothing...

…像蜡烛一样
...Like so many candles.

噢
Ow.

真的 要是能见到龙
Yes. Seeing a dragon

我会开心死的！
would make me very happy.

好吧 我以为你在妓院里待了十五年
Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,

见到蓝天都会开心死了
I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.

我又没被关起来 我见过不少世面
I was not locked in. I have seen things.

说说看呢？ 我见过…
What have you seen? I've seen...

佩带真正的龙晶匕首的亚夏人
A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass.

我见过
I've seen a man who could

有人变脸跟换衣服似的
change his face the way that other men change their clothes.

我见过一个穿金衣的海盗
And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold

他的船张着彩色丝绸的风帆
and whose ship had sails of colored silk.

那…
So...

您到底见过没啊？
Have you seen one?

见过海盗船？ 见过龙啦
A pirate ship? A dragon.

没有
No.

最后一条龙早在我出生以前就死了
No, the last one died many years before I was born.

但我告诉你 我见过:
I'll tell you what I have seen:

巨龙的头骨
Their skulls.

它们被用来装饰红堡的王座厅
They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.

我小时候 大概三四岁时
When I was very young, just three or four,

父王会带我去参观
my father used to walk me down the rows

他要我背诵他们的名字
and I'd recite their names for him.

如果全说对了 他就会奖励我糖吃
When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.

厅门边的龙是最后孵化的几只
The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch

都是发育不良的畸形
and they were all stunted and wrong.

头骨比猎犬的大不了多少
Skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

但随着你走近铁王座
But as you got closer to the Iron Throne...

龙头一个比一个大
They got bigger

一个比一个大
and bigger and bigger.

吉斯卡…
There was Ghiscar

瓦列利安…
and Valryon,

维米斯克…
Vermithrax,

伊索韦斯…
Essovius

阿克雷恩…
Archonei,

米拉西斯…
Meraxes,

瓦格哈尔…
Vhagar...

还有“黑死神”贝勒里恩
And Balerion the dread...

正是贝勒里恩的龙焰
...Whose fire forged

熔就了七大王国
the Seven Kingdoms

大一统的江山
into one.

那些头骨后来怎样了？
What happened to the skulls?

我不清楚
I don't know.

大概早已被篡夺者打成齑粉
The usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.

挫骨扬灰了吧
Scattered to the wind.

真令人伤感
That's very sad.

的确是
Yes, it is.

可我买你是做什么？
What did I buy you for?

为了让自己伤感吗？ 不是的 陛下
To make me sad? No, your Grace.

是为了 呃 教导您妹妹
To, uh, teach your sister.

教导我妹妹怎么上床？
To teach my sister how to be a better lover?

你以为我买你是为了便宜卓戈卡奥？
You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy?

噢 你这漂亮的小傻瓜
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

继续来啊 来啊
Go on then. Get on with it.

将来你的夫君会坐上铁王座
Someday your husband will sit there

而你将坐在他身旁
and you will sit by his side.

等你们有了儿子 你会带他进宫
And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.

茉丹
临冬城的修女

维斯特洛的王公贵族们会齐聚于此
All the Lords of Westeros

瞻仰小王子的…
will gather here to see the little prince

珊莎·史塔克
临冬城公爵长女

如果我生的是女孩怎么办？
what if I have a girl?

若诸神保佑 你会生下一大群儿女
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.

如果我只生女孩怎么办？
What if I only have girls?

瞎操心
I wouldn't worry about that.

珍妮·普尔的妈生了五个孩子 全是女孩
Jeyne Poole's mother had five childrenall of them girls.

这很罕见的
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

但如果呢？
But what if?

好吧 如果你只生女孩
Well, if you only had girls,

那王位就不得不传给乔佛里王子的弟弟
I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

这样每个人都会恨我
And everyone would hate me.

没有人恨你啊
Nobody could ever hate you.

乔佛里就恨我 胡说
Joffrey does. Nonsense.

你怎会说出这种话？
Why would you say such a thing?

珊莎 就因为狼的事吗？
That business with the wolves? Sansa,

我告诉你多少次了
I've told you a hundred times:

冰原狼不是… 请别再提这个了
A direwolf is notplease shut up about it.

算了 让我们说说课上的内容吧
Do you remember your lessons?

谁铸造了铁王座？
Who built the Iron Throne?

“征服者”伊耿
Aegon the Conqueror.

谁建造了红堡?
And who built the Red Keep?

“残酷的”梅葛
Maegor the Cruel.

它总共花了多少年才建成…
And how many years did it take to build

我爷爷和叔叔都死在这里 是不是？
my grandfather and Uncle were murdered here, weren't they?

嗯 他们是被伊里斯国王下令处死的
They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

“疯王”干的 嗯 老百姓们叫他“疯王”
The Mad King. Commonly known as the Mad King.

他为什么要杀他们？
Why were they killed?

这些问题你应该去请教你父亲
You should be speak to your father about these matters.

我不想跟我父亲说话…永远都不想！
I don't want to speak to my fatherever.

珊莎 总有一天
Sansa, you will find it in your heart

你会明白你父亲的苦衷
to forgive your father.

不 永远不可能
No, I won't.

诸位大人 这些麻烦都是
It's The Hand's tournament that's causing

艾德·史塔克
御前首相 临冬城公爵 昵称“奈德”

首相的比武大会带来的 国王的比武大会
all this trouble, My Lords. The King's tournament.

我跟你保证 首相对这事一点兴趣都没有
I assure you The Hand wants no part of it.

您怎么说都行 史塔克大人
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, Ser,

可事实是城里挤满了人 而每天都有更多人涌入
the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.

杰诺斯·史林特
都城守备队队长

昨儿晚上就有一起酒馆暴乱 一座妓院失火
Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

派席尔
大学士

三起持刀械斗 还有匹喝醉的马冲到静默修女街去了
three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.

蓝礼·拜拉席恩
风息堡公爵 国王幼弟

吓人哟 你要是连城里的秩序都无法维持
Dreadful. If you can't keep the King's peace,

恐怕都城守备队得换个有办法的人来当司令啰
perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can.

我需要人手 雇五十个新兵
I need more men. You'll get 50.

钱的事交给贝里席大人打点 我打点？
Lord Baelish will see it paid for. I will?

你连比武冠军的赏金都筹得出
You found money for a champion's purse,

培提尔·贝里席
财政大臣 “小指头”

多弄几个铜板维持秩序想必不成问题
you can find money to keep the peace.

我再从我的贴身护卫中拨二十个人给你
I'll also give you 20 of my household guard

直到城里这批人离开为止
till the crowds have left.

非常感谢 首相大人
Thank you, My Lord Hand, Ser.

我一定让他们派上用场
They will be put to good use.

闹剧早一天结束 我就早一天安心
The sooner this is over, the better.

王国就是因为这种事才兴盛的啊 大人
The realm prospers from such events, My Lord.

瓦里斯
太监 情报总管 “八爪蜘蛛”

这是上等阶级求取荣耀的大好时机
They give the great a chance at glory,

也能让老百姓们暂时忘忧解愁
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

还让城里的旅店通通客满
And every inn in the city is full

妓女接客接到合不拢脚
and the whores are walking bowlegged.

我毫不怀疑 某些人会借此大捞一笔
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.

那么
Now...

如果没别的事 大人们…
If there's nothing else, My Lords?

噢 天真热啊
Oh, this heat.

每到这种天气 我就羡慕你们北方人
On days like this, I envy you Northerners

还有夏雪
your summer snows.

明天见 大人…
Until tomorrow, My Lord

我一直想找您谈谈琼恩·艾林的事
I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

艾林公爵？
Lord Arryn?

噢 他的死对我们
Oh, his death was

是个沉重的打击
a great sadness to all of us.

我亲自出马照料他
I took personal charge of his care,

可惜还是无济于事
but I could not save him.

那病压垮了他
His sickness struck him

又快又猛
very hard and very fast.

他去世前一晚
I saw him in my chambers

还来我住的地方找我呢
just the night before he passed.

艾林大人经常找我商量国事
Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.

为什么？
Why?

我可是做了多年大学士
I have been Grand Maester for many years.

国王和首相都会来征求我的…
Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since

琼恩去世前那天晚上找你做什么？
What did Jon want the night before he died?

噢 他来找我要一本书
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

一本书？
A book?

什么书？
What book?

恐怕
Oh, I fear

您会觉得很无趣 大人
it would be of little interest to you, My Lord.

那是本大部头
A ponderous Tome.

没关系 我只想看看
No, I'd like to read it.

《七国主要贵族之世家谱系与历史》
"The Lineages and Histories of the Great H of the Seven Kingdoms,

内附关于许多爵爷
with descriptions of many high lords

夫人
and noble ladies

和他们子女的描述
and their children."

“哈孔·安柏一世”
"Harkon Umber, first of his name,

“为霍瑟·安柏伯爵与其妻阿米莉丝·安柏夫人所生之子”
born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber

“于伊耿登陆之后第一百八十三年”
in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing,

“降生于最后壁炉城”
at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair

“蓝眼睛 棕头发 肤色浅”
and fair complected, died in his 14th year

“十四岁时因猎熊负伤致死”
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt."

如我所言 大人 这是本无趣的书
As I said, My Lord, a ponderous read.

琼恩·艾林可曾告诉你他想在书中找什么？
Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?

他没说 大人 我也没冒昧多问
He did not, My Lord. And I did not presume to ask.

琼恩的死… 令人惋惜
Jon's death... Such a tragedy.

他病危时跟您说过什么吗？
...Did he say anything to you during his final hours?

没什么要紧的话 大人
Nothing of import, My Lord.

有一句
Ohthere was one phrase

他反复重复：
he kept repeating:

我记得是“种性强韧”
"The seed is strong," I think it was.

“种性强韧”
"The seed is strong"?

什么意思？
What does that mean?

所谓人之将死 其言易乱 史塔克大人
Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark.

人们往往过于看重遗言
For all the weight they're given,

其实遗言有时不比
last words are usually

初生儿的哭闹更有价值
as significant as first words.

你确信他是自然死亡？
And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?

不然会是什么呢？
What else could it be?

毒药
Poison.

这想法叫人不寒而栗
A disturbing thought.

不 不 不 我认为不可能
No no no, I don't think it likely.

首相大人广受爱戴
The Hand was loved by all.

怎会有人…
What sort of man would dare

我听说毒药是女人的武器
I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.

是有这种说法 女人…
Yes, women,

懦夫…
cravens...

还有太监
And eunuchs.

您可知道 瓦里斯伯爵是个太监？
Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch?

这事路人皆知
Everybody knows that.

是的是的 当然了
Yes yes, of course.

我想不通
How that sort of person found himself

这种人怎能成为御前会议里的重臣？
on the King's Council, I will never know.

我占用您太多时间了
I've taken enough of your time.

没关系 大人 为您服务是我的荣…
No trouble at all, My Lord. It's a great honor

谢谢您
thank you.

请留步
I'll find my own way out.

西利欧说水舞者

明天起我开始抓猫 猫？
Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. Cats?

西利欧说的？
Syrio says.

他说每个剑客都应该研究猫
He says every swordsman should study cats.

它们静如影 轻如羽
They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.

练出好身手才可能捉住它们
You have to be quick to catch them.

这点他说得很对
He's right about that.

现在布兰醒了
Now that Bran's awake

他会来跟我们一起住吗？
will he come live with us?

他得先恢复体力才成
Well, he needs to get his strength back first.

他一直想当御林铁卫
He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard.

现在当不成了 是不是？ 是的
He can't be one now, can he? No.

但有朝一日
But someday

他或能获得封地
he could be Lord of a Holdfast

或成为国王的重臣
or sit on the King's Council.

也或像‘筑城者’布兰登那样
Or he might raise castles

兴建雄伟的城堡
like Brandon the builder.

我可以获得封地吗？
Can I be Lord of a Holdfast?

你的儿子们会当上骑士
And your sons shall be knights

王子或领主

好吗？ 我不要
Hmm? No.

那不是我
That's not me.

你好
Hello.

艾里莎爵士让我跟你一起站岗
Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new Watch partner.

先申明一下
I should warn you,

我眼神不太好
I don't see all that well.

站到火堆边来吧
Come stand by the fire.

这里暖和些 没事儿 没事儿 我不冷
It's warmer. No, that's all right. I'm fine.

才不是 你快冻僵了
You're not. You're freezing.

我讨厌高的地方
I don't like high places.

你怕打架
You can't fight.

你眼神不好
You can't see.

你讨厌高的地方你到底还有什么不怕的？
You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.

你干嘛来这儿 山姆？
What are you doing here, Sam?

我十八岁命名日那天早上 我父亲来找我
On the morning of my 18th Nameday, my father came to me.

“你就快成年了 ”他说…
"You're almost a man now," he said...

“但你不配拥有我的领地和封号”
"But you're not worthy of my land and title.

“明天你得宣布自己渴望披上黑衣”
Tomorrow, you're going to take the black,

“放弃一切继承权 动身北上”
forsake all claim to your inheritance and start North.

“如果你不照办 ”他说…
"If you do not," he said...

“那我们会外出打猎”
"Then we'll have a hunt

“而你的马将在林中某处跌倒”
and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble"

“你也会飞出马鞍摔死…”
and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die.

“至少我会这么告诉你母亲”
Or so I'll tell your mother.

“我没有比这更乐意的事了”
Nothing would please me more."

艾里沙爵士明天还会逼我打架 对吧？
Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

没错
Yes, he is.

你知道 我明天也不会有进步
I'm not going to get any better, you know?

放心罢
Well...

你明天也应该不会再退步了
You can't get any worse.

听说您在读一本无聊的书
I hear you're reading a boring book.

哼
Hmph.

派席尔是个大嘴巴
Pycelle talks too much.

是啊 他从来管不住嘴
Oh, he never stops.

您认识峡谷的修夫爵士吗？
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

这不奇怪
Not surprising. Until recently,

直到最近他都还只是个侍从 琼恩·艾林的侍从
he was only a squireJon Arryn's squire.

主子突然暴毙后
He was knighted almost immediately

突然间他就被封为了骑士
after his master's untimely death.

他为什么受封？
Knighted for what?

你又为什么要告诉我这些？
Why are you telling me this?

我答应凯特帮你
I promised cat that I'd help you.

这个修夫爵士人在哪儿？
Where is Ser Hugh?

我这就去跟他谈 这想法大错特错
I'll speak to him. A singularly bad idea.

看见那小子了么？
Do you see that boy there?

他是瓦里斯的小小鸟
One of Varys's little birds.

“八爪蜘蛛”对您的一举一动都很有兴趣
The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.

再瞧瞧那边
Now look there.

那是王后的人
That one belongs to the Queen.

那个假装读书的修女 您瞧见没？
And do you see that septa pretending to read her book?

她是瓦里斯还是王后的走狗？
Varys or the Queen?

都不是 她是我的眼线
No, she's one of mine.

您手下可有让您彻底信任的人？
Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?

有 聪明的回答是：没有 大人
Yes. The wiser answer was no, My Lord.

算了 送信给您这位模范部下
Get a message to this paragon of yours

让他去找修夫爵士
discreetlysend him to question Ser Hugh.

然后再派他去城里找某位武器师傅
After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.

那师傅在钢铁街顶上有间大屋子
He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.

为什么？ 我不是说了吗 我有我的眼线
Why? I have my observers, as I said,

据说艾林大人在死前数周里
and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn

多次拜访这位武器师傅
visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.

培提尔大人 或许我不应该不信任你
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.

不信任我
Distrusting me was the wisest thing

是你跳下马背以来所做过的最明智的事
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

…二十二 二十三
...Two, three,

二十四 二十五
24, five,

二十六 二十七
six, 27,

二十八 二十九… 修夫爵士？
28, 29Ser Hugh?

三十 三十一 三十二
30, 31, 32

修夫爵士！ 没看到我在忙吗？
Ser Hugh! As you can see, I'm busy.

我受艾德·史塔克公爵差遣而来
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,

他是当今首相
the Hand of the King.

我是他的侍卫队长
I'm the Captain of his guard.

不好意思 敢问您贵姓啊 爵士先…
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name, Ser...

我不是“爵士” 我没受封
No "Ser." I'm not a knight.

乔里·凯索
史塔克家族的侍卫队长

明白了 碰巧 我可是个爵士
I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.

修夫
琼恩·艾林的侍从

他说 倘若首相大人有意和他谈 他乐于接见
He said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself.

他现在是骑士了
He's a knight, you see.

好个骑士
Ah, a knight.

这些南方骑士活像趾高气昂的公鸡
They strut around like roosters down here.

其实半点风浪没经过
Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.

您不该亲自出马的 陛下
You shouldn't be out here, My Lord.

这里到处是眼线 让他们去看
There's no telling who has eyes where. Let them look.

前任首相是找过我 大人 找过我好几次
The former Hand did call on me, My Lord, several times.

托布·莫特
铁匠

遗憾的是我没那个荣幸 不曾为他打过什么
I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.

那艾林大人来干什么？
What did Lord Arryn want?

他总是来见那孩子
He always came to see the boy.

我也想见见那孩子
I'd like to see him as well.

遵命 大人 詹德利！
As you Gendry! My lord.

就是他了
Here he is.

以这年纪算得强壮 干起活来也挺勤快
Strong for his age. He works hard.

小子 让首相大人瞧瞧你打的头盔
Show the hand the helmet you made, lad.

做得很好 这不是拿来卖的
This is fine work. It's not for sale.

小子 这可是首相大人！
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

大人他看得上眼 你还不… 我做了给自己戴
If his lordship wants the helmI made it for me.

詹德利
铁匠学徒

大人 请千万原谅 没什么好原谅的
Forgive him, My Lord. There's nothing to forgive.

艾林大人来看你时 你们都说了些什么？
When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?

大人 他不过就问了些问题
He just asked me questions is all, My Lord.

什么问题？
What kind of questions?

他先问我的工作情况
About my work at first,

主人待我如何啊 我喜不喜欢这差事啊
if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.

接着他又问了我妈的事
But then he started asking me about my mother.

你母亲？ 问她是谁 长什么样这些
Your mother? Who she was, what she looked like.

你怎么回答？
What did you tell him?

我小时候她就死了
She died when I was little.

她是黄头发
She had yellow hair.

有时会唱歌给我听
She'd sing to me sometimes.

看着我
Look at me.

回去干活罢 小伙子
Get back to work, lad.

哪天要是他不想继续铸剑
If the day ever comes when that boy

想要实际弄把刀玩玩的话
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

叫他来找我
you send him to me.

查出什么了吗？
Find anything?

他是劳勃国王的私生子
King Robert's bastard son.

詹姆·兰尼斯特
御林铁卫队长 王后的孪生弟弟 “弑君者”

他喜欢这样子哟
Wo He likes that.

这是史塔克大人呈给国王陛下的信
This is for the King from Lord Stark.

我是交给你还是直接…
Should I leave it with

嘘
shhh.

听
Listen.

听见了吗？
Do you hear them?

你猜里面有多少女人？
How many do you think are in there with him?

猜猜看 三个？
Guess. Three?

四个？
Four.

每当我值班时他就干这事儿…
He likes to do this when I'm on duty

故意让我听见 以此羞辱我老姐
he makes me listen as he insults my sister.

请原谅 大人…
Forgive me, My Lord

要我原谅什么？你做过对不起我的事吗？
Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?

我们有过一面之缘
We've met before, you know.

一面之缘？奇怪 我怎么没印象
Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

攻打派克城时 某个下午我们曾并肩作战
The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.

啊
Ah.

你的疤是那一仗留的 是
That's where you got your scar? Aye.

想起来了
Oh.

有个葛雷乔伊家的人差点戳瞎我眼睛
One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

狗娘养的 他们嗜血成性
Vicious sons of whores. They like their bloodshed.

到最后流的却是自己的血
They stopped liking it at the end.

那是一场令人难忘的战役
That was a proper battle. Do you remember

你可记得密尔的索罗斯当先冲进城墙缺口？
Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?

他手里提着那把冒火的长剑
With his burning sword?

我到死也不会忘
I'll remember that till the day I die.

我在临冬城见到了葛雷乔伊的幼子
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

感觉就像在山顶上见着了鲨鱼
It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.

席恩？他是个好孩子
Theon? He's a good lad.

我对此深表怀疑
I doubt it.

我打赌 你闻起来像黑莓酱！
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!

过来 让我闻闻
Let me smell it. Come here.

我可以把这个交给你吗？
Can I leave this with you?

这是史塔克大人的信
The message from Lord Stark.

我不是史塔克大人的听差
I don't serve Lord Stark.

你跑哪儿去啦？ 跟山姆一起站岗
Where have you been? Watch duty.With Sam.

啊 跟猪排王子一起
Ah, prince porkchop.

他怎么不来吃饭？ 他不饿
Where is he? He wasn't hungry.

怎么可能！
Impossible!

够了！
That's enough.

山姆跟大家没什么两样
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

都是这个世界的弃儿
There was no place for him in the world,

走投无路才来到这里
so he's come here.

不管索恩怎么唆使
We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.

我们都不要在训练场上再欺负他了
Never again, no matter what Thorne says.

他现在是我们的手足兄弟 我们得保护他
He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.

你确实谈恋爱了啊 雪诺大人
You are in love, Lord Snow.

你们要孬种就孬种吧
You girls can do as you please.

但如果索恩叫我跟猪小姐打
But if Thorne puts me up against lady piggy,

我可是会切一大块火腿下来
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

不…准…动…山姆
No one touches Sam.

你们愣着干嘛？
What are you waiting for?

打他！
Attack him!

你给我上
You get in there.

打我
Hit me.

快啊 快打我！
Go on, hit me!

我投降！
I yield!

投降投降
Yield yield.

我投降
I yield.

你觉得这很有趣 是不是？
You think this is funny, do you?

等你们出了长城
When you're out there

不见天日之时
beyond The Wall with the sun going down,

是要一个值得信赖的战友
do you want a man at your back?

还是要守着一个哭鼻子的小屁孩？
Or a sniveling boy?

你叫这婊子来对我发号施令！
You send this whore to give me commands?

我应该把她的人头还给你才对！
I should have sent you back her head!

卡丽熙 请原谅 我只是照您吩咐去找他
Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.

别怕 没事了
Hush now. It's all right.

伊丽 你带她下去 是 卡丽熙
Irri, take her and leave us. Yes, Khaleesi.

你为什么要打她？！ 我要跟你说多少遍？
Why did you hit her?! How many times do I have to tell you?

不准你命令我！
You do not command me.

我没有命令你
I wasn't commanding you.

只是邀请你来共进晚餐
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

这是什么？ 我的礼物
What's this? It's a gift.

我特地为你做的 多斯拉克破布吗？
I had it made for you. Dothraki rags?

轮到你为我挑衣服啦？ 请别这样
Are you going to dress me now? Please.

一股子马屎味
This stinks of manure. All of it.

住手…停下！
Stopstop it.

你想把我变成他们中的一员 是不是？
You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?

接下来你就会叫我跟着绑辫子了
Next you'll want to braid my hair.

你还没打过胜仗
You've no right to a braid.

没有权利绑辫子
You've won no victories yet.

竟敢顶嘴！
You do not talk back to me!

你不过是马王的小贱货
You are a horselord's slut.

你现在唤醒睡龙之怒了…
And now you've woken the dragon

我是多斯拉克人的卡丽熙！
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki!

我是最伟大的卡奥的妻子
I am the wife of the great Khal

我肚子里怀着他的儿子
and I carry his son inside me.

你再敢对我动手
The next time you raise a hand to me

就把你双手剁掉
will be the last time you have hands.

据我所知好些长官
I know for a fact that some of the officers

会跑去鼹鼠村逛窑子
go to that brothel in mole's town.

是的
I wouldn't doubt it.

你不觉得这有点儿不公平吗？
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

要咱们发下毒誓
Making us take our vows while they sneak off

他们却偷溜出去找乐子
for a little sally on the side?

找乐子？ 这些规定真荒唐
Sally on the side? It's silly, isn't it?

难道只有打光棍才能守长城？
What, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate?

得了吧
It's absurd.

想不到你为这事愤愤不平
I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

为什么不呢？
Why not?

我胖就不该想这事儿？ 不是…
Because I'm fat? No.

我跟你一样想姑娘呢
But I like girls just as much as you do.

虽然她们不太想我就是了
They might not like me as much.

我从没…没跟姑娘睡过
I've neverbeen with one.

你大概睡过几百个罢
You've probably had hundreds.

不
No.

在这件事上
As a matter of fact,

我跟你一样
I'm the same as you.

啊！？
Yeah.

真令人难以置信
I find that hard to believe.

我差点睡了一个
I came very close once.

我和一个女孩儿独处一室 脱光了衣服…
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but

结果你不知道那话儿往哪放？
you didn't know where to put it?

我知道往哪儿放
I know where to put it.

难道她…
Was she...

又老又丑？
Old and ugly?

她年轻漂亮
Young and gorgeous.

她是个妓女 叫罗丝
A whore named Ros.

头发什么颜色的？
What color hair?

红的 好啊 我喜欢红发
Red. Oh, I like red hair.

那她的 呃…
And her, um...

她的…
Her...

说出来吓死 你有那么大？
You don't want to know. That good?

比你想的更大 噢 不是吧
Better. Oh no.

那…既然这个罗丝有这么完美的…
So why exactly

你怎么不跟她做呢？
did you not make love to Ros with the perfect?

我叫什么名字？
What's my name?

琼恩·雪诺啊
Jon Snow?

为什么我姓雪诺？
And why is my surname snow?

因为…
Because...

你是北方的私生子
You're a bastard from the North.

我从未见过我母亲
I never met my mother.

我父亲甚至连她的名字都不肯告诉我
My father wouldn't even tell me her name.

我不知她是生是死
I don't know if she's living or dead.

不知她是贵族
I don't know if she's a noblewoman

是渔妇
or a Fisherman's wife...

还是妓女
Or a whore.

因此当我在妓院的厢房里
So I sat there

看着罗丝宽衣解带的时候
in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.

我忽然不想做了
But I couldn't do it.

我满脑子想的是
Because all I could think was

如果我让她怀上孩子
what if I got her pregnant

这孩子将来
and she had a child,

岂不是又得叫雪诺？
another bastard named Snow?

这对孩子不公平
It's not a good life for a child.

所以到头来…
So...

你确实不知道那话儿该往哪儿放嘛
You didn't know where to put it?

玩得挺开心的
Enjoying yourselves?

小鬼们 你们看起来有点冷啊
You look cold, boys.

风有点冷
It is a bit nippy.

风有点冷 哼
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

关在屋子里 生着火 这还是夏天呢
indoors. It's still summer.

你们知道上个冬天是什么样吗？
Do you boys even remember the last winter?

过去多久了？差不多十年了罢？
How long has it been now? What, 10 years?

我可是记得一清二楚
I remember.

临冬城里是不是也天寒地冻啊？
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

不管仆人帮你生多少火
Were there days when you just couldn't get warm,

到头来仍感觉不到温暖？
never mind how many fires your servants built?

我自己生火 令人钦佩啊
I build my own fires. That's admirable.

告诉你小鬼 上个冬天
I spent six months out there, beyond The Wall

我在长城外边熬了整整六个月
during the last winter.

那次任务原定只用两周
It was supposed to be a twoweek mission.

有人说曼斯·雷德计划突袭东海望
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.

我们便外出去抓几个“舌头”
So we went out to look for some of his men

以侦察敌情
capture them, gather some knowledge.

曼斯·雷德手下的野人都是硬汉
The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.

你们永远别想跟他们相比
Harder than you'll ever be.

他们对自己的地盘了如指掌
They know their country better than we do.

他们知道暴风雪即将来临
They knew there was a storm coming in.

于是便躲进洞里 静待风雪过去
So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.

我们却在野外与暴风雪撞个正着
And we got caught in the open.

那咆哮的狂风
Wind so strong

把百尺大树连根拔起
it yanked 100foot trees straight from the ground,

谁敢脱手套
roots and all. If you took your gloves off

掏那话儿出来尿尿
to find your cock to have a piss,

手指头就废了
you lost a finger to the frost.

那时累月不见天日
And all in darkness.

真正的寒冷是什么样子
You don't know cold.

你们不可能知道
Neither of you do.

先死的是马
The horses died first.

我们既没东西喂它们吃 更没法为他们保暖
We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.

吃马肉没什么大不了的
Eating the horses was easy.

但等到后来兄弟们也开始倒下…
But later when we started to fall...

事情就没那么简单了
That wasn't easy.

我们怎没想到带几个你这样的小鬼呢？
We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?

白白胖胖的
Soft, fat boys like you.

足够应付十天半月咧
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you

骨头还可以熬汤
and still had bones leftover for soup.

很快又会有新兵过来
Soon we'll have new recruits

到时候我会把你们交给总司令
and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander

让他为你们分配职业
for assignment

别人会称你们作守夜人
and they will call you men of The Night's Watch,

但如果你们信以为真 就真是笨蛋
but you'd be fools to believe it.

你们只是乳臭未干的小毛头
You're boys still.

等冬天一来 你们就会像苍蝇一样
And come the winter you will die...

全部死翘翘
Like flies.

我打了他
I hit him.

我打了真龙之子
I hit the dragon.

你大哥雷加是最后的真龙传人
Your brother Rhaegar was the Last Dragon.

韦赛里斯连条蛇的影子都不如
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.

可他毕竟是真正的国王
He is still the true king.

说实话
The truth now:

你希望你哥哥坐上铁王座？
Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?

不
No.

可老百姓们等着他啊
But the common people are waiting for him.

伊利里欧说他们忙着缝制真龙旗帜 祈祷韦赛里斯早日解放他们
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.

老百姓祈祷的是风调雨顺 子女健康 以及永不结束的夏日
The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.

他们不关心王公贵族的权力游戏
They don't care what games the high lords play.

那你会为何事祈祷呢 乔拉爵士？
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

回家
Home.

我也是
I pray for home too.

我哥哥永远无法夺回七国
My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms.

就算我夫君给他军队 他也没有统御的能力
He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.

他永远无法带我们回家
He'll never take us home.

劳勃·拜拉席恩
国王

乔佛里·拜拉席恩
大王子

小两口还在赌气？
Lover's quarrel?

抱歉 我…？
I'm sorry. Do I...?

珊莎好孩子 这位是培提尔·贝里席伯爵 他…
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known

我是你们家的故友
an old friend of the family.

跟你母亲相识多年
I've known your mother a long long time.

他们为什么管你叫小指头啊？ 艾莉亚！
Why do they call you Littlefinger? Arya!

没礼貌！ 啊 没关系没关系
Don't be rude! No, it's quite all right.

这是因为我小时候特别瘦小
When I was a child I was very small

家族封地又位于狭小的五指半岛的缘故
and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers,

所以你瞧
so you see,

这是个恰如其分的绰号
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

老子在这儿坐了一整天了！
I've been sitting here for days!

瑟曦·兰尼斯特
王后

还他妈不开始！
Start the damn joust

老子快憋不住尿了！
before I piss myself!

诸神在上 那大块头是谁？
Gods, who is that?

格雷果·克里冈爵士
Ser Gregor Clegane.

外号“魔山”
They call him the Mountain.

格雷果·克里冈
兰尼斯特家臣 “魔山”

他是猎狗的哥哥
The hound's older brother.

那他的对手是谁？ 峡谷的修夫爵士
And his opponent? Ser Hugh of the Vale.

从前是琼恩·艾林的侍从
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

年轻人爬得很快哪
Lo how far he's come.

行了行了 别他妈瞎折腾！
Yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp.

快开打！
Have at it!

和你期望的不太一样？
Not what you were expecting?

没有人告诉过你猎狗和魔山两兄弟间
Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound?

温馨感人的手足情谊吗？
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

猎狗小时候
The Hound was just a pup,

大概六岁的时候吧
six years old maybe.

格雷果比他大几岁
Gregor a few years older

壮得像头牛 已经“远近闻名”
already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.

是啊 有的孩子
Some lucky boys

生性就挺残暴
just born with a talent for violence.

某天晚上 格雷果发现弟弟
One evening Gregor found his little brother

桑铎·克里冈
御林铁卫 “猎狗”

在火盆边玩玩具
playing with a toy by the fire

那是他的玩具
Gregor's toy,

一个木雕骑士
a wooden knight.

他二话不说
Gregor never said a word,

拎起弟弟的后颈
he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck

将弟弟的半边脸就往炭堆里按
and shoved his face into the burning coals.

他紧紧按住
Held him there

任由弟弟惨叫不停
while the boy screamed,

任由弟弟的脸庞被烧化
while his face melted.

没有几个人知道这个故事
There aren't very many people who know that story.

我不会说出去的 我保证
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

是的 请千万别说出去
No, please don't.

若是传到猎狗耳中

我们…能否抛开在国王大道上发生的不幸

If that's my job, then so be it.

你只是个兵吗？
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

只会领命办事？
You take your orders and you carry on.

你老爸把你哥培养成领袖
I suppose it makes sense.

却把你训练成不动脑筋的走卒
Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.

陛下 我所受的教育是时刻准备消灭敌人
I was also trained to kill my enemies, your Grace.

彼此彼此
As was I.

我可否在您用餐时为您娱乐助兴？
Might I entertain you while you eat?

让我唱一首歌颂令尊大人君临大捷的歌罢！
